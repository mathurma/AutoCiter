        <p>The hydrolysis of ATP associated with actin and profilin-actin polymerization is pivotal in cell motility. It is at the origin of treadmilling of actin filaments and controls their dynamics and mechanical properties, as well as their interactions with regulatory proteins. The slow release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) that follows rapid cleavage of ATP gamma phosphate is linked to an increase in the rate of filament disassembly. The mechanism of Pi release in actin filaments has remained elusive for over 20 years. Here, we developed a microfluidic setup to accurately monitor the depolymerization of individual filaments and determine their local ADP-Pi content. We demonstrate that Pi release in the filament is not a vectorial but a random process with a half-time of 102 seconds, irrespective of whether the filament is assembled from actin or profilin-actin. Pi release from the depolymerizing barbed end is faster (half-time of 0.39 seconds) and further accelerated by profilin. Profilin accelerates the depolymerization of both ADP- and ADP-Pi-F-actin. Altogether, our data show that during elongation from profilin-actin, the dissociation of profilin from the growing barbed end is not coupled to Pi release or to ATP cleavage on the terminal subunit. These results emphasize the potential of microfluidics in elucidating actin regulation at the scale of individual filaments.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Actin proteins assemble into microfilaments that control cell shape and movement by polymerizing or depolymerizing. These actin monomers can bind ATP or ADP molecules. The incorporation of an ATP-actin monomer into a growing filament results in rapid cleavage of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), followed by a slower release of Pi. As a consequence, actin filaments are composed mainly of ADP- and ADP-Pi-actin subunits, which have different depolymerization kinetics and mechanical properties, and can be targeted specifically by regulatory proteins that affect filament function. Hence, the understanding of many cellular processes requires a knowledge of the ADP/ADP-Pi composition of actin filaments at a molecular scale. This has so far remained elusive because traditional studies rely on measuring an average over many filaments in solution. To address this issue, we developed a microfluidics setup to monitor individual filaments with light microscopy while rapidly changing their chemical environment. We find that depolymerization accelerates progressively and corresponds to an exponential ADP-Pi-actin profile in the filament, meaning that each subunit releases its Pi with the same rate. Our method also provides novel insight into the function of profilin, a protein important for regulation of actin dynamics in cells, thus demonstrating the method's potential in the functional analysis of actin regulators.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Actin-based motile processes are driven by the polarized assembly of actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-LeClainche1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Bugyi1">[3]</xref>. As filaments elongate by endwise association of ATP-actin, ATP is rapidly cleaved into ADP-Pi. Slower release of Pi thus maintains a cap of ADP-Pi actin subunits at the growing filament barbed ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier2">[5]</xref>. The release of Pi destabilizes actin-actin bonds in the filament and lowers the rigidity of the polymer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Isambert1">[6]</xref>. Although it is known that the rate of dissociation of ADP-Pi-actin from the barbed ends is about 10-fold slower than the rate of dissociation of ADP-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Korn1">[7]</xref>, the detailed molecular mechanism of Pi release from F-actin during growth of the filament has remained elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Ohm1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier3">[9]</xref>. For Pi release, as for ATP γ-phosphate cleavage, two main mechanisms have been considered since long ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier2">[5]</xref> and continue to receive attention, notably from theoretical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Stukalin1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Ranjith1">[13]</xref>: in the random model, each ADP-Pi-actin subunit releases its Pi with equal probability, while the vectorial model assumes that Pi can only be released from an ADP-Pi-subunit adjacent to an ADP-subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In the latter model, an ADP/ADP-Pi boundary propagates toward the growing barbed end that displays a strict ADP-Pi cap, while the cap has a mixed composition in the random model.</p>

      <p>A detailed understanding of the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis on actin is required to further address how it may control or be affected by regulators of actin dynamics like profilin, capping proteins, or ADF/cofilin that bind differently to ADP- or ADP-Pi-actin. In particular, the role of ATP hydrolysis in the function of profilin has been a subject of debate since experimental evidence is available both against <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Blanchoin1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Kinosian1">[15]</xref> and in favor of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Romero1">[16]</xref> the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to filament elongation from profilin-actin. This point is difficult to address theoretically due to the many reactions that need to be considered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Yarmola1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Yarmola2">[18]</xref> and a full understanding of the effect of profilin on actin dynamics requires additional experimental data.</p>
      <p>Bulk solution studies, which provide measurements averaged on large numbers of filaments, have failed to deliver conclusive answers on the molecular mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. Recent theoretical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Stukalin1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Ranjith1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Vavylonis1">[19]</xref> have proposed to use the length fluctuations observed on individual actin filaments near the critical concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Fujiwara1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Kuhn1">[21]</xref> as a way to discriminate between the different models for ATP hydrolysis, but the required measurements seem difficult to achieve experimentally. In the present work, individual filaments growing with an ADP-Pi cap are rapidly switched to depolymerizing conditions using an original setup based on microfluidics, inspired from DNA studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Brewer1">[22]</xref>. The off-rate of actin subunits at the barbed end depends on the bound nucleotide, and provides insight into the ADP/ADP-Pi composition of the filament, and the mechanism of Pi release.</p>

        <title>Monitoring Elongation and Disassembly of Individual Filaments</title>
        <p>Spectrin-actin seeds were adsorbed on the surface of the glass coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g001">Figure 1D–E</xref>), at the bottom of the flow cell. Filaments grew from these seeds at a constant rate by flowing in a fluorescently labeled G-actin solution for a few minutes. Growth up to a few micrometers in length was monitored by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In the field of view, depolymerization from the free barbed ends was then triggered by switching to the flow channel that contained no actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g001">Figure 1C,F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s012">Video S1</xref>). The transition from elongation conditions to depolymerization conditions took place in less than a second. During depolymerization, epifluorescence microscopy could be used due to the absence of fluorescent background from solution.</p>
        <p>This microfluidic technique avoids the drawbacks of standard individual filament observations: The actin filaments are anchored at their pointed ends to the surface by the spectrin-actin seeds, but not immobilized along their length by anchor proteins. Filaments are aligned by the flow, making the monitoring of their contour length and the derivation of kymographs straightforward and accurate. In the conditions of our experiments, no pointed end elongation of filaments from the spectrin-actin seeds was detected. We verified that in the used range, the fraction of labeled actin, exposure time, and flow rate did not affect the kinetic parameters at the barbed end (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Pauses in the depolymerization of individual filaments have been observed, reminiscent of the recently reported “filament stabilization” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Kueh1">[23]</xref>. On a time scale of the order of 10 min, an increasing number of filaments exhibit pauses. The interruption times, at which these pauses begin, strongly vary from filament to filament. However, the depolymerization traces up to the interruption times are very similar, indicating that they are independent of the pauses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For more details on pauses, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s011">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p>

        <p>Filaments grown from MgATP-actin depolymerize at a pace that accelerates progressively, on a time scale of a few minutes, as the nucleotide content of the depolymerizing region evolves from ADP-Pi-rich to ADP-rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <p>To mimic the effect of vectorial Pi release, a strict ADP-Pi cap was artificially constructed by elongating filaments sequentially from MgATP-actin then CrATP-actin. These artificial filaments exhibited a sharp transition from a slow to a rapid rate of depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), differing from the smooth increase in depolymerization rate observed for filaments assembled only from MgATP-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Evidence for a slowly depolymerizing ADP-Pi cap was also observed in bulk solution measurements using pyrenyl-actin fluorescence. Filaments growing in a synchronous fashion from spectrin-actin seeds displayed an accelerating depolymerization when they were switched to depolymerizing conditions in early stages of assembly, while they displayed only the regular rapid depolymerization when switched to depolymerizing conditions upon approaching steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These data corroborate the view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier2">[5]</xref> that in a regime of rapid barbed end growth, a large cap of “young” slowly dissociating ADP-Pi subunits exists, which vanishes when growth slows down due to depletion of the pool of actin monomers, upon approaching steady state of assembly. The rapid depolymerization of ADP-F-actin was followed by a decline in rate that may be due to the cumulated effect of pauses, which are observed in single filament experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s001">Figure S1</xref>) but are not identifiable in the population of filaments in solution. Hence the kinetic analysis of depolymerization is feasible only on individual filaments and was carried out as follows.</p>
        <p>The depolymerization velocity <italic>v<sub>depol</sub></italic> of a segment of filament directly reflects its nucleotide composition. It can be estimated by local linear fits of the depolymerization curve (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Having monitored the elongation of the filaments, we know the age <italic>τ</italic> of the depolymerizing F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and we can hence determine <italic>v<sub>depol</sub></italic>(τ). We assume that the dissociation rate of each actin subunit from the barbed end depends only on its nucleotide state, and not on that of its neighbors. In contrast, we make no hypothesis on Pi release, which takes place in the core of the filament and may be affected by the nucleotide state of neighboring subunits. Since Pi release is slow compared to barbed-end depolymerization, it does not take place significantly within a sufficiently small segment while this segment disassembles (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s011">Text S1</xref>, equation 9). Thus, the depolymerization velocity <italic>v<sub>depol</sub></italic> of such a segment is determined by its fractions <italic>α<sub>ADP–Pi</sub></italic> of ADP-Pi- and (1−<italic>α<sub>ADP–Pi</sub></italic>) of ADP-actin subunits, which implies<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001161.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001161.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001161.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the depolymerization velocities of ADP-actin and ADP-Pi-actin subunits, respectively. Thus, measuring 1/<italic>v<sub>depol</sub></italic>(τ) for a depolymerizing filament provides a direct readout of <italic>α<sub>ADP–Pi</sub></italic>(τ), the profile of Pi release in aging F-actin. Note that the age-dependent function <italic>α<sub>ADP–Pi</sub></italic>(τ) can also be seen as the spatial profile of ADP-Pi-actin subunits along the filament, as age <italic>τ</italic> increases with the distance from the barbed-end. The function 1/<italic>v<sub>depol</sub></italic>(τ) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g002">Figure 2E</xref>. The local protomer composition is well fitted by a single-exponential decay, <italic>α<sub>ADP–Pi</sub></italic>(τ) = <italic>e<sup>−k<sub>r</sub></sup><sup>τ</sup></italic>, showing that Pi release is a random process, with a rate constant <italic>k<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.0068±0.0021 s<sup>−1</sup> (<italic>N</italic> = 20). This corresponds to a half-time of <italic>ln</italic>(2)/<italic>k<sub>r</sub></italic> = 102 s. This value is comparable to previous measurements of the Pi release rate constant <italic>k<sub>r</sub></italic> from bulk solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Carlier2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Melki1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Blanchoin2">[27]</xref> or individual filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Fujiwara2">[25]</xref> studies, with <italic>k<sub>r</sub></italic> ranging from 0.002 to 0.006 s<sup>−1</sup>. Filaments elongated at different actin concentrations, i.e. different velocities, or for different durations all displayed the same age-dependence of depolymerization rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), confirming that the ADP-Pi content depends only on the age of the F-actin, as expected for a random Pi release mechanism.</p>
        <p>To validate this analysis of the experimental 1/<italic>v<sub>depol</sub></italic>(τ) data, we have derived an exact formula for the observed filament length as a function of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s011">Text S1</xref>).

        <title>Elongation from Profilin-Actin Results in the Same ADP-Pi-Actin Content</title>
        <p>We have monitored filaments elongated with various amounts of G-actin (0.2 to 6 µM) and profilin (0 to 9 µM) and found that elongation from profilin-actin was 30% slower than from actin alone at the same concentration, as measured previously in solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-GutschePerelroizen1">[31]</xref>.

The coupling of profilin-actin elongation to ATP cleavage on the terminal subunit would result in the exposure of ADP-Pi actin subunits at the barbed end of growing filaments.

        <title>Elongation of Filaments from Profilin-Actin</title>
        <p>Free energy balance calculations in the case of profilin-MgATP-actin polymerization indicate the involvement of ATP hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Yarmola2">[18]</xref>. This idea is supported by the observation that profilin does not allow the elongation of filaments from MgADP-actin, CrATP-actin (which does not release its Pi), and CaATP-actin (which slowly hydrolyses ATP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Romero1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-GutschePerelroizen1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Pantaloni1">[32]</xref>. A description of filament elongation from profilin-actin emerges from these results, where the dissociation of profilin from the barbed end following incorporation of one actin subunit in the filament is coupled to either ATP cleavage or Pi release and constitutes the rate-limiting step observed at high profilin-actin concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-GutschePerelroizen1">[31]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Kinosian et al. have challenged this view, by introducing the effect of profilin on the affinity of actin for MgATP in order to balance the energy diagram for profilin-actin elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Kinosian1">[15]</xref>. In another study, these authors conclude that profilin binds MgADP-G-actin with a high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.4 µM) and that barbed end growth is supported by profilin-MgADP-G-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Kinosian2">[33]</xref>. This is contradicted by our results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s010">Figure S10</xref>), which show that profilin has a weak affinity for MgADP-G-actin (K<sub>d</sub> = 2.1 µM) and that profilin inhibits the elongation of filaments from MgADP-G-actin. We find identical concentrations of profilin-MgADP-G-actin at equilibrium with MgADP-F-actin and MgADP-G-actin when filaments are capped or non-capped, consistent with equilibrium thermodynamics of actin assembly in ADP.</p>
        <p>Blanchoin and Pollard also argued against the coupling of ATP hydrolysis by rapidly and directly measuring the rate of ATP cleavage on filaments elongating in the presence or absence of profilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Blanchoin1">[14]</xref>. In addition, they find no higher limit for the elongation rate at high profilin-actin concentrations, indicating that the dissociation of profilin from the barbed end is extremely fast. However, technical difficulties in the normalization of the two kinetics have been discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Romero1">[16]</xref> and the issue of the coupling of profilin-actin elongation to ATP hydrolysis remains unsettled.</p>
        <p>Our results show that the elongation of filaments from profilin-MgATP-actin is not coupled to Pi release in the filament. This indicates that the inability to elongate filaments from profilin-CrATP-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Romero1">[16]</xref> is not due to its very slow release of Pi, but may instead reflect a slow cleavage of CrATP (similar to CaATP-actin).</p>
        <p>Our results also imply that the elongation of filaments from profilin-MgATP-actin is not coupled to ATP cleavage on the terminal subunit. This does not rule out coupling to ATP hydrolysis altogether, and our data can be interpreted with the hypothesis of either direct, indirect, or no coupling of ATP hydrolysis to elongation from profilin-MgATP-actin.</p>
        <p>In the hypothesis of direct coupling, ATP cleavage could occur on the penultimate actin subunit as profilin dissociates from the barbed end, as proposed by Romero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Romero1">[16]</xref> This model considers the two terminal subunits of the barbed end and is compatible with our data. The model of indirect coupling proposed by Yarmola and Bubb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Yarmola2">[18]</xref> is also compatible with our data. In fact, our result that profilin accelerates the dissociation of ADP-Pi-actin subunits from the barbed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001161-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) validates one of the hypotheses underlying this model.</p>
        <p>We show that profilin-MgADP-actin dissociates faster than MgADP-actin from barbed ends and does not productively associate with barbed ends. In contrast, the elongation of filaments from profilin-MgATP-actin occurs with a critical concentration and an association rate constant similar to that of actin, and is unaffected by free profilin up to 100 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Blanchoin1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-GutschePerelroizen1">[31]</xref>. Further work, beyond the scope of the present study, will have to be undertaken to fully understand the consequences of our new results in the biological function of profilin.</p>
        <p>Since we find that profilin enhances the depolymerization of ADP-Pi- and ADP-actin, we propose that it should reinforce actin turnover in cells and enhance length fluctuations near the critical concentration, hereby facilitating their experimental observation. Based on our results, we expect that filament length fluctuations near the critical concentration should correspond to what can be computed for a random ATP hydrolysis, and not a vectorial one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Stukalin1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Ranjith1">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Experimental Outlook</title>
        <p>Our observations allow us to determine the ADP/ADP-Pi-actin composition of actin filaments. Our setup could also be used to get information on the ATP-actin cap of growing actin filaments: in the case of a vectorial ATP cleavage mechanism, rapidly elongating filaments would grow long ATP caps that could last long enough to be observed by depolymerization. The elongation rates that can be reached using our setup are limited by spontaneous nucleation (in the absence of profilin), and do not allow us to draw significant conclusions on the ATP cap. However, this limitation could be eliminated by triggering the polymerization of actin inside the flow cell. This could be achieved by implementing a “mixer” in the setup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Tabeling1">[34]</xref> in order to expose G-actin to KCl only seconds before reaching the spectrin-actin seeds.</p>
        <p>The results in this article show that accurate biochemical information can be derived from the observation of individual actin filaments in a microflow. The experimental setup we present here turns a microscope into a powerful tool for biochemical studies, as it circumvents most of the drawbacks of standard single filament microscopy in comparison to solution studies. It is versatile, and additional features, such as specific protein localization on the surface by patterning techniques, could further extend its potency. It should prove instrumental in the analysis of the mechanisms of actin regulation involved in many cellular processes.</p>

        <p>Flow cells were made with Poly Dimethyl Siloxane (PDMS) from Sylgard mounted on standard glass coverslips that were previously cleaned in NaOH 1 M. Molds made of SU-8 photoresist were built at the ESPCI clean room (Paris), with the assistance of Hélène Berthet. The microchambers used in this study were Y- or trident-shaped, having two or three entry channels, respectively. The microchannels were 42 µm high and 200–800 µm wide. After adsorption of spectrin-actin seeds, the surface of the coverslip was passivated with Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma).</p>
        <p>Flow rates were controlled and monitored using a MAESFLO system (Fluigent, Paris). For each channel, the flow rate could be modulated instantly throughout the experiment, between zero and a few tens of µL/min. For flow rates lower than 1 µL/min the filaments fluctuated thermally away from the surface and were difficult to image. Above 5 µL/min, the filaments aligned with the flow, and the amplitude of thermal fluctuations was reduced. Observations were carried out between 1 and 3 mm downstream of the entry channel junction.</p>
        <p>All measurements were carried out at room temperature.</p>

        <title>Image Acquisition and Analysis</title>
        <p>Observations were carried out on an inverted Olympus IX71 microscope, with a 60× objective (and an additional 1.6× magnification in some cases), using TIRF or epifluorescence. Images were acquired by a Cascade II camera (Photometrics). The experiment was controlled using Metamorph. The time interval between images was typically 4–20 s, but longer intervals (30–120 s) were also used in control experiments. Image stacks were analyzed using ImageJ, and contrast was enhanced using the KymoToolBox plugin (available from <email xlink:type="simple">fabrice.cordelieres@curie.u-psud.fr</email>). Filament lengths were extracted from the images using the snake fit program from the laboratory of D. Vavylonis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Smith1">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The local depolymerization velocity was estimated by fitting linearly the length-versus-time plot around a given point, over a symmetrical window of 4–12 time intervals. We verified that, over these time ranges, increasing the window of the linear fit had no effect other than reducing the noise in the velocity profile.</p>
        <p>By monitoring the elongation of filaments, we have verified that filaments grew with a constant polymerization velocity <italic>v<sub>pol</sub></italic>, which was compatible with the on-rates determined in solution assays: k<sub>on</sub> = 10 µM<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for actin, and k<sub>on</sub> = 7 µM<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for profilin-actin. Fragmentation events were rare, and pauses during elongation or annealing events were not observed. In some experiments, the filaments were not monitored during elongation, and their growth rate was computed by measuring the length before and after elongation, and dividing the difference by the duration of elongation. In these experiments, we could verify that nearly all filaments exhibited the expected elongation rate. The few filaments that did not, presumably due to fragmentation, were discarded.</p>
        <p>The age τ is the time elapsed since the assembly of a portion of filament. Upon depolymerization, it is determined by the following equation: τ = t+(L(t = 0)−L(t))/<italic>v<sub>pol</sub></italic>, where L(t) is the length of the depolymerizing filament, at time t after the onset of depolymerization.</p>
        <p>In our computations we considered that each actin subunit contributes to 2.7 nm of the filament length.</p>

        <title>Control Experiments</title>
        <p>We have performed experiments with different exposure times (10–50 ms in TIRF, and 100–500 ms in epifluorescence) and with different time intervals between acquisitions (4–120 s) and no effect on the depolymerization curves could be detected. We have monitored the depolymerization of filaments labeled with various fractions of Alexa488-actin (7%–20%), and no difference was observed. The effect of photobleaching was estimated by repeatedly measuring the length of fluorescent segments embedded in non-labeled filaments (fabricated by sequentially polymerizing filaments with labeled and non-labeled actin) and was found negligible in our experiments.</p>
        <p>We have verified that the flow of liquid had no impact on the dynamics of the filaments, by performing the following measurements. Filaments were elongated under various constant flow rates, ranging from a few tens of nL/min to a few tens of µL/min, and the resulting elongations were the same. Filaments were depolymerized under constant flow rates, ranging from two to a few tens of µL/min, and the resulting depolymerization curves were the same. Filaments were depolymerized with flow rates that varied over a period of 30 s (25 s at 200 nL/min, followed by 5 s at a few tens of µL/min, during which the image was acquired) and the resulting depolymerization curves were the same.</p>
        <p>We verified that the vicinity of the coverslip surface had no impact on the dynamics of the filaments, by performing the following measurements. 6 µm-diameter polystyrene carboxylate beads were incubated with spectrin-actin seeds and anchored to the bottom of the flow cell. We monitored filaments growing from the spectrin-actin seeds that were at least 3 µm above the coverslip surface. These filaments aligned with the flow, which maintained them entirely in the focal plane. The depolymerization curves were the same as for filaments grown from seeds anchored directly on the glass coverslip.</p>
        <p>As a control for experiments with 100 mM Pi, depolymerization of filaments was monitored at pH 7 (Hepes buffer) with K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to adjust the ionic strength. The observed depolymerization was the same as in standard F-buffer.</p>

We simulated the polymerization and depolymerization of 10,000 filaments with rates as specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s011">Text S1</xref>, i.e. including ATP cleavage. Average values (blue dots) ± standard deviations (blue dashed lines) are depicted. The continuous red line is the solution of equation 12 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s011">Text S1</xref> for the same parameters as used in the simulations. The fit is sufficient, since the deviation is much smaller than the optical resolution. The small error is mainly caused by neglecting the cleavage step. In a further improved approximation, we could consider ATP cleavage by an effective release rate which takes both cleavage and release into account. Thus we replace <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001161.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by <italic>k<sub>r</sub>k<sub>c</sub></italic>/(<italic>k<sub>r</sub></italic>+<italic>k<sub>c</sub></italic>) in equation 12 of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001161.s011">Text S1</xref>. This yields the green line, which is in very good agreement with the simulations. Inset: The exponential relation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001161.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001161.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is also found for simulated trajectories. The agreement with the analytical results shows that fitting the experimental 1/<italic>v</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>) curves with an exponential indeed reveals the correct parameters.</p>

          <p>The depolymerization of ADP-actin filaments slows down upon exposure to Pi. A filament elongated from MgADP-actin was depolymerized in standard F-buffer for 60 s (blue diamonds) then in the presence of 25 mM Pi (red squares). Lines represent linear fits of the data. At this resolution, the transition to a slow depolymerization rate appears instantaneous upon exposure to Pi, as expected from the rapid Pi association to the barbed end reported by Fujiwara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Fujiwara2">[25]</xref>. In the presence of 25 mM Pi, ADP-actin filaments depolymerized at a rate of 0.64±16 subunits/s, which is also in agreement with the values reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Fujiwara2">[25]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Filaments do not elongate from MgADP-G-actin in the presence of profilin. (A) Barbed end and pointed end growths from 16.4 µM (blue) and 10.5 µM (red) MgADP-G-actin (2% pyrene-labeled) were initiated using 0.2 nM spectrin-actin seeds (open circles) or 10 nM gelsolin-actin seeds (closed squares), respectively, in the presence of the indicated amounts of profilin. The extent of F-actin assembled at equilibrium (reached in less than 1 h) was measured. Identical linear decrease in F-ADP-actin with capped and non-capped filaments shows that profilin binds MgADP-G-actin with K<sub>d</sub> = 2.1 µM (this value was confirmed by measurements of tryptophan fluorescence quenching upon binding of profilin to actin—unpublished data) and that profilin-MgADP-G-actin does not productively associate with barbed nor pointed ends. Profilin-MgADP-G-actin hence accumulates in solution as described by [PA] = [P]<sub>0</sub> A<sub>c</sub>/(A<sub>c</sub>+K<sub>d</sub>), where [P]<sub>0</sub> is the total profilin concentration and A<sub>c</sub> is the critical concentration for ADP-G-actin assembly at either barbed or pointed ends. In contrast, in Kinosian et al.'s view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001161-Kinosian2">[33]</xref> the proposed productive association of profilin-MgADP-G-actin at barbed ends specifically would have led to a steeper decrease of F-actin concentration for capped filaments than for non-capped filaments in ADP, like the observed behavior in ATP. (B) Elongation rate of MgADP-actin filaments, in the presence of 5 µM MgADP-G-actin and the indicated amounts of profilin, measured on individual filaments in a microflow.</p>

          <p>Individual actin filament, elongated and subsequently depolymerized in a microfluidic flow. The filament is elongated for 6 min, from an initial length of 2.4 µm to a final length of 14.3 µm (30 s between images, acquired in TIRF microscopy). It is depolymerized by switching to buffer with no actin, and depolymerization lasts 12 min (20 s between images, acquired in epifluorescence microscopy). Liquid is flowing from left to right. Contrast was enhanced as described in the text.</p>
