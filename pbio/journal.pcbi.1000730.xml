<p>Due to the large number of putative microRNA gene targets predicted by sequence-alignment databases and the relative low accuracy of such predictions which are conducted independently of biological context by design, systematic experimental identification and validation of every functional microRNA target is currently challenging. Consequently, biological studies have yet to identify, on a genome scale, key regulatory networks perturbed by altered microRNA functions in the context of cancer. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time how phenotypic knowledge of inheritable cancer traits and of risk factor loci can be utilized jointly with gene expression analysis to efficiently prioritize deregulated microRNAs for biological characterization. Using this approach we characterize miR-204 as a tumor suppressor microRNA and uncover previously unknown connections between microRNA regulation, network topology, and expression dynamics. Specifically, we validate 18 gene targets of miR-204 that show elevated mRNA expression and are enriched in biological processes associated with tumor progression in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). We further demonstrate the enrichment of bottleneckness, a key molecular network topology, among miR-204 gene targets. Restoration of miR-204 function in HNSCC cell lines inhibits the expression of its functionally related gene targets, leads to the reduced adhesion, migration and invasion in vitro and attenuates experimental lung metastasis in vivo. As importantly, our investigation also provides experimental evidence linking the function of microRNAs that are located in the cancer-associated genomic regions (CAGRs) to the observed predisposition to human cancers. Specifically, we show miR-204 may serve as a tumor suppressor gene at the 9q21.1–22.3 CAGR locus, a well established risk factor locus in head and neck cancers for which tumor suppressor genes have not been identified. This new strategy that integrates expression profiling, genetics and novel computational biology approaches provides for improved efficiency in characterization and modeling of microRNA functions in cancer as compared to the state of art and is applicable to the investigation of microRNA functions in other biological processes and diseases.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>MicroRNAs regulate the expression of genes in cells and are important in cancer development and progression. Designing new microRNA-based treatments requires the understanding of their mechanisms of action. Previous biological studies lack in depth since only a few genes are confirmed as microRNA targets. Additionally, key biological systems perturbed by altered microRNA functions in the context of cancer remain to be identified. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how genetic knowledge about the inheritance of cancer can be utilized jointly with data about the expression of genes in cancer samples to model deregulated microRNAs and their functions at multiple scales of biology. Our approach further uncovers previously unknown connections between microRNAs, their regulated genes, and their dynamics. Using head and neck cancer as a model, we predict the presence, functions, and gene targets of a new tumor suppressor microRNA in a cancer-associated chromosomal region where a candidate gene has not been identified. We then confirm their validity with extensive and thorough biological characterization and show attenuation of lung metastasis in mice. The discovery of molecular networks regulated by microRNAs could be exploited for the design of new treatments as an alternative to the single-gene target paradigm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the discovery of microRNAs as important regulators of broad biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Brennecke1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Poy1">[5]</xref>, characterization of their functions in cancer has been hindered by lack of microRNA profiling information in tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Previous reports show that only one or a few gene targets, identified among predicted or differentially expressed genes, were directly targeted by the microRNA under investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Huang1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Tavazoie1">[8]</xref>. While sequence-based computational algorithms have been applied for predicting all potential microRNA gene targets; false positive rates remains relatively high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Sethupathy1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lewis1">[10]</xref>. Further, sequence-based predictions are unable, by design, to account for biological contexts (e.g. cell and tissue types, normal or disease conditions) and thus are not optimized for predicting the biological function of genes targeted by cancer microRNAs. Moreover, genome-scale and biological studies have yet to identify key regulatory networks perturbed by altered microRNA functions in cancer.</p>
<p>To investigate microRNA function in HNSCC, we sought to develop an effective computational approach that is complementary to microRNA profiling and, in addition, is capable of simultaneously predicting tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as their functional targets from gene expression. In this report we illustrate how phenotypic knowledge of genetic disorders (OMIM database) can be utilized jointly with gene expression analyses to achieve this goal. Using this approach, we selected miR-204 among ten prioritized microRNAs for biological characterization, as miR-204 is located at the cancer-associated genomic region (CAGR) 9q21.1–q22.3 locus exhibiting high frequency of Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human HNSCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-AhSee1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Scully1">[15]</xref>, and a CAGR for which candidate tumor suppressor gene targets have not been identified. Additionally, we report the first computationally predicted and biologically validated microRNA-regulated network that is dependent on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) whose overexpression occurs in over 80% of head and neck cancer. We further demonstrate that gene targets of miR-204 exhibit enriched bottleneck and hub network topology properties in a predicted protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). Moreover, we confirm the validity of our computational predictions of a microRNA function, as well as its gene targets and system's properties through conducting extensive and thorough biological characterization using a clinically relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> metastatic model of head and neck cancer.</p>
<p>In summary, we show how such a high throughput system's strategy can accelerate the investigation of microRNA function in cancer by illustrating altered complex biological processes and regulatory pathways associated with microRNA dysfunction in cancer, by identifying among all putative microRNA gene targets only those that are dysregulated, and by elucidating molecular interactions underpinning microRNA regulation of malignant transformation and progression. The ability to characterize tumor suppressor microRNAs through a network analysis of mRNA expression datasets would be a major advance with potentially wide application. Further, we provide experimental evidence linking microRNA function to the genetic risk of HNSCC. We show at the LOH 9q21.1–22.3 locus, miR-204 could serve as a tumor suppressor of HNSCC oncogenesis and progression.</p>

<title>Combining genome-scale predictive strategies to prioritize candidate microRNAs for biological characterization in HNSCC</title>
<p>At the time of initiating this study, comprehensive analysis of microRNA expression profile in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) was not available and would have required time-consuming accruement of tumor tissues for conducting such analysis, a situation that is not limited to HNSCC research. We hypothesized that the development of a computational capability to simultaneously predict tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as their functional targets from more widely available genome-wide gene expression datasets could be an efficient reverse engineering approach for identifying deregulated microRNAs and their functional gene targets.</p>
<p>We first developed IMRE, a statistical method to predict altered expression of microRNAs from genome-wide mRNA expression and putative microRNA targets databases (Supporting Figure 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This strategy is based, in part, on the observations that at genome scale the expression of microRNAs and their direct mRNA targets are, in general, inversely correlated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Huang2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Farh1">[17]</xref>. To conduct this analysis, we integrated five complementary microRNA target databases to generate “miRNOME” that contains 534 human microRNAs and 17,343 microRNA gene targets (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>). We validated this method using two independent cancer expression profiling experiments in GEO comprised of paired mRNA and microRNA expressions for tumors and normal tissue (GSE2564 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lu1">[18]</xref>: multiple epithelial cancer; GSE8126 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Ambs1">[19]</xref>: prostate cancer). IMRE-predicted downregulated microRNAs that are exclusively inferred from mRNA expression and microRNA targets datasets (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) were enriched in the expression analysis of the corresponding microRNA array dataset (GSE2564: <italic>P</italic> = 0.014; GSE8126: <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002 respectively, cumulative hypergeometric test, data not shown). A recent study also demonstrated the increased prediction specificity of microRNA and its gene target relationship via intersecting the results of multiple prediction algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Varambally1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we applied the IMRE method to analyze two independent HNSCC mRNA microarray datasets for predicting deregulated microRNAs from genome-wide mRNA expression (Supporting Figure 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>): <underline>first</underline>, the GSE6631 set that provides differential mRNA gene expression between 22 HNSCC non-microdissected patient tumor samples and their paired normal squamous tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Kuriakose1">[21]</xref>, and <underline>second</underline>, the GSE2379 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Cromer1">[22]</xref> set that contains 34 micro-dissected node-positive HNSCC tumors of the hypopharynx. We noted that vast majority of the known microRNAs had at least one putative target in the top 500 deregulated genes of the HNSCC expression arrays (GSE6631), with a median of 19 targets. Therefore, it is unfeasible to manually select microRNA candidates from their deregulated targets for biological validation. Applying IMRE method to each dataset, we predicted a set of down-regulated microRNAs in HNSCC (113 and 43, respectively; FDR ≤0.05, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), of which 34 were consistently found in both prediction sets (<italic>P-value</italic> = 2.0×10<sup>−16</sup>, Fisher's exact test, Figure 1A and Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>, FDR &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Predictions of up-regulated microRNAs did not reach reproducible statistical significance (not shown).</p>
<p>To further reduce the number of microRNAs to the most promising candidates for HNSCC, we conducted a statistical enrichment analysis of putative microRNA targets among inheritable cancer genes in the OMIM human disease gene database [<underline>O</underline>nline <underline>M</underline>endelian <underline>I</underline>nheritance in <underline>M</underline>an, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/</ext-link> <underline>(downloaded Dec. 1, 2006)]</underline>. OMIM contains 610 biologically validated cancer genes among which 586 (96%) are predicted targets of 527 microRNAs in miRNOME. We observed that each of the 527 microRNAs could, on average, target 30 OMIM cancer genes (not shown). Thus, it is also unfeasible to manually select microRNA candidates from OMIM cancer genes for biological validation. Our analyses identified 46 microRNAs significantly enriched in the inheritable cancer gene subset of OMIM in the miRNOME (Figure 1A; Table 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s003">Protocol S1/Section A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s004">Dataset S1</xref>). Since microRNAs can be deregulated across cancers of different tissue origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Rosenfeld1">[23]</xref>, we performed a review of literature and confirmed the validity of these 46 predictions (OMIM; Supporting Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.039; cumulative hypergeometric test, Table 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Thereafter, we reduced the list of candidates in HNSCC to ten microRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) that were predicted in the HNSCC gene expression (34 microRNAs; Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>) as well as in inheritable cancer genes (46 microRNAs; Table 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>). Among the ten prioritized microRNAs, four belong to the let-7 tumor suppressor microRNA family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>miR-204 is located at the genomic imbalanced 9q21.1-22.3 locus associated with genetic predisposition for head and neck cancer</title>
<p>We chose miR-204 among the ten prioritized microRNAs for thorough biological characterization based on the following considerations. <underline>First</underline>, miR-204 is located within the sixth intron of the host gene <underline>t</underline>ransient <underline>r</underline>eceptor <underline>p</underline>otential <underline>m</underline>elastatin <underline>3</underline> cation channel (TRPM3, NM_020952) and is transcribed in the same direction as TRPM3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-LagosQuintana1">[24]</xref>.

With the exception of let-7g that is located at the 3p21 locus (note that let7g is also included in the class of microRNAs with related mature sequence “Let7/98”), the other 7 prioritized microRNAs are not in the cancer associated genomic regions (CAGRs). <underline>Third</underline>, while potential tumor suppressor gene candidates have been identified for other CAGRs in HNSCC, gene candidates possessing tumor suppressor activity associated with the 9q21 locus have not been identified.

<p>We first examined miR-204 host gene TRPM3 expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and observed near complete TRPM3 suppression in four micro-dissected HNSCC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and in a panel of 10 low passage HNSCC cell lines generated from tumors of diverse head and neck locations (Figure 1C and Table 5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Brachman1">[26]</xref>. We subsequently measured miR-204 expression in HNSCC tumors and cell lines. Consistent with the observed near complete loss of TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figures 1B–C</xref>), miR-204 expression was inhibited in all four tumors by 85% to 99% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), and by more than 90% in all ten HNSCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) compared to samples of pooled normal buccal mucosa.

<p>Since miR-204 was also predicted in the OMIM analysis to be associated with lymphoma (Table 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>), we quantified miR-204 expression in immortalized “normal B cell 11365” and three Burkitt B-cell lymphoma cell lines and found its expression significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Further, paired comparison of miR-204 expression between 6 types of adenocarcinomas and their respective normal tissues was conducted using the microRNA array dataset GSE2564 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lu1">[18]</xref>. miR-204 was significantly down-regulated in breast (<italic>P</italic> = 0.014), kidney (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) and prostate (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Additionally, significant miR-204 down-regulation was recently reported in a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia bearing cytoplasmic mutated nucleophosmin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Garzon1">[27]</xref>. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, the accuracy and efficiency of joint analyses of mRNA expression, inheritable disease genes, and microRNA target databases to prioritize deregulated microRNAs for biological characterization. Collectively, these biological findings support the validity of our computational predictions of miR-204 downregulation in HNSCC and suggest that it may possess tumor suppressor activity.</p>

<title>miR-204 suppresses the expression of its functionally prioritized targets</title>
<p>To provide evidence that miR-204 can directly suppress the expression of its predicted targets in HNSCC, examination of the 3′UTR confirmed that all 34 predicted target genes contain at least one miR-204 binding site as expected by our predictions using sequence homology databases of the miRNOME (Table 8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

We conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> miR-204 gain-of-function analyses by transiently transfecting JSQ3 and SQ38 HNSCC cells with mature miR-204 mimics (Dharmacon) to enhance miR-204 function in these two cell lines. Restoration of miR-204 function achieved significant inhibition (between 30% to 75%) of endogenous mRNA expression in 18 out of 21 predicted targets examined for both cell lines, while non-specific control mimics had no significant effect (Figure 2D and Supporting Figures 4–5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>). The specificity of miR-204 mimics was further confirmed by unaltered expression of four endogenous housekeeping genes (GUSB, HPRT1, HUPO and PPIA) that lack target homology to miR-204 (Figure 2D and Supporting Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>).

<title>miR-204 gene targets exhibit significant topological properties in a HNSCC protein interaction network predicted by network modeling</title>
<p>Following functional enrichment analysis of upregulated miR-204 targets in HNSCC, we next examined the role of miR-204 targets in modulating the function of a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). To identify genome-wide changes in PPINs associated with altered microRNA functions in HNSCC, we first integrated seven protein-protein interaction databases (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and generated a “genome-scale PPIN” that contains 44,695 protein-protein interactions and 7,321 predicted human genes targets for the 532 microRNAs in the miRNOME. We subsequently could map 260 out of 382 (68%) up-regulated genes in GSE6631 to the PPIN (refer to as “HNSCC PPIN”), of which 24 were miR-204 targets predicted in miRNOME. We next computed the empirical probability of interactions among these 260 genes in the network using permutation resampling (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To identify the most important interactions in the HNSCC PPIN, we retained proteins for which the number of observed interactions was significantly increased in single protein network modeling as compared to those found in the empirical distribution (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As a result, we identified a protein regulatory network in HNSCC consisting of 56 prioritized upregulated genes in GSE6631 at a low false discovery rate of 7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3</xref> and, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) (referred to as “prioritized HNSCC PPIN”).

<p>We next analyzed two topological features of the PPIN: the “hub” and “bottleneck” properties. “Hubs”, the highly connected node proteins, and “bottlenecks”, the key connector proteins, are central to controlling the connectivity of biological sub-networks to one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Hahn1">[29]</xref>. Further, our prior studies showed proteins possessing both properties (hub-bottleneck) as essential and efficient network components to alter the functional output of a PPIN upon their dynamic changes in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Yu1">[30]</xref>. Here, we observed significant enrichment of hubs, bottlenecks, and hub-bottleneck proteins in the 56-gene “prioritized HNSCC PPIN” as compared to either the “genome-scale PPIN” or to the “HNSCC PPIN” (hub: <italic>P</italic> = 8.7×10<sup>−8</sup>; bottleneck: <italic>P</italic> = 7.31×10<sup>−7</sup>; hub-bottleneck: <italic>P</italic> = 1.61×10<sup>−8</sup>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Additionally, the proportion of hub-bottleneck genes was further enriched among the seven miR-204 targets present in the “prioritized HNSCC PPIN” (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002; Fisher's exact test, MMP9, SHC1, CDC25B and AURKB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figures 3A–B</xref>). Moreover, in a genome-scale analysis, we observed a statistically significant association between the proteins that exhibit PPIN network topology, such as hub and bottleneck properties, and the number of predicted microRNA targets. Indeed, bottleneck proteins and hub-bottleneck protein of the “genome-scale PPIN” were both targeted on average by more microRNAs than those that are neither bottleneck nor hub-bottleneck (bottleneck: <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009; hub-bottleneck: <italic>P</italic> = 0.022, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These results indicate that the enrichment of bottleneck and hub-bottleneck properties among miR-204 gene targets in the “prioritized HNSCC PPIN” is a system's property of microRNAs. They also suggest that the efficiency and specificity of microRNAs in regulating biological functions is further strengthened through alteration of the translation of these bottleneck proteins.</p>
<p>In a protein-protein interaction network, proteins that are tightly linked are likely to function in the same biological process or pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lee1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Pujana1">[32]</xref>.

Two EGFR-dependent regulatory sub-networks were identified: cell cycle regulation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling/Cell-matrix adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Based on the importance of hub-bottleneck genes in regulating the function of a PPIN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Yu2">[33]</xref>, the enrichment of four hub-bottlenecks miR-204 targets in the EGFR-dependent “prioritized HNSCC PPIN” predicts that their up-regulation upon miR-204 suppression in HNSCC could significantly augment cell cycle and extracellular matrix remodeling.</p>

Control mimics-treated SQ38 cells efficiently extravasated, established micro-metastases in 100% of animals and produced a mean number of lung metastatic foci of 75 on the whole lung surface.

<title>Expression pattern of 19 miR-204 targets identified a subtype of HNSCC tumors exhibiting an EGFR-pathway signature and predicted earlier relapse</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we developed an efficient combined computational and biological approach to predict and to prioritize cancer microRNAs for biological investigation. We demonstrated this strategy as an effective economical alternative to comprehensive microRNA analysis in cancers such as HNSCC for which prior genomic array datasets (mRNA or microRNA) are less abundant. This approach also allowed the identification of functional gene targets of the deregulated microRNAs that would otherwise require paired profiling of mRNA and microRNA expression for which the feasibility is often limited by the additional costs, or by the lack of access to the tissue. Employing this method that integrates the analysis of microRNA target predictions, differential HNSCC gene expression and the cancer genes in the OMIM genetic dataset, we identified and characterized miR-204, located within its host gene TRPM3 at the 9q21.1–q22.3 region frequently incurring allelic loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-AhSee1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Scully1">[15]</xref>, as a potential tumor suppressor microRNA of HNSCC and possibly of other epithelial cancers. The high propensity of LOH at 9q21.1–q22.3 that occurs in 37% HNSCC pre-malignant conditions, further increases to 67% in cancer state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-AbouElhamd1">[14]</xref> suggesting the presence of tumor suppressor gene candidates. While tumor suppressor genes at other frequent allelic loss loci in HNSCC have been identified, gene candidates responsible for the tumor suppressor activity associated with the 9q21 locus remain elusive. Here, we provided a plausible mechanism that loss of tumor suppressor function of miR-204 as a result of allelic imbalance at 9q21.1–q22.3 may significantly increases the genetic susceptibility to HNSCC oncogenesis and progression. LOH at this locus is also seen in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lichun1">[42]</xref> and SCC of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Sato1">[43]</xref> suggesting a common somatic genetic lesion underlies the development of SCC of diverse tissue origin. The highly coordinated and nearly complete suppression of miR-204 and its host gene TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g001">Figure 1B–E</xref>) raises the possibility that TRPM3 mRNA expression may serve as a marker to indicate miR-204 expression status in HNSCC or other tumors, and also potentially LOH at 9q21.1–q22.3. Since a small variation in the expression of a specific microRNA is expected to affect the expression of tens or hundreds of target mRNAs, genetic variations in a microRNA expression at the chromosomal break point, as we observed with miR-204 at the 9q21.1–q22.3 locus, could represent an effective mechanism of cancer predisposition, a hypothesis that is supported by emerging experimental evidences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Calin1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Sevignani1">[45]</xref>. A few recent studies have reported genome-wide microRNA expression changes using HNSCC cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Kozaki1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Chang1">[49]</xref> or tumor tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Chang1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Cervigne1">[51]</xref>. While similar miR-204 downregualtion was reported in head and neck cancer cell lines based on microarray analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Kozaki1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Tran1">[48]</xref>, its expression status was not further confirmed by PCR or other methods and its biological functions were not explored. Additionally, since its identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-LagosQuintana1">[24]</xref> biological characterization of miR-204 functions in normal development remain limited. Thus far, miR-204 was implicated in affecting global mRNA expression levels in the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Arora1">[52]</xref>; and was shown to regulate mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Huang3">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>Through enrichment analysis and network modeling using mRNA gene expression profile, we identified a set of functionally related miR-204 targets that showed increased mRNA expression in HNSCC upon miR-204 suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g002">Figures 2A–C</xref>). The presence of miR-204 binding sites (Table 8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>), the coordinated up-regulation and the ability of increased miR-204 function to specifically inhibit the expression of 18 out of 21 gene targets (86%) (Figure 2D, Supporting Figures 4–5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>) suggest that these predicted genes are very likely selective and direct miR-204 targets in HNSCC. This finding is consistent with the genome-wide association between microRNA binding sites and the ability of corresponding targeting microRNAs to alter their gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lim1">[54]</xref>. This is the first report of a large set of functionally related cancer microRNA targets that was identified via high throughput computational approaches and confirmed biologically. In addition, the joint analyses of sequence-base information and mRNA expression arrays yielded an accuracy rate of 86% of miR-204 target predictions which surpasses the published accuracy (about 40%) of each sequence-based method when used alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lewis1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-John1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-GriffithsJones1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>More broadly, we demonstrated a computational framework for predicting altered regulatory networks and biological functions associated with differentially expressed microRNA targets. Indeed, our combined systems biology approach uncovered previously unknown connections between microRNA regulation, network topology, and expression dynamics for which we obtained thorough biological validations. While genome-scale analyses of interactions among microRNA gene targets in the context of a cellular or protein-protein interaction networks have been conducted computationally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Cui1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Liang1">[59]</xref>, such methods and observations await biological confirmation. Here we significantly extended the observations of two recent reports on network modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Lee1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Pujana1">[32]</xref> and demonstrated the feasibility and validity of deploying statistical and bioinformatics approaches to derive regulatory networks corresponding to altered expression of proteins targeted by microRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Further, combining functional enrichment analysis with network modeling leads to the unbiased prioritization of an EGFR-dependent protein regulatory network connected via up-regulated gene targets of microRNAs in human HNSCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Topological analyses of hub and bottleneck properties further identified key regulatory proteins within the EGFR network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figures 3A–B</xref>). miR-204 appeared critical to regulate the function of this “prioritized HNSCC PPIN” as its gene targets exhibited significant enrichment of hub and bottleneck properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figures 3A–B</xref>). Since the EGFR network was derived from overexpressed genes in HNSCC, the functional enrichment of its 56 proteins suggests their positive regulation of cell cycle, cell/matrix adhesion and extracellular matrix modeling. Using this approach, the biological effect of altering the function of a specific microRNA, such as miR-204, can be accurately predicted via its gene targets that are key regulators of a protein network. Accordingly, enhancement of miR-204 function inhibited the expression of its functionally related gene targets (Figure 2D, Supporting Figures 4–5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s001">Text S1</xref>) in the “prioritized HNSCC PPIN” and lead to the reduced adhesion, migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g004">Figures 4A–C</xref>) and experimental lung metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g004">Figures 4D–F</xref>). Further, the strong association of overexpression of functional miR-204 gene targets with an earlier relapse in a sub-type of HNSCC tumors expressing an EGFR-pathway signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g005">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that miR-204 expression and its deregulated gene targets could be potentially used for mechanism-based prognostic stratification of HNSCC patients to complement the conventional clinical-pathological tumor diagnosis. In fact, the feasibility of employing microRNA as sensitive and informative biomarkers for molecular diagnosis has recently been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Wang1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings show that single protein network modeling and statistical functional enrichment of a PPIN can illuminate altered complex biological processes and regulatory pathways associated with microRNA dysfunction in cancer with high precision. Complementary approaches have been developed to analyze gene expression changes in the molecular and biological context for candidate gene prioritization and for deriving mechanistic understandings that are most relevant to cancer biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Tomlins1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Wang2">[64]</xref>. The system's properties and microRNA-regulated molecular networks we discovered could be exploited for the design of “network mechanism”-based therapies to specifically restore tumor suppressor microRNA functions as an alternative to the single-gene target paradigm and merits further investigation.</p>

<p>The protein-protein interaction network (<bold>PPIN</bold>) was generated by integrating seven protein interactions and signaling datasets.

<title>Conservative permutation re-sampling of the PPIN</title>
<p>Permuted PPIN networks were generated using a link randomization approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Farkas1">[80]</xref>. Proteins are considered as nodes, and interactions between proteins are links. Since biological networks are scale free rather than random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Barabasi1">[81]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Jeong1">[82]</xref>, link-randomization can create conservative “permuted networks” as controls, from which we can derive an empirical distribution of interactions between a subset of proteins. Furthermore, our implementation of a link-randomization conserves the number of “connections” of each protein (node-degree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Barabasi1">[81]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Barabasi2">[83]</xref>). Thus the scale free properties of the original distribution are preserved in every permutation as well as the node degree of each specific protein, while the interactions (links) between these proteins vary. Self- interactions, such as those formed by homomultimers, were ignored to avoid introducing bias into the network. Duplicate protein interaction pairs were also excluded in the permutation. 10,000 of these permuted networks were generated from the original amalgamated interaction network consisting of real datasets.</p>

<title>Single Protein Network Modeling and Prioritized HNSCC PPIN (Figure 3 and Tables 11–12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>)</title>
<p>Additionally, we developed a model that estimates the probability of occurrence of an observed Single Protein Network arising from the upregulated gene list between HNSCC and normal paired tissue in GSE6631. Each of these unregulated HNSCC gene was translated to its corresponding protein identifier in the network (HNSCC protein). Each HNSCC protein was mapped to each of the rest HNSCC proteins according to existing pairs of protein interactions in the original PPIN yielding an Observed number of distinct <underline>P</underline>rotein <underline>I</underline>nteractions (Observed count of PI). Thereafter, the same procedure was applied to the 10,000 permuted PPINs yielding control counts of distinct protein <underline>i</underline>nteractions for each of the UG (Control count of PI). Since each HNSCC protein had a constant node degree in each permutation (see the previous paragraph), this procedure controlled properly for HNSCC proteins having more protein interactions than others thus providing no statistical advantage to those better connected proteins (such as hub or bottleneck proteins). For each HNSCC protein, a <italic>P-value</italic> was assigned by measuring the frequency at which the “Observed count of PI” of that HNSCC protein occurred in the empirical distribution of 10,000 “Control count of PI” for these specific HNSCC proteins (Table 11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>). Each HNSCC proteins were subsequently ranked according to its <italic>P-value</italic>. At each cutoff <italic>P-value</italic>, a certain number of HNSCC proteins were prioritized. Consequently, a FDR of the prioritized HNSCC proteins (FDR of prioritized proteins) was calculated by dividing the median number of proteins prioritized at that cutoff in the empirical distributions of permuted PPINs divided by the observed number of prioritized HNSCC proteins in the real PPIN. We refer to this approach as single protein analysis in the network (SPAN).</p>
<p>A similar procedure was developed to calculate the FDR over a pair of protein interactors among the observed prioritized HNSCC proteins (FDR of links). A “Prioritized HNSCC PPIN” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3</xref>) was predicted from SPAN in the “genome-scale PPIN” with a FDR of 7.14% for the links between labeled genes and of 10.15% for upregulated HNSCC genes in GSE6631. The resulting network was drawn using Cytoscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Shannon1">[84]</xref>. Details on the protein interaction dataset supporting each pair of protein interactions are provided in Table 12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000730.s002">Text S2</xref>. Hubs in the PPIN are defined as the top 20% of proteins' node degree (grey nodes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, the bottlenecks (grey nodes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) are defined as proteins are the top 20% betweenness score calculated using the “betweenness.c” program we developed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gersteinlab.org/proj/bottleneck/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gersteinlab.org/proj/bottleneck/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000730-Yu1">[30]</xref>. 10.4% of the PPIN proteins were observed to have both hub and bottleneck properties.

<title>Enrichment of Hub and Bottleneck Proteins in the HNSCC PPIN associated with microRNA targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000730-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>)</title>
<p>To determine whether microRNA targets in the HNSCC PPIN exhibit the genome-wide systems' properties of “hub” and “bottleneck” and their enrichment, we calculated the proportion of hub and of bottleneck proteins among microRNA targets present in the HNSCC PPIN for each microRNAs in the miRNOME. Thereafter, we conducted a non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test comparing this frequency with the theoretic expectation that derives from a random draw (as defined in the previous paragraph: 20%).</p>
<p>Using the miRNOME, we also calculated the number of distinct microRNAs that could potentially target the genes encoding for each protein of the PPIN. We subsequently obtained enrichment statistics of the hub and bottleneck properties related to microRNA regulation by comparing the count of microRNAs between hub proteins and non-hub proteins, between bottleneck and non-bottleneck proteins, as well as between hub-bottleneck and non hub-bottleneck proteins using the non-parametric Mann Whitney test.
