<p>Rabconnectin-3α and the control of puberty Human genetics shows that low levels of rabconnectin-3α cause a loss of the neurons that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone, revealing a new mechanism for incomplete puberty and infertility.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Characterization of the genetic defects causing gonadotropic deficiency has made a major contribution to elucidation of the fundamental role of Kisspeptins and Neurokinin B in puberty onset and reproduction. The absence of puberty may also reveal neurodevelopmental disorders caused by molecular defects in various cellular pathways. Investigations of these neurodevelopmental disorders may provide information about the neuronal processes controlling puberty onset and reproductive capacity. We describe here a new syndrome observed in three brothers, which involves gonadotropic axis deficiency, central hypothyroidism, peripheral demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy, mental retardation, and profound hypoglycemia, progressing to nonautoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. High-throughput sequencing revealed a homozygous in-frame deletion of 15 nucleotides in <italic>DMXL2</italic> in all three affected patients. This homozygous deletion was associated with lower <italic>DMXL2</italic> mRNA levels in the blood lymphocytes of the patients. <italic>DMXL2</italic> encodes the synaptic protein rabconnectin-3α, which has been identified as a putative scaffold protein for Rab3-GAP and Rab3-GEP, two regulators of the GTPase Rab3a. We found that rabconnectin-3α was expressed in exocytosis vesicles in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) axonal extremities in the median eminence of the hypothalamus. It was also specifically expressed in cells expressing luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) within the pituitary. The conditional heterozygous deletion of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> from mouse neurons delayed puberty and resulted in very low fertility. This reproductive phenotype was associated with a lower number of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus of adult mice. Finally, <italic>Dmxl2</italic> knockdown in an insulin-secreting cell line showed that rabconnectin-3α controlled the constitutive and glucose-induced secretion of insulin. In conclusion, this study shows that low levels of DMXL2 expression cause a complex neurological phenotype, with abnormal glucose metabolism and gonadotropic axis deficiency due to a loss of GnRH neurons. Our findings identify rabconectin-3α as a key controller of neuronal and endocrine homeostatic processes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Investigation of neurodevelopmental disorders with abnormal puberty can reveal neuronal processes that control the initiation of puberty and subsequent reproductive function. We describe here a new syndrome observed in three brothers with incomplete puberty, central hypothyroidism, peripheral polyneuropathy, mental retardation, and abnormal glucose regulation. Molecular genetic investigation in this consanguineous family revealed an in-frame deletion of 15 nucleotides in the <italic>DMXL2</italic> gene, which resulted in lower levels of its expression. We found that rabconnectin-3α, the synaptic protein encoded by <italic>DMXL2</italic>, is widely expressed in the brain and in the ends of the axons of neurons that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). We then observed that neuron-specific deletion of one allele of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> in mice reproduces the incomplete puberty seen in the human patients and results in decreased numbers of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus. We also showed that rabconnectin-3α controls glucose-induced insulin secretion. These findings reveal a new mechanism of gonadotropin deficiency and identify rabconnectin-3α as a key controller of neuronal and endocrine homeostasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Puberty is defined by the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics and the maturation of reproductive function. It is driven by an increase in sexual steroid hormone synthesis by the gonads, under the control of the hypothalamo–pituitary hormonal axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Sisk1">[1]</xref>. The key event in puberty initiation is an increase in the pulsatile release of GnRH by hypothalamic neurons, triggering the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Plant1">[2]</xref>. This pubertal increase in GnRH secretion is associated with increases in glutamatergic inputs and decreases in GABAergic inputs to GnRH neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Iremonger1">[3]</xref>. It is also facilitated by hypothalamic glial cells, which interact directly or indirectly with GnRH neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Ojeda1">[4]</xref>. Kisspeptins (KPs) are currently thought to be the principal hypothalamic neuropeptides controlling GnRH secretion in mammals, not only at puberty but also during adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Pinilla1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Goodman1">[6]</xref>. The activation of the KP signaling pathway in the hypothalamus is seen as the major hallmark of puberty onset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Pinilla1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Goodman1">[6]</xref>, and its control is partly epigenetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Lomniczi1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a medical condition defined by a defect of the hypothalamo–pituitary–gonadotropic (HPG) axis resulting in an absence of puberty and infertility in adulthood. Characterization of the genetic defects underlying the isolated form of CHH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-deRoux1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Topaloglu2">[12]</xref> has proved crucial, not only for elucidating the fundamental role of KPs in the central regulation of the gonadotropic axis and puberty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Pinilla1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Goodman1">[6]</xref> but also for determining the role played by Neurokinin B (NKB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Navarro1">[13]</xref>. CHH may be associated with anosmia, due to olfactory bulb agenesis, in Kallmann syndrome (KS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Dode1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Pitteloud1">[15]</xref>. In KS, GnRH neurons fail to leave the olfactory placode (OP). Indeed, GnRH neurons, unlike other neurons of the CNS, migrate early in embryogenesis, from the OP into the hypothalamus, along the olfactory tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Wray1">[16]</xref>. All genes linked to KS encode proteins necessary for olfactory bulb development or for the migration and maturation of GnRH neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Pitteloud1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>CHH has also been described in highly complex neurodevelopmental disorders caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in diverse cellular pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Alazami1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Tetreault1">[21]</xref>. This association indicates that the same etiopathogenic mechanism may be responsible for a specific neuroendocrine deficiency and common neurological dysfunctions. We recently decided to investigate these common mechanisms further, by characterizing the molecular mechanism of a new syndrome that associates GnRH deficiency with complex neurological and endocrine phenotypes. A genetic analysis of this family revealed that this phenotype was due to a weak expression of <italic>DMXL2</italic>, encoding Rabconnectin-3α. Through in vivo and in vitro analysis of rabconnectin-3α expression and function, we discovered that weak <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression in the adult mouse brain resulted in a loss of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus. These findings established a novel molecular mechanism leading to gonadotropic axis deficiency and paved the way for improvements in our understanding of the neuroendocrine control of reproduction.</p>

<title>Phenotype</title>
<p>We investigated a consanguineous Senegalese family with five children, three of whom had an unusual, progressive endocrine and neurodevelopmental disorder, with similar clinical features in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001952-t001">Table 1</xref>). This syndrome began early in childhood, with growth retardation and recurrent episodes of profound asymptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose concentration as low as 1.6 mmol/l), with an incomplete suppression of insulin concentrations (2 to 4 mIU/l), appearing between the ages of 2 and 5 ys. Between the ages of 14 and 16 y, the three brothers gradually developed progressive nonautoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Their puberty was incomplete and they had a low testicular volume. All the brothers had a normal sense of smell. During adolescence, the brothers had walking difficulties, such as ataxia and dysarthria. Neurological examination showed polyneuropathy, with a motor deficit predominantly affecting the proximal lower limbs, pes cavus, and claw toes, together with cerebellar and pyramidal signs. Electrophysiological patterns were consistent with a demyelinating polyneuropathy, with a diffuse homogeneous pattern of slowing motor conduction in peripheral nerves (23–42 m/s; N&gt;50 m/s) and greater preservation of sensory conduction in the legs than in the arms. Brain MRI showed moderate subcortical temporal white matter disease, and one patient (no. 123) also had mild hypoplasia of the cerebellum and a small anterior pituitary. The posterior lobe of the pituitary was in the correct position.</p>

<p>Hormonal assays in adulthood showed an increase in HbA1c levels to up to 11.7%, with low insulin concentrations in an intravenous glucose tolerance test and subnormal basal C-peptide secretion; serum-free T4 concentrations were low, with normal TSH concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001952-t002">Table 2</xref>). The effects of TRH administration indicated that this central hypothyroidism was probably of hypothalamic origin. All three brothers had low plasma testosterone concentrations for their age, along with low LH and FSH concentrations. A GnRH test (100 µg i.v.) was performed in two patients (nos. 123 and 124 at 21 and 20 y of age, respectively). It revealed a large increase in LH concentrations associated with a normal increase in FSH concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001952-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of the <italic>DMXL2</italic> Mutation</title>
<p>Assuming a fully penetrant recessive transmission model with a disease allele frequency of 0.00001, two candidate regions were identified on chromosomes 13 and 15, with a LOD score of 2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These two regions harbored 164 and 341 genes. High-throughput sequencing of all exons of both candidate regions in the DNA of the proband and his mother revealed an in-frame deletion of 15 nucleotides (c.5824_5838del) in exon 24 of <italic>DMXL2</italic>, which encodes rabconnectin-3α (Rbcn-3α) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This deletion results in the deletion of five amino-acid residues SDGNG (p.1942_1946del) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Both parents and one unaffected sister were heterozygous for the deletion; one unaffected sister did not carry the deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This pattern of familial segregation is consistent with recessive transmission. The Ser1942 residue is highly conserved between species, whereas the other four residues are not well conserved. We suspected that the 15-nucleotide deletion in <italic>DMXL2</italic> might modify the level of expression of this gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Houseley1">[22]</xref>. In fact, quantitative RT-PCR showed that there was significantly less <italic>DMXL2</italic> mRNA in homozygous c.5824_5838del patients than in heterozygous or wild-type (WT) family members and unrelated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggested that the c.5824_5838del probably exerted its pathogenic effects by decreasing the expression of <italic>DMXL2</italic>. We tested this hypothesis by searching for <italic>DMXL2</italic> mutations in 10 cases of HH with a similar phenotype. No <italic>DMXL2</italic> mutation was found in any of these patients. We therefore carried out studies in rodents, to confirm the link between the decrease in <italic>DMXL2</italic> expression and the phenotype.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> and Rbcn-3α in Rodent Brain and Pituitary</title>
<p>Rbcn-3α is a synaptic protein that interacts closely with WDR7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Kawabe1">[23]</xref> and may serve as a scaffold protein for both Rab3-GEP and Rab3-GAP on synaptic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Kawabe1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Nagano1">[24]</xref>. Rbcn-3α has also been implicated in the regulation of Notch signaling, through the modulation of v-ATPAse activity in mammalian and insect cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Sethi1">[25]</xref>. We therefore analyzed the expression of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> and Rbcn-3α in both the brain and pituitary in rodents. Both <italic>Dmxl2</italic> mRNA and Rbcn-3α were detected in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, hypothalamus, pyriform cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g002">Figure 2A–E</xref>), and the granular and molecular layers of the cerebellum of adult mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In the hypothalamus, immunostaining for Rbcn-3α was observed in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), the median eminence (ME), the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>), and the subfornical organ (SFO), the subcommissural organ, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The external layer of the ME displayed a punctate pattern of immunostaining for Rbcn-3α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g003">Figure 2E</xref>). Staining was also observed in the cell bodies lining the third ventricle and in the long processes extending from these cell bodies toward the external layer of the ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Rbcn-3α was detected in small clear vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) and in large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). This pattern of staining strongly suggests that both tanycytes and hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons express Rbcn-3α. In the anterior pituitary of adult rats, Rbcn-3α immunostaining was observed only in cells producing LH and FSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), the pattern observed being similar to that for Rab3-GEP and Rab3-GAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>In Vivo Investigation of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> Deletion in Mice</title>
<p>We then investigated whether a decrease in <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression in mice could reproduce the phenotype observed in the human patients. For this purpose, we used a targeted gene-trapping vector to delete <italic>Dmxl2</italic> in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Skarnes1">[26]</xref>. In this strategy, the recombinant allele (tm1a) contained an IRES:LacZ trapping cassette and a floxed promoter-driven neo cassette in intron 6 and two loxP sites, one at either end of exon 7 of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The tm1a allele encodes a truncated form of Rbcn-3α. <italic>Dmxl2</italic>-heterozygous hypomorphic mice (<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>tm1a/wt</sup>) displayed no obvious morphological, growth deficit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s008">Table S1</xref>). <italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>tm1a/wt</sup> mice were fertile. A tendency for a slightly later vaginal opening (VO), an important external indicator of puberty onset, and a longer time between VO and first estrus, were observed in <italic>Dmxl2<sup>tm1a/wt</sup></italic> mice, but these differences were not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Although fertile, these mice produced no homozygous offspring (<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup>) when crossed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s009">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>As the gene-trapping method may generate a hypomorphic allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Skarnes2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Guan1">[28]</xref> and we expected the severity of the phenotype to be correlated with <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression levels in neurons, we investigated whether a mouse line with a complete KO of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> in neurons had a more severe phenotype. We crossed <italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>tm1a/wt</sup> mice with WT mice expressing the FLIP (flp) recombinase, which recognizes the FLP recombinase target (FRT) sequence flanking the β-galactosidase-neomycin cassette in the tm1a allele. This led to the production of mice bearing two WT alleles, with two loxP sites flanking exon 7 of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> (<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>). These <italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice were then crossed with mice expressing the Cre-recombinase under the control of the Nestin promoter (<italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Dubois1">[29]</xref>, to obtain mice bearing a <italic>Dmxl2</italic> allele from which exon 7 was deleted in nestin-expressing cells (<italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

<p>The normal concentrations of LH observed despite the low concentration of testosterone in male <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice was indicative of a partial CHH due to a hypothalamic defect. Consistent with this, <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice displayed normal increases in LH concentration following the intraperitoneal injection of GnRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). The normal response to PMSG injection of ovaries from <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice confirmed that the very low rate of ovulation in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> females was related to a defect in the hypothalamo–pituitary control of the gonadotropic axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). The delayed puberty and infertility observed in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice was therefore due largely to a hypothalamic defect.</p>
<p>We characterized the hypothalamic defect in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice, by determining whether Rbcn-3α was produced in GnRH neurons. Punctate Rbcn-3α staining was colocalized with GnRH in the median and external layers of the ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Electron microscopy confirmed that Rbcn-3α was present in GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We investigated whether the gonadotropin deficiency observed in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice was due to GnRH deficiency, by quantifying GnRH mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice and comparing them with those of WT mice. GnRH mRNA levels were significantly lower in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This decrease was specific to GnRH, as the amounts of mRNA for other hypothalamic-releasing hormones were normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001952.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The lower levels of GnRH mRNA were associated with the presence of fewer GnRH-ir neurons in the hypothalamus of <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice than in WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). An analysis of the rostral–caudal distribution of GnRH-ir neurons from the diagonal band of Broca to the ME showed that there were significantly fewer GnRH-ir neurons in the OVLT, this loss of neurons not being compensated by an increase in the number of GnRH-immunoreactive (GnRH-ir) neurons in the rostral or caudal parts of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g006">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>). The poor fertility observed in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice was therefore associated with the presence of fewer GnRH-ir neurons in the hypothalamus.</p>

<title>Rbcn-3α Is Involved in the Regulated Secretion of Insulin</title>
<p>Severe abnormal glucoregulation, consistent with impaired insulin secretion, was observed in the three affected brothers. Rbcn-3α forms a complex with regulators of Rab3 GTPase, and this complex is involved in the docking and priming of exocytosis vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Hutagalung1">[31]</xref>. Insulin-secreting pancreatic islet β cells express many proteins involved in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Burgoyne1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Jacobsson1">[33]</xref>. In fact, Rbcn-3α was found to be present in pancreatic β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that Rbcn-3α might be involved in the regulated secretion of insulin. We tested this hypothesis, by using siRNA to down-regulate <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression in an insulin-secreting cell line (INS-1E). We observed a significant decrease in <italic>Dmxl2</italic> mRNA levels, to 25% those in nontarget (NT) siRNA-transfected cells, 72 h after the transfection of INS-1E cells with the <italic>Dmxl2</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression with <italic>Dmxl2</italic> siRNA resulted in significantly higher levels of basal insulin secretion than for NT siRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). By contrast to what was observed for NT siRNA-transfected cells, the incubation of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> siRNA-transfected cells with 5 mM glucose did not increase insulin secretion, and only a slight increase in insulin secretion was observed after incubation with 20 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). These in vitro experiments demonstrate the involvement of Rbcn-3α in the control of regulated insulin secretion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that a low level of <italic>DMXL2</italic> haploinsufficiency caused a previously unknown complex phenotype in humans. The Warburg Micro and Martsolf syndromes were considered the most relevant syndromes for comparison with the phenotype reported here, as these syndromes are caused by mutations affecting the catalytic (<italic>RAB3GAP1</italic>, p130) and noncatalytic subunits (<italic>RAB3GAP2</italic>, p150) of RAB3GAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Aligianis1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Aligianis2">[19]</xref>, two components of the protein complex containing Rbcn-3α. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, mental retardation, and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients with <italic>RAB3GAP1</italic> or <italic>RAB3GAP2</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Handley1">[34]</xref>, but the bilateral cataracts, microphthalmia, and microcornea systematically found in patients with the Warburg Micro and Martsolf syndromes were not observed in this family. Furthermore, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has not been reported in these syndromes. The phenotype observed in this family was therefore different from those of the Warburg Micro and Martsolf syndromes.</p>
<p>Mice expressing a conditional heterozygous null allele of <italic>Dmlx2</italic> in neurons have very low fertility. This finding contrasts with the observed phenotype of mice expressing a hypomorphic <italic>Dmxl2</italic> allele and with findings for the family studied here, in which the two c.5824_5838del-heterozygous parents were clearly fertile. We suspect that the severity of the phenotype is highly associated to the neuronal expression level of <italic>Dmxl2</italic>. The level of Rbcn-3α expression in the neurons of <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice was found to be 50% that in WT animals, whereas <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression in the neurons of <italic>Dmxl2<sup>tm1a/wt</sup></italic> mice was thought to be more than 50% that observed in WT mice. <italic>DMXL2</italic> mRNA levels were about 30% normal values in subjects homozygous for c.5824_5838del, whereas they were about 60% normal values in subjects heterozygous for this deletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001952-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, we were unable to obtain viable <italic>Dmxl2<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice. These mice died during embryonic development, indicating a requirement of Rbcn-3α for normal development in mice. This correlation between <italic>DMXL2</italic> expression level and the severity of the neurological and neuroendocrinological phenotypes in both mice and humans is consistent with a probable synaptic function for Rbcn-3α. The phenotypic discrepancy between mice and humans may also result from the interactions of different partners with Rbcn-3α. It may also reflect the fact that the threshold of the neuronal expression level of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> causing a phenotype may be species-specific.</p>
<p>An investigation of gonadotropic axis function in adult <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice showed that the partial gonadotropic deficiency was associated with the presence of a smaller total number of GnRH-ir neurons. Multiple mechanisms may be involved, such as a defect of GnRH neuron differentiation in the OP, migratory failure, or a defect in the maturation and postnatal survival of these GnRH neurons. The latter follow a unique migratory route, emerging in the OP at E10.5 and then entering the forebrain at E.13.5, to migrate along olfactory/vomeronasal nerve axons before turning toward the hypothalamus, where they are dispersed in the preoptic area (POA) and extend their axons by E16.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Wierman1">[35]</xref>. Many of the factors controlling GnRH neuron migration also influence or control the development of the olfactory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Wierman1">[35]</xref>. Olfactory bulbs developed normally in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice, demonstrating that the smaller number of GnRH neurons in the POA region of <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> adult mice was not associated with a defect of olfactory/vomeronasal nerve axon development. This result is consistent with the absence of anosmia and olfactory bulb agenesis in the patients with <italic>DMXL2</italic> mutations. Furthermore, the analysis in adult mice showed that the migration of GnRH neurons was not halted in the forebrain. Preliminary data suggested that adult nes-Cre;Dmxl2<sup>–/wt</sup> mice had a GnRH neuron morphology in the rostral POA that was more complex than the normal unipolar/bipolar morphology displayed by their WT littermates. This region contains the GnRH neuron population of the greatest importance for the onset of puberty and fertility. This complex morphology may indicate that GnRH neurons did not progress toward a mature form. This led us to suspect that there might be a defect in the postnatal development of GnRH neurons in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice. It is interesting to note that Rbcn-3α was recently shown to be required for neural crest cell migration and cell fate determination by controlling the Wnt signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Tuttle1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>The observation that siRNA-induced down-regulation of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression led to an increase in spontaneous insulin release and a disruption of glucose-induced insulin release in INS-1E cells is consistent with a role for Rbcn-3α in controlling the secretion of insulin in vivo. The episodes of hypoglycemia during childhood in the human patients, associated with the lack of a blockade of insulin release, may be accounted by a decrease in the inhibition of basal insulin release by Rbcn-3α. By contrast, the occurrence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus during adolescence in the affected patients indicates an inability of the pancreas to respond to the increase in insulin requirement at puberty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Carel1">[37]</xref>. This role of Rbcn-3α in controlling insulin release is consistent with the recent report of an association between the MAP kinase-activating death domain (MADD) protein locus, also known as RAB3GEP, with fasting glycemia and plasma proinsulin concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Huyghe1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Dupuis1">[39]</xref>. Rab27a is a monomeric GTPase protein very similar to Rab3. Rab27a mediates glucose-specific signals for the exocytosis of insulin vesicles in the pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Izumi1">[40]</xref>. Further investigations are required to confirm the role of Rbcn-3α in insulin release in vivo and to determine whether this protein may also act via the Rab27 pathway.</p>
<p>As the cellular machinery controlling vesicle exocytosis is similar in pancreatic β cells and neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Burgoyne1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Jacobsson1">[33]</xref>, we can assume that Rbcn-3α is involved in neurosecretion. Rbcn-3α may exert its neurosecretory functions by controlling the “on/off” activity of Rab3a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Geppert1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Sakane1">[42]</xref>. However, the severity of the phenotypes observed in this family and in patients with <italic>RAB3GAP1</italic> and <italic>RAB3GAP2</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Aligianis1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Aligianis2">[19]</xref> contrast with the mild deficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release caused by <italic>Rab3a</italic> deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Geppert2">[43]</xref>. Other vesicle exocytosis steps may thus be impaired when <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression levels are low in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Figueiredo1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Yan1">[46]</xref>. The neurotransmitter glutamate is involved in the regulation of GnRH secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Iremonger1">[3]</xref>. Glutamate release is controlled by the amount of active Rab3a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Sakane1">[42]</xref>, suggesting that glutamate-induced GnRH neuron activation may be impaired in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice. This possible dysfunction of the glutamatergic input in GnRH neurons may be responsible for the loss of GnRH neurons in <italic>nes-Cre</italic>;<italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup>–/wt</sup> mice. Defective V-ATPase–mediated acidification of exocytosis vesicles may also contribute to the phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Einhorn1">[47]</xref>. The expression of Rbcn-3α, Rab3-GEP, and Rab3-GAP in gonadotropes only suggests that these three proteins may specifically regulate the secretion of LH and FSH. A dual defect in hypothalamic neuropeptide and gonadotropin secretion may thus contribute to the gonadotropic axis deficiency observed in the studied family.</p>
<p>We found in this study that low levels of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression caused a complex neurological and endocrine phenotype in humans. Low levels of <italic>Dmxl2</italic> expression in neuronal cells of mice lead to a partial gonadotropic axis deficiency, resulting in a very low fertility, due to a loss of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus. Our results strongly suggest that the loss of these neurons is due to a dysfunction of peptide/neurotransmitter release by GnRH neurons itself or the neurons innervating GnRH neurons. This association of a low level of expression of a vesicular protein and the loss of GnRH neurons constitutes a new mechanism of GnRH deficiency. This study opens up new possibilities for characterizing the pathogenic mechanisms of GnRH deficiency and the neuronal control of the GnRH network.</p>

<p>For double-labeling fluorescent IHC, sections were first rinsed in PBS and preincubated for 30 min in 5% NDS in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were coincubated overnight at RT in ADD AbIs diluted in PBS containing 1% NDS and 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and incubated for 1 h in GIVE THE AbIIs Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1∶200; Molecular Probes) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1∶300; Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in PBS containing 3% NDS and 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were then rinsed in PBS, counterstained with DAPI (1/4,000), mounted on glass slides, and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G solution (Southern Biotech) for confocal microscopic examination.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescent sections were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal scanning system (Leica Microsystems) equipped with 488-nm Ar, 561-nm DPSS, and 633-nm HeNe lasers. Eight bit digital images were collected from a single optical plane using a 63× HC PL APO CS2 oil-immersion Leica objective (numerical aperture, 1.40) or a 40× HC PL APO CS2 oil-immersion Leica objective (numerical aperture, 1.30). For each optical section, double/triple-labelled images were acquired in sequential mode to avoid potential contamination by linkage-specific fluorescence emission cross-talk.</p>

<p>C57BL6 WT adult mice (PND 60) were anesthetized with 0.2 cm<sup>3</sup> of 10% chloral hydrate and intracardially perfused with 100 ml of 4% PFA, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) on ice. Brains were postfixed by overnight incubation in 4% PFA at 4°C. The following day, the hypothalamus was dissected and cut into 200-µm sections in ice-cold PBS. These sections were then processed for pre-embedding IHC with an antibody against rabconnectin-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001952-Dumoulin1">[54]</xref>. For this purpose, sections were immersed for 20 min in 50 mM ammonium chloride in PBS, rinsed, and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti–rabconnectin-3α antibody (1∶500) in PBS containing 0.1% gelatin (PBSg). Antibody binding was detected by incubating sections with a goat anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody (1∶200) in PBS-gelatin for 4 h at RT and then with an avidin–peroxidase complex (1∶200) for 3 h (Elite Vectastain kit, Vector Laboratories). Finally, sections were incubated with 0.6% diaminobenzidine in Tris-buffered saline and then with Sigma Fast DAB. After staining, the region of interest, the ME, was further dissected and embedded in epoxy resin, for the cutting of semithin sections (0.5 µm), which were stained for visualization of the ME. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) of the ME were then cut and collected on 400-mesh formvar-coated nickel grids and examined with a Jeol JEM-100CXII electron microscope.</p>
<p>For dual labeling with Rbcn-3α and GnRH antibodies, the ME was carefully dissected out, rinsed in PBS, and incubated in 20% glycerol/20% sucrose in PBS for 3 h. ME sections were then placed carefully in liquid nitrogen for three freeze cycles, rinsed in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and washed in PBSg. ME sections were incubated overnight in mouse anti-GnRH antibody, at a dilution of 1∶200 in PBSg, at 4°C. The sections were then washed in PBSg, incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to gold particles (Aurion, Biovalley), at a dilution of 1∶100, for 4 h at RT (nanogold). Sections were washed in PBS. The nanogold particle signal was amplified with a BBI Amplification silver kit, for 7 min at RT, followed by gold toning. The sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti–Rbcn-3α, at a dilution of 1∶500 in PBSg. Rbcn-3α staining was detected by incubating the sections with donkey anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody at a dilution of 1∶200 in PBSg at RT, rinsing in PBS, and then incubating with an avidin–biotin complex at a dilution of 1∶200, with the detection of DAB staining after postfixation (1% glutaraldehyde) with SigmaFast tablets (Sigma Aldrich). The DAB reaction was stopped with Tris-HCL, and the sections were washed in PBS. Sections were incubated with osmium tetraoxide for 1 h at 4°C and dehydrated for embedding in epoxy resin, flat embedding, and polymerization. Sections embedded in epoxy resin blocks were subsequently cut into semithin (0.5–2 µm) and ultrathin (70 nm) sections and analyzed by electron microscopy.</p>

Extracts of Sanger sequencing chromatograms for exon 24 of <italic>DMXL2</italic> for one affected patient (#123), one heterozygous parent (#121), and one WT sister (#127). Primer sequences are available upon request. The in-frame deleted region in exon 24 is underlined in the chromatogram of patient #127. <italic>DMXL2</italic> was identified as an interesting candidate gene by the next-generation sequencing of two candidate regions delineated by genome mapping. All exons of these two regions were captured from the proband DNA and his mother DNA and sequenced with the 454 sequencing system. We found 3,295 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the two DNA samples, 2,015 of which were common to the proband and his mother. Among these 2,015 SNPs, 1,612 had previously been reported in HapMap and dbSNP. Of the 403 unknown SNPs in these two databases, 91 were present in mRNAs, but only 20 were present in coding sequences. Six of these variants were considered to be of interest.

Applying the criteria described above, none of the DNA variants found on chromosome 13 were considered valid candidates. This left only one potentially interesting variant in <italic>DMXL2</italic> on chromosome 15. This DNA variant was an in-frame deletion of 15 nucleotides (c.5824_5838del) in exon 24, leading to a deletion of five amino-acid residues from the protein (p.1942_1946del).
