<p>α-Actinin is an actin crosslinking molecule that can serve as a scaffold and maintain dynamic actin filament networks. As a crosslinker in the stressed cytoskeleton, α-actinin can retain conformation, function, and strength. α-Actinin has an actin binding domain and a calmodulin homology domain separated by a long rod domain. Using molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis, we suggest that the α-actinin rod domain has flexible terminal regions which can twist and extend under mechanical stress, yet has a highly rigid interior region stabilized by aromatic packing within each spectrin repeat, by electrostatic interactions between the spectrin repeats, and by strong salt bridges between its two anti-parallel monomers. By exploring the natural vibrations of the α-actinin rod domain and by conducting bending molecular dynamics simulations we also predict that bending of the rod domain is possible with minimal force. We introduce computational methods for analyzing the torsional strain of molecules using rotating constraints. Molecular dynamics extension of the α-actinin rod is also performed, demonstrating transduction of the unfolding forces across salt bridges to the associated monomer of the α-actinin rod domain.</p>

<p>The cell interacts with its environment in both biochemical and mechanical ways. In this study we explore one of the ways in which the cell interacts mechanically with its environment. α-Actinin is a cytoskeletal crosslinker: it functions to scaffold the cytoskeletal actin filaments that provide mechanical reinforcement to the cell. In its functional environment α-actinin is exposed to a multitude of mechanical stresses as it attaches itself to a dynamic network of actin filaments. The actin filaments extend, rotate, and bend the α-actinin crosslinkers. In this study we employ molecular dynamics techniques to understand the structural characteristics of α-actinin that underlie its ability to provide a scaffold in such a stressed environment. We analyzed the natural frequencies of α-actinin and simulated force-induced bending, extension, and twisting. Our results suggest that α-actinin has structural flexibility facilitating crosslinking in a dynamic environment and also structural rigidity stabilizing the linkage in the stressed environment. We have discovered novel natural bending movements of the rod domain that enhance its function as a crosslinker. We have also demonstrated the specific structural characteristics of α-actinin that give it the previously suggested property of having partial flexibility. Our results enhance the understanding of structural mechanics in the cytoskeletal molecules.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cytoskeletal microfilament networks contribute to the mechanical stability of the cell by dynamically arranging and rearranging actin filaments for reinforcement. The dynamic arrangement of actin filament requires actin filament crosslinking molecules such as α-actinin. α-Actinin is a 200 kDa homodimer with three major structural motifs: the actin binding domain (ABD), the calmodulin homology domain (Cam), and the central rod domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Sjoblom1">[1]</xref>. Each monomer contains all three structural domains but the two monomers are arranged anti-parallel so that the two ABDs are at opposite ends of α-actinin. The arrangement of the two ABDs at opposite ends allows for α-actinin to crosslink parallel actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Blanchard1">[2]</xref>. Actin filaments in the parallel arrangement are very dynamic; the actin filaments move laterally and horizontally in relationship to each other, and continuously bind and unbind α-actinin crosslinking molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Fraley1">[3]</xref>. Several cellular processes involving actin filament dynamic rearrangement and scaffolding by α-actinin include: focal adhesion formation near membrane bound integrin molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Zhang1">[4]</xref>, cytokinesis and cytoplasmic dumping in the final stages of mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Mukhina1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Reichl1">[6]</xref>, and z-disk formation and stabilization in muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Young1">[7]</xref>. In order for α-actinin to maintain its function as an actin filament scaffold in such a dynamic environment, the α-actinin molecule must be partially flexible, meaning it must simultaneously be rigid and stable at some regions to resist external stress and be flexible at other regions to maintain binding in a dynamic environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-DjinovicCarugo1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Mofrad1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Structure of the α-actinin rod domain underlies the function of α-actinin as a partially flexible actin filament crosslinker. Each central rod domain monomer is 240 Å long and made up of 4 spectrin (R1–R4) repeats connected by helical linkers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Broderick1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Kusunoki1">[12]</xref>. Other molecules with spectrin repeats include dystophin and utrophin. The α-actinin rod domain differs from the other spectrin family molecules by its shorter length, its more rigid helical linkers, and its dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Broderick2">[13]</xref>. The spectrin repeats structure of the rod domain contributes several vital characteristics to the α-actinin rod domain: aromatic packing and hydrophobic residues within each repeat stabilize secondary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-DjinovicCarugo1">[8]</xref>; acidic and basic surfaces on R1 and R4 confer strong dimerization interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Sjoblom1">[1]</xref>, Kd of 10 pM between monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Flood1">[14]</xref>; interaction of hydrophobic residues between R2 and R3 on both monomers and electrostatic interactions produce a coiled-coil homodimer conformation with a 12 degree bend and a 90 degree left handed twist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Ylanne1">[15]</xref>. Together these characteristics account for the rod domain maintaining both structural rigidity and flexibility.</p>

<p>The goal of this investigation is to understand the structural mechanisms of the partial flexibility of the α-actinin rod domain. The coiled-coil nature of the rod domain is an essential component of the rod domain structure. Coiled-coils are the dominant conformation for fibrous proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Lupas1">[16]</xref>. Most coiled-coils have a heptad conformation, with hydrophobic residues every seventh residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Burkhard1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Wolf1">[18]</xref>. The heptad conformation allows for hydrophobic insertion of one linker region into that of the other monomers by a knobs-into-holes mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Crick1">[19]</xref>. The presence of heptad hydrophobic residues is common in coiled-coil structure but neither necessary nor sufficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Burkhard1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Wolf1">[18]</xref>. Coiled-coils with antiparallel dimers like the α-actinin rod domain are stabilized mainly by electrostatic interactions between the monomers, and within the monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Oakley1">[20]</xref>. In general the knobs-into-holes mechanism of coiled-coil conformation exists only when stabilized by electrostatic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Liu1">[21]</xref>. The tendency of electrostatic interactions to play a key role in stabilizing coiled-coil dimers like α-actinin is in contrast to globular proteins, where hydrophobic, VDW, and electrostatic interactions are equally significant to molecular stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Jaenicke1">[22]</xref>. The coiled-coil conformation of the rod domain is a significant structural feature, and the significance of electrostatic interactions to coiled-coil structure stability suggests a significant role of electrostatic interactions in mechanical properties of the α-actinin rod domain.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined the mechanical properties of other molecules with rod-like coiled-coil conformations. These studies on DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Travers1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Sivolob1">[26]</xref>, myosin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Gundapaneni1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Chandran2">[29]</xref>, and keratin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Akkermans1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Danciulescu1">[31]</xref> together suggest the coiled-coil rod like structure contributes extensible rigidity and torsional and bending flexibility. The tertiary structure of DNA is referred to as coiled-coil, and more commonly as a double-helix, because it consists of two intertwined α-helices. In contrast, α-actinin and other fibrous proteins are referred to as coiled-coil due to intertwining in their quaternary structures. The difference between the DNA coiled-coil conformation and the protein coiled-coil conformation is significant, but the mechanical properties can still be compared. DNA is the most studied of the coiled-coil conformations and has been described as an elastic rod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Balaeff1">[32]</xref>. Its global mechanical behavior has been described as like a thin isotropic homogeneous rod, but its local mechanical behavior has been described as like an anisotropic heterogeneous rod with bending and torsional flexibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Travers1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Sivolob1">[26]</xref>. Myosin has an S2 region that functions as a lever arm in muscle sarcomeres. Using a single molecule assay in a total internal reflection microscopy experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Gundapaneni1">[27]</xref>, it has been shown that the S2 region has significant torsional flexibility underlying its lever arm function. Keratin, the first coiled-coil structure to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-MacArthur1">[33]</xref>, is the major molecule in hair fibers, and investigation of its mechanical behavior with molecular dynamics has shown that it has strong stretching rigidity, over 1 nN of force is needed to stretch keratin 90% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Akkermans1">[30]</xref>. Removing the electrostatic interactions underlying the coiled-coil conformation of keratin significantly reduces its rigidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Danciulescu1">[31]</xref>. These studies suggest that the coiled-coil conformation in α-actinin contributes extension rigidity but torsional and bending flexibility.</p>
<p>Studies of α-actinin and other spectrin repeat molecules have similarly demonstrated extension rigidity of the coiled-coil rod domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Law1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Zaman1">[37]</xref>. Experimental investigation using atomic force microscopy (AFM) of spectrin unfolding demonstrated that spectrin repeats unfold in a cooperative mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Rief1">[35]</xref>. Several molecular dynamics investigations further characterize the extension rigidity of the α-actinin rod domain as resulting from the strength of the helical linker between the spectrin repeats, and electrostatic and hydrogen bonding within each repeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Danciulescu1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Law1">[34]</xref>. There has been no investigation of the bending or torsional flexibility of the α-actinin rod domain or other spectrin repeats, but investigation of α-actinin structure using cryoelectron microscopy has shown that there must be some structural flexibility since α-actinin molecules form stable actin filaments crosslinks in a range of crosslinking angles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Hampton1">[38]</xref>. Is the flexibility of α-actinin in crosslinking actin filaments due to torsional and bending flexibility of the rod domain? What features of the coiled-coil structure of α-actinin underlie its partial flexibility?</p>
<p>Using molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis this study investigates the mechanical partial flexibility of the α-actinin rod domain. Bending, torsion and extension simulations demonstrate that, as with other coiled-coil molecules, the α-actinin rod domain has bending and torsional flexibility and extensional rigidity. Normal mode analysis shows that the rod-like structure of α-actinin contributes towards its bending and torsional flexibility. Our simulations suggest that aromatic packing interactions determine the trajectory of torsion on the rod domain, and that electrostatic interaction between the monomers contributes extension rigidity to the rod domain.</p>

<title>Normal Mode Analysis</title>
<p>Structural properties of α-actinin can be inferred from its natural vibrations, therefore, to reveal the naturally rigid and flexible regions of the α-actinin rod domain, we carried out normal mode analysis (NMA). Results from NMA convey properties inherent in the structure of α-actinin regardless of what intermolecular interactions are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Lu1">[39]</xref>. The purpose of our NMA is to determine the contributions of the α-actinin rod-like structure to its mechanical behavior. Later sections will investigate contributions of intermolecular interactions to its mechanical behavior. NMA was carried out on both the monomer conformation of the rod domain containing only four spectrin repeats and on the dimer conformation containing eight total spectrin repeats arranged in an anti-parallel coiled-coil conformation. The NMA results suggest the α-actinin rod domain to have natural bending and torsional flexibility.</p>
<p>NMA from a single monomer of α-actinin suggested that the monomer has significant bending flexibility and some torsional flexibility. The six lowest frequencies of α-actinin are rotational and translational modes. Mode 7 and mode 8, the two lowest frequency vibrational modes, show bending movement mainly at the termini with a single hinge at the central linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g002">Figure 2 A,B, and E</xref>). Of the other lowest frequency vibrational modes, three modes: 9, 10, and 12, exhibit bending modes with three hinge regions, each at the three linker regions between the spectrin repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g002">Figure 2 A, C, and F</xref>). A three-hinge bending movement refers to bending with three different hinges, resulting in the molecule being divided into four sections, each undergoing movement in different directions. The other lowest frequency normal mode, mode 11, exhibits torsional movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g002">Figure 2 A, D, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s005">Video S1</xref>). The torsional motion in mode 11 is localized to the regions near the termini. The α-actinin monomer NMA results suggest bending and torsion movements to be natural movements, movements that are exhibited by the natural vibrational frequencies, and reveal the residues near the termini to be more flexible and the linker residues to be more rigid.</p>

<p>NMA of the rod domain dimer suggested that the bending flexibility is retained in dimerization, while a new natural movement involving torsion and bending is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g003">Figure 3 C and F</xref>). The lowest vibrational frequency for the dimerized α-actinin rod domain (mode 7) is a single-hinge bending mode with hinge action at the central repeat as with the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g003">Figure 3 A, B, and E</xref>). The other bending modes, modes 8, 10, and 11, in the dimer also show torsional motion along with the bending motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g003">Figure 3 A, C, and F</xref>). Mode 8 showed the most pronounced bending and torsion, while modes 10 and 11 showed similar characteristics with more subtle movements. Two torsional modes exist for the dimer conformation, modes 9 and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g003">Figure 3 A, D, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s006">Video S2</xref>). The torsional movement is localized to the termini as with the NMA of the α-actinin monomer. Dimerization maintained natural vibrations of bending and torsion, and still exhibited flexibility near the termini of the α-actinin rod domain. Vibrational movement in several additional normal modes for both the monomer and dimer are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s004">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Force induced bending of α-actinin.</title>
<p>Forced bending molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using CHARMm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Brooks2">[54]</xref>. A) Total bending forces ranging from 8 to 200 pN were applied to the α-actinin rod domain monomer. Forces less than 24 pN (8 pN shown in blue and 12 pN shown in red) failed to fully bend the monomer. The rate of bending is directly proportional to the total bending force. Trajectory for total force values of 24 pN shown in green, 48 pN shown in purple, 100 pN shown in blue, and 200 pN shown in orange. Graph shows angle between two termini and the central hinge throughout the simulation. B) Bending path of the α-actinin monomer. Successive steps were superimposed on the original conformation and represented using transparent material in VMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Humphrey1">[52]</xref>. Arrows indicate the direction of bending force applied to the ends of the rod. Triangle indicates location of hinge. C) Graph showing trajectory of bending simulations on the dimer conformation of the α-actinin rod domain. Forces show as: 24 pN is blue, 48 pN is red, 100 pN is green, and 200 pN is purple. Only forces of 100 pN and 200 pN achieved total bending. D) Trajectory of bending of the dimer conformation of the α-actinin rod domain. Successive steps from the bending simulation have been superimposed using VMD. Arrows indicate the direction of bending force applied to the ends of the rod. Triangle indicates location of hinge. E) Side view of fully bent dimer conformation superimposed on a transparent unbent α-actinin dimer. The bending results in two termini being side by side not on top of each other because of the 90-degree coiled-coil conformation. F) Index coloring representation of the α-actinin rod domain monomer.

<p>Simulation of bending of the monomer suggested bending flexibility. Interestingly, the bent monomer arranged itself into a coiled-coil structure. Total force as low as 24 pN was able to achieve complete bending of the α-actinin rod domain monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The bending simulation showed initial movement by repeats (R1 and R4) followed by movement by the other two repeats and swift collapse of the two ends together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Once bending of the α-actinin rod domain monomer to zero degrees between the termini was completed, the molecule proceeded to adopt a coiled-coil conformation similar to the dimer conformation, only two spectrin repeats in length not four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). The C-terminus spectrin repeat moves from being in plane with the central linker and the N-terminus to being in plane with the N-terminus but rotated 90 degrees relative to the central linker. The final conformation of the bent monomer is similar to the conformation of half of the full dimer with R1 and R4 in surface contact, and R2 and R3 in surface contact.</p>
<p>The molecular dynamics simulations under bending forces with the α-actinin dimer showed more resistance to bending than the α-actinin rod domain monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The minimum force required to completely bend the dimer was 100 pN compared to the 24 pN to bend the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4 A and C</xref>). Different force levels also showed different rates of bending (as with the simulations of monomer bending). The trajectory of bending shows non-localized movement of the entire molecule during bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Repeats 1 and 4 moved before repeats 2 and 3, but the bending force was later transduced and the entire dimer showed movement together. A side view of the bent dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) shows that the two bent halves of the molecule fail to collapse on top of each other because of the 90 degree coiled-coil conformation in the dimer conformation; the molecule halves sit next to each other. Further supercoiling is not seen upon bending as in the monomer simulations since R1 and R4 are already in surface contact at both ends of the dimer, and there are no exposed complementary surfaces or unsatisfied salt bridges to interact and coil.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Torsion</title>
<p>Using rotating constraints, we implemented a molecular dynamics study of torsion induced conformational changes in the α-actinin rod domain. Torque was applied first to a single monomer of the rod domain at both the N-terminus and C-terminus, and also to a single monomer in dimer conformation. For comparison between torsional simulations of the monomer and dimer we define terminus A as the terminus with residue 1 (N-terminus in the monomer) and terminus B as the terminus with residue 475 (C-terminus in the monomer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Torque studies of the dimer involved rotation of terminus A and terminus B of one monomer in dimer conformation. Direction of rotation is defined as either clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to the viewing angle looking along the axis of rotation at the site of torsion. Clockwise rotation at terminus B refers to clockwise rotation if viewed along the axis of rotation at terminus B, and would therefore be seen as counterclockwise if viewed along the axis of rotation from terminus A. To avoid ambiguity, all rotation directions referred to are viewed from the terminus at which the rotation is taking place.</p>

<p>The trajectory of the α-actinin monomer under torsional simulation was largely determined by interaction between terminal aromatic residues near the torsional stress. Rotation at both terminus A and terminus B required different levels of torque for the clockwise and the counterclockwise rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g006">Figure 6 A and B</xref>). Clockwise rotation beyond 140 degrees required significantly more torque than counterclockwise rotation at both terminus A and terminus B. The increasing demand for torque to continue rotation in the clockwise direction is explained by the existence of aromatic packing in the α-actinin rod domain. Aromatic packing describes the arrangement of nearby aromatic residues in either an orientation with the aromatic rings stacked on top of each other or with the edge of one aromatic ring stacked against the face of another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Waters1">[40]</xref>. These aromatic packing arrangements are highly stable due to a combination of van der Waals (VDW) interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Hunter1">[41]</xref>. Aromatic stacking interactions can be further stabilized by π electron sharing between two stacked aromatic rings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Burley1">[42]</xref>. Near terminus B there is interaction between aromatic residues W381, Y417, and W453 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Clockwise rotation at terminus B disrupted the aromatic packing between these residues after 140 degrees of rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g007">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s007">Video S3</xref>) and further rotation is thereafter increasingly energetically unfavorable. Rotation of terminus B in the counterclockwise direction failed to disrupt the aromatic packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) even after 140 degrees of rotation. Similarly, at terminus A there are two sets of aromatic packing interactions. One set immediately near to terminus A is made up of Y15, F74, and F89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The other set further back from terminus A but still in repeat R1 is made up of amino acid residues W104, Y25, Y55, W32, F52, Y114, and W117. Although rotation in either clockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) or counterclockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), direction at terminus A fails to completely disrupt the aromatic packing at these two sites, clockwise rotation does reduce the extent of aromatic packing in the first set nearest the terminus. The decrease in favorable aromatic interactions increases the energetic cost of further rotation and thus requires more torque. Rotation in the counterclockwise direction at both terminus A and terminus B showed a slight decrease in torque required for rotation beyond 140 degrees. The reduction can be explained by free rotation about bonds in adjacent residues and the fact that aromatic packing interactions are not disrupted. Rotation at terminus B shows less sensitivity to the direction of rotation as compared to rotation at terminus A, suggesting a more significant impact of aromatic interactions on stability near terminus A than near terminus B.</p>

<p>The trajectory of the α-actinin rod domain dimer under torsional simulation was largely a result of steric interactions between the rod domain monomers. The topology of R1 near terminus A is different from the topology of R4 near terminus B, and the steric interactions with each of their respective complementary repeats after rotation is different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Rotation of terminus A in the clockwise direction lacks steric interactions with the complementary monomer and thus requires less torque for rotation than does the counterclockwise rotation at terminus A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g006">Figure 6 C</xref>). Counterclockwise rotation of terminus A results in steric interactions with the complementary monomer after only 60 degrees of rotation, and results in an increase in torque required for rotation after only 60 degrees of rotation. At terminus B both rotation in the clockwise and the counterclockwise direction result in steric interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g008">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s008">Video S4</xref>). The steric interactions occur when α-actinin is rotated beyond 150 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). There is a greater resistance to clockwise rotation than counterclockwise rotation at terminus B because clockwise rotation involves both steric interactions and disruption of the aromatic packing.</p>

<p>The results from torsional molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the dimerization of the α-actinin rod domain prevents rotation by introducing steric interactions that increase the torque needed to achieve rotation. Simulations of rotation of the monomer needed maximum 330 pN*nm of torque to rotate, while simulation of rotation of the dimer needed maximum 450 pN*nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Aside from the steric interactions, the rotation of each monomer was resisted by aromatic packing interactions. The aromatic interaction had the additional effect of localizing most of the rotation to terminal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Normal mode analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g003">3</xref>) also showed localization of the torsional movements to the terminal residues. Because of the strength of the aromatic interactions, it is likely more favorable for the α-actinin rod domain to further rotate terminal residues than to disrupt the aromatic packing and rotate other regions of the molecule. It is conceivable that the rotation may be localized to the terminal regions because of the speed of the rotation simulation, i.e. due to insufficient time for rotation to propagate to central regions as torque is applied. To test the effects of angular velocity on rotation we rotated the C-terminus of the two central repeats of the rod domain in the clockwise direction using two different rotational velocities: 0.5 degrees/ps and 0.05 degrees/ps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Rotation of the C-terminus of two central repeats in the clockwise direction at a slower rate showed a decrease in localization of conformational change to the terminus. Equilibration after rotation at terminus A did not, however, result in increased propagation of rotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Both rotation at a slower rotational velocity and equilibration after rotation allow time for the torque to propagate to nearby residues. The aromatic packing interactions in repeat 4 however prevent propagation of rotation when torque is applied at terminus A, even after adequate equilibration after application of the torque (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Comparison of the angular velocity used in the molecular dynamics simulations to the angular velocity calculated for torsional normal modes (∼0.005 degrees/ps) suggests rotation during molecular vibration is 100× slower than in our molecular dynamic simulation.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Extension</title>
<p>Using constant-force molecular dynamics we explored the mechanical properties of α-actinin. Constant-force molecular dynamics is simulation of the conformational changes in a molecule resulting from application of a constant external force to specific residues. In the α-actinin simulations here, we apply a constant force to the C-terminus (terminus B) of one monomer and hold the other terminus fixed. Specific conformational changes are indicative of structural properties. Our simulations suggest that specific electrostatic interactions within each monomer and between the monomers contribute significantly to the stability of the rod domain dimer under extensional simulation.</p>
<p>The α-actinin rod domain showed significant extensional rigidity. Forces were applied ranging from 100 pN to 200 pN to a monomer alone and to a monomer in dimer conformation, and only the monomer conformation with 150 pN or more of force was completely extended after simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Interactions within a single α-actinin rod domain stabilize the individual monomers under extension. Three key interactions dictate the extension trajectory of a single α-actinin monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g011">Figure 11</xref>): T41-E129, E278-K440, and E159-R321. Studying the extension trajectory of an α-actinin rod domain monomer under a 100 pN force shows that every break in one of these three interactions corresponds to an increase in the extension rate of the monomer. Simulations with larger forces induce conformational changes at too rapid a rate to capture specific interactions. The simulation at 100 pN shows that before the T41-E129 interaction breaks, the extension of the monomer is due to helical regions near the terminus and linker helical regions. Once T41-E129 breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g011">Figure 11B</xref>), the extension increases from helical unraveling in R1 and R2. The next big increase in extension occurs when the E278-K440 interaction breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g011">Figure 11C</xref>). The extension continues and is once again extended with the extension and eventual breaking of the third key interaction E159-R321 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g011">Figure 11D</xref>). The precise correlation of extension profile to salt bridge breakdown indicates the role these internal interactions play in stabilizing the individual monomers in the α-actinin rod.</p>

<p>Dimerization increases the structural rigidity of α-actinin by introducing 22 specific charged interactions between the two monomers: E71-R937, R56-E929, R56-E922, E115-R925, R57-D897, E900-R925, R53-E908, K134-D745, K138-D743, K138-E741, R186-E741, E266-R661, E266-K613, D270-K613, D270-K609, E433-R528, E447-R531, E425-R450, E454-R531, E447-R450, D422-R532, and R462-E546. These interactions anchor one monomer under forced extension to the other monomer, increasing rigidity and reducing the length of extension.

Furthermore, the extensional force is being applied to one monomer but in all four repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g012">Figure 12 C–F</xref>) the extension is not limited to only the stressed monomer; the salt bridges cause extension in the associated monomers as well.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The actin filament cytoskeletal network is highly dynamic and stressed. Actin filaments are in continuous movement and rearrangements, and are also continuously exposed to external stresses. As an actin filament crosslinker, it is therefore functionally necessary for α-actinin to be both rigid and be able to withstand the external stress exposure, and to flexibly and dynamically scaffold the actin filaments. The structural mechanisms determining the necessary partial flexibility of α-actinin are as yet not fully understood. By applying methods of computational simulation and normal mode analysis we suggest several possible explanations for the molecular basis of the partial flexibility. Our results suggest that the α-actinin rod domain is flexible and dynamic near its termini while its central helical linkers are rigid, and its dimerized surface is highly stable. Our results also suggest that α-actinin has bending flexibility. Our molecular dynamics simulations suggest aromatic packing interactions play a role in resisting torsion, while electrostatic interactions play a role in resisting extension.</p>
<p>Our NMA study suggested that the most natural vibrational mode of the α-actinin rod domain, both for monomer and dimer conformations, is bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g003">3</xref>). This result was then further tested by our molecular dynamics simulations, which suggested bending forces as low as 24 pN could bend the α-actinin rod monomer. The NMA results suggested that extensional natural frequencies are at physiologically irrelevant higher frequencies and not in the low frequency normal modes (up to mode 18 at 21 Hz). Again, our molecular dynamics simulations suggested that extension of the α-actinin dimer requires extensional forces of over 200 pN. Physiologically, α-actinin needs to stabilize the actin filaments even if they are moving closer together, and the bending flexibility suggested by our study could contribute to α-actinin's ability to do so. These results are consistent with previous studies on DNA, myosin S2 region, and keratin, which also suggested that the coiled-coil structure allows for bending and torsional flexibility but has extensional rigidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Liu1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Schwaiger1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown through electron microscopy that α-actinin crosslinks actin filaments at numerous angles and lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Rief1">[35]</xref>. Their work suggests that although the actin filaments are continuously in lateral and horizontal movement, the α-actinin crosslinker is able to maintain its crosslink of the actin filaments. Our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the α-actinin rod domain has bending flexibility, and that the rod domain is likely to bend while the crosslinker is under compressive stress. The exact direction of any physiological compressive stress is likely different from the bending forces used in our simulations, but the bending flexibility suggested by our simulations is likely the same.</p>
<p>The NMA results as well as the torsional molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the torsion of the molecule during its natural vibrations occurred mostly near its termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Flexibility near the termini suggests that the flexible region of the α-actinin structure is its neck region, which connects the regions near the termini of the rod domain to the ABD and Cam domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Flexibility in the neck region has been suggested several times, most recently by Sjoblom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Sjoblom2">[43]</xref>, and our results further suggest that the flexibility in that region is structurally facilitated by flexibility at the rod domain near its termini.</p>
<p>An interesting result from the bending simulations was the super coiling that occurred when bending a single α-actinin rod domain monomer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). The monomer was bent in half and immediately arranged itself into a coiled-coil conformation. The bent monomer had several similarities to the dimer molecule; it was twisted 90 degrees, it had R1 interacting with R4, and R2 interacting with R3. The phenomenon suggests that the coiled-coil conformation is a result of the complementary surfaces on R1 and R4 and on R2 and R3.</p>
<p>The torsional studies pointed out the role the aromatic residues in each spectrin repeat play in stabilizing the α-actinin molecule. The aromatic packing play a critical role in resisting torsion and more importantly in restricting rotation to regions near the termini while the molecule is subjected torsion. The importance of the aromatic residues as suggested by our results is consistent with a previous study which suggested that aromatic residues in the spectrin repeats are conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-DjinovicCarugo1">[8]</xref>, and with previous studies on DNA which showed that aromatic packing plays a critical role in DNA structural characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Liu1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Bloomfield1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our extension results provide interesting insight into the mechanisms of dimer stabilization. The α-actinin rod domain was stabilized by both charged interaction within each monomer and by electrostatic interactions at the surface between the two monomers. Furthermore, the charged surface interactions relay extension on only one monomer into extension in the other monomer. Several previous studies are consistent with this phenomenon and our results strengthen these past studies. Law et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Law2">[44]</xref> studied the interaction of α-spectrin and ß-spectrin in dimerization while external forces were applied. They suggested that the regions with stronger intermonomer interactions had unfolding at both monomers, whereas regions with weaker intermonomer interactions had only unfolding in one monomer. Ortiz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Ortiz1">[45]</xref> studied the effects of hydration on linker stability. They found that once the molecular regions blocking off the linker from hydration were broken, the linker lost its conformation. We find in our study that the interaction preventing hydration of the linker region in α-actinin is the electrostatic interactions between charged residues in front of the linker regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Broderick2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Parry1">[46]</xref> have suggested that the mechanisms for stabilization of the α-actinin dimer are electrostatic interactions on the surface and acidic residues on the surface. Our results suggest that the charged interactions on the surface between the monomers play a vital role in providing rigidity.</p>
<p>The normal mode analysis results were determined using the WEBnm@ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Law2">[44]</xref> method which shows global conformational movements of the rod domain. In contrast, the molecular dynamics simulations of rotation, bending, and extension, all showed local conformational changes determined by interactions at the atomic level. The results from both sets of investigations are similar and therefore suggest that the global conformational changes seen in the normal modes are correlated to local atomic interactions seen in the molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
<p>Results from our study suggest the α-actinin rod domain is stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the monomers, aromatic interactions within each monomer, and steric interactions between the monomers. The results also suggest that the rod domain has bending flexibility, torsional flexibility near its termini, and extensional rigidity. These mechanical properties could play a role in facilitating α-actinin's role as an actin filament crosslinker. Experimental investigations can further test some of the results presented here. Our results suggest that mutation of aromatic residues would reduce resistance to torsion, and mutation of electrostatic residues would reduce extensional rigidity. Mutagenesis of such residues, therefore, could reduce the mechanical stability of α-actinin and decrease its effectiveness as an actin filament crosslinker.</p>

<p>Natural frequencies of both the monomer of the α-actinin rod and its dimer form were determined using WEBnm@ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Hollup1">[47]</xref>. WEBnm@ is an online normal mode analysis tool developed using the computational methods of Hinsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Hinsen1">[48]</xref>. Normal modes are calculated by determining the eigenvectors of the matrix of second derivatives of energy with respect to displacement of the Cα atoms of each residue. Because NMA represents movements resulting from overall structure, the use of Cα force fields are sufficient for NMA calculations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Ma1">[49]</xref>. WEBnm@ uses MMTK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Hinsen2">[50]</xref> toolkits internally and provides a web graphical user interface for implementing MMTK scripts. MMTK is an open source library of molecular modeling scripts developed in the PYTHON programming language. The 6 lowest frequency modes of α-actinin represent the translational and rotational normal modes and are ignored since these modes involve whole protein movement and demonstrate no conformational dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Brooks1">[51]</xref>. The next 6 lowest frequency normal modes (modes 7–12) exhibit the lowest energy natural vibrational frequencies and conformational movement. The natural frequencies are a property of the molecular structure and can be used to differentiate rigid molecular regions from flexible molecular regions. The natural frequencies also reveal movements (such as bending, torsion, or extension) that are natural to the molecular structure of α-actinin.</p>

The target atom to be rotated was attached to a reference atom with a spring of known stiffness K.

<p>The torsion simulations were carried out with rotating constraints applied to terminus B or terminus A, and rotated the target atoms in either the clockwise or the counterclockwise direction. For simulations on both the α-actinin monomer and dimer rotated at terminus B, fixation constraints were placed on residues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 84, 85, and 86 at terminus A, and rotating constraints were placed on residues 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, and 475 at terminus B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For simulations on the α-actinin monomer and dimer rotated at terminus A, fixation constraints were placed on residues 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, and 475 at terminus B, and rotating constraints were placed on residues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 84, 85, and 86 at terminus A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Residue 1 and 475 are also part of the axis of rotation, and application of rotation constraints to these residues has the purpose of inducing rotation to these residues once they move off the axis of rotation due to conformational changes induced by rotation of nearby residues. For simulations with rotation targeted at terminus B, the pivot for the axis of rotation was at the α-carbon of residue 1 and the axis was defined in the direction from residue 1 to residue 475. For simulations with rotation targeted at terminus A, the pivot for the axis of rotation was placed at the α-carbon of residue 475 and the axis of rotation defined in the direction from residue 475 to residue 1. The specific axis of rotation used in the molecular dynamics simulations was chosen to be consistent with rotation as seen in normal mode analysis. Normal mode analysis of the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000389-g002">Figure 2</xref>) suggested that the residues near the termini rotate around the axis running through the center of the molecule. The axis from residue 1 to residue 475 is set up to also run through the center of the molecule. For all simulations a spring stiffness of K = 10 Kcal/molÅ<sup><inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000389.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula></sup>2 was used. The reference atoms were rotated at a constant angular velocity of 0.005 degrees per timestep (0.5 degrees/ps) in the positive direction for counterclockwise simulations, and in the negative direction for clockwise simulations. Simulations were run for 400 ps to achieve near 180-degree rotation. To illustrate the effects of rotation speed, the C-terminus of the two central repeats of α-actinin were rotated clockwise at two different rotational speeds: 0.005 degrees per timestep (0.5 degrees/ps) and 0.0005 degrees per timestep (0.05 degrees/ps) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000389.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Quantitative results of applied torque and angle of rotation were calculated using MATLAB (2007a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA). The average torque applied on each residue during simulation is reported below. Torque values have been interpolated using a fourth-order polynomial fit to reveal trends from the oscillations in applied torque values.</p>

Explicit solvent simulation was run for 100 ps with 100 pN of force, and a timestep of 1 fs. Forced extension simulations were carried out on a monomer conformation with only the four spectrin repeats, a dimer conformation with 8 total spectrin repeats, and single spectrin repeat (R1) created based on the repeat definitions given by Gilmore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000389-Gilmore1">[60]</xref>.

<p>Effects of dimerization on torque required for rotation of α-actinin. The α-actinin rod domain monomer and dimer were exposed to external torsional stress in both the clockwise and the counterclockwise directions. (A) Torsion applied at terminus A required torque of up to 350 pN*nm to rotate the monomer and torque of up to 400 pN*nm to rotate the dimer. Rotation beyond 140 degrees correlated with an increase in torque required for rotation of the dimer and the monomer in the clockwise direction, but not the monomer in the counterclockwise direction. Steric interactions between two monomers in the dimer conformation can account for the increase in torque in the dimer conformation. (B) Rotation at terminus B required torque of up to 350 pN*nm to rotate the monomer and torque of up to 450 pN*nm to rotate the dimer. The significant increase in rotation of the dimer conformation at terminus B can also be explained by steric interactions. In both plots, rotation of the dimer in the clockwise direction is shown in blue, dimer in the counterclockwise direction is shown in red, monomer in the clockwise direction is shown in green, monomer in the counterclockwise direction is shown in purple.</p>
