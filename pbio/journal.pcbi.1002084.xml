        <p>The ability of neurons to differentially respond to specific temporal and spatial input patterns underlies information storage in neural circuits. One means of achieving spatial specificity is to restrict signaling molecules to particular subcellular compartments using anchoring molecules such as A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). Disruption of protein kinase A (PKA) anchoring to AKAPs impairs a PKA-dependent form of long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. To investigate the role of localized PKA signaling in LTP, we developed a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of the signaling pathways leading to PKA activation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Simulations investigated whether the role of anchoring is to locate kinases near molecules that activate them, or near their target molecules. The results show that anchoring PKA with adenylyl cyclase (which produces cAMP that activates PKA) produces significantly greater PKA activity, and phosphorylation of both inhibitor-1 and AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit on S845, than when PKA is anchored apart from adenylyl cyclase. The spatial microdomain of cAMP was smaller than that of PKA suggesting that anchoring PKA near its source of cAMP is critical because inactivation by phosphodiesterase limits diffusion of cAMP. The prediction that the role of anchoring is to colocalize PKA near adenylyl cyclase was confirmed by experimentally rescuing the deficit in LTP produced by disruption of PKA anchoring using phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Additional experiments confirm the model prediction that disruption of anchoring impairs S845 phosphorylation produced by forskolin-induced synaptic potentiation. Collectively, these results show that locating PKA near adenylyl cyclase is a critical function of anchoring.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The hippocampus is a part of the cerebral cortex involved in formation of certain types of long term memories. Activity-dependent change in the strength of neuronal connections in the hippocampus, known as synaptic plasticity, is one mechanism used to store memories. The ability to form crisp and distinguishable memories of different events implies that learning produces plasticity of specific and distinct subsets of synapses within each neuron. Synaptic activity leads to production of intracellular signaling molecules, which ultimately cause changes in the properties of the synapses. The requirement for synaptic specificity seems incompatible with the diffusibility of intracellular signaling molecules. Anchoring proteins restrict signaling molecules to particular subcellular compartments thereby combating the indiscriminate spread of intracellular signaling molecules. To investigate whether the critical function of anchoring proteins is to localize proteins near their activators or their targets, we developed a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of signaling pathways leading to synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Simulations demonstrate that colocalizing proteins with their activator molecules is more important due to inactivation mechanisms that limit the spatial extent of the activator molecules.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Synaptic plasticity, the activity-dependent change in the strength of neuronal connections, is a cellular mechanism proposed to underlie memory storage. One type of synaptic plasticity is long term potentiation (LTP), which displays physiological properties that are highly suggestive of information storage. Because of the role of the hippocampus in memory, LTP in the hippocampus is studied as a model of cellular properties underlying memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Citri1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The induction of long-lasting forms of LTP requires interaction among calcium-activated pathways and metabotropic-receptor-activated pathways, but the interactions among these pathways depend on the extent to which signals are spatially restricted to subcellular compartments. The production of diffusible second messengers facilitates interactions, but interferes with signaling specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Harvey1">[2]</xref>. Nonetheless, an increasing number of experiments have shown that the compartmentalization of critical proteins provides downstream signaling specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Zaccolo1">[3]</xref>. For example, a PKA-dependent form of hippocampal LTP requires not only PKA activation, but also the appropriate localization of PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Huang1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Nie1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Two basic mechanisms have been proposed for compartmentalization of signaling molecules: diffusional barriers and organization into multi-enzyme signaling complexes. Diffusional barriers in neurons are best exemplified by dendritic spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Harris1">[6]</xref>, which compartmentalize calcium due to the small size of the spine neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Majewska1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Sabatini1">[8]</xref>. Other synaptically activated, yet diffusible signaling molecules involved in synaptic plasticity, such as cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Frey1">[9]</xref> and Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Harvey1">[2]</xref>, can spread to multiple synapses that are in close proximity on a dendrite. A second mechanism for compartmentalization is to colocalize enzymes that work together. This organization is mediated by anchoring proteins, which are structural proteins that contain binding sites for various enzymes. PKA is compartmentalized to different subcellular locations through interaction with A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Wong1">[10]</xref>. Binding between the PKA regulatory subunit and the AKAP produces signaling specificity of the diffusible catalytic subunit of PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Carr1">[11]</xref>. Different AKAPs, such as AKAP5, gravin, and MAP2, anchor PKA to different locations, such as to the spine or the dendrite. In addition to binding PKA, various AKAPs bind other enzymes such as adenylyl cyclase, calmodulin, phosphodiesterase, or calcineurin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Dessauer1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Cooper1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Though PKA-dependent LTP requires an anchored pool of PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Huang1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Nie1">[5]</xref>, it is unknown whether the critical function of anchoring is to place PKA near adenylyl cyclase, the source of cAMP that activates PKA, or near target molecules, such as GluR1. To investigate this question, we perform simulation experiments using a novel, multi-compartment model of postsynaptic signaling pathways underlying PKA-dependent LTP in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Furthermore, predictions from the model are confirmed experimentally using electrophysiological and biochemical approaches.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Previous experiments showed that anchoring of PKA was necessary for LTP induced with four trains of 100 Hz stimulation applied with a 300 s interval, but they did not demonstrate whether PKA needs to be anchored near its target molecules, such as the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit, or near a source of activator molecules, such as adenylyl cyclase that produces cAMP. Thus, to evaluate which of these two possible functions of PKA anchoring in four-train LTP is more important, the signaling pathways that underlie synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) were implemented in NeuroRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Oliveira1">[15]</xref>, software for simulating stochastic reaction diffusion systems, in the morphology of a dendrite with spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Four-train LTP induction was simulated using four 1 sec trains of 100 Hz stimulation, with an 80 sec inter-train interval, which produces PKA-dependent LTP experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Kim1">[16]</xref>. Simulations that differed only in the locations of PKA and adenylyl cyclase were compared to evaluate the two functions of molecule co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Adenylyl cyclase location influences cAMP concentration and gradient</title>
        <p>Prior to exploring PKA location, we first investigated the effect of adenylyl cyclase location on cAMP gradients. Simulations were performed with the dopamine D1 receptor and adenylyl cyclase colocalized either to the spine head or to the dendrite submembrane region, these two locations being suggested by ultrastructual analysis of dopamine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Huang2">[17]</xref> and anchoring of adenylyl cyclase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Dessauer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Efendiev1">[18]</xref>. G proteins were colocalized with both the receptor and the adenylyl cyclase for all simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Balijepalli1">[19]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Simulations show that localization of dopamine D1 receptor and adenylyl cyclase in the spine leads to higher cAMP in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Though calcium influx occurs in both spine and dendrite, calcium concentration is elevated in the spine head as compared to the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), similar to that measured experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Scheuss1">[20]</xref>. This calcium gradient produces a greater calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase when it is located in the spine head as compared to the dendrite. Localizing adenylyl cyclase in the spine also produces a large gradient of cAMP from spine head to dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). No gradient from the dendrite to the spine is apparent when adenylyl cyclase is in the dendrite, because cAMP diffuses easily to other parts of the dendrite; also, diffusion of a few molecules from the larger dendritic volume into the smaller spine volume is sufficient to raise the spine concentration.</p>

The calcium concentration in the dendrite near the dendrite influx point, is only slightly higher than the rest of the dendrite.

        <title>PKA activity depends on its location relative to adenylyl cyclase</title>
        <p>PKA is compartmentalized to different subcellular locations through interaction with various A-kinase anchoring proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Wong1">[10]</xref>. A pool of PKA in dendritic spines is created by synaptically localized AKAPs such as AKAP5 and Yotiao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-DellAcqua1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Tunquist1">[21]</xref>. Recent evidence suggests that both Yotiao and AKAP5 also bind to adenylyl cyclase producing colocalization of PKA with its source of cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Dessauer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Piggott1">[22]</xref>. Other experiments demonstrate that PKA is enriched in the dendrite via MAP2 anchoring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Zhong1">[23]</xref>. The PKA anchored to these different locations may serve different functions.</p>
        <p>To explore whether anchoring PKA near its activators or near its targets is more important in the induction of four-train LTP at Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses, PKA was either localized to the spine head, or placed in a focal region of the dendrite submembrane. We simulated these two spatial variations of PKA with the two spatial variations of adenylyl cyclase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The first case had PKA and adenylyl cyclase in the spine head, thus PKA was co-localized with both the source of cAMP and the AMPA receptor target. The second case placed PKA in the spine head but adenylyl cyclase in the dendrite submembrane, thus PKA was near the AMPA receptors but apart from adenylyl cyclase. The third case had PKA and adenylyl cyclase in the dendrite submembrane, thus PKA was co-localized with the source of cAMP, but separated from the AMPA receptors. The fourth case placed PKA in the dendrite submembrane and adenylyl cyclase in the spine head, thus PKA was apart from both its source molecules and its target. The four cases in this 2×2 experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g002">Figure 2</xref>) allowed assessment of the role of PKA location relative to its source, cAMP, or one of its targets, the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit, separately and in combination.</p>
        <p>With adenylyl cyclase located in the spine, PKA anchored in the spine produces a greater activity than PKA anchored in the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The quantity of PKA catalytic subunit is small because it has high affinity for each of its many binding partners (type 4 phosphodiesterases, inhibitor-1, AMPA receptor GluR1 subunits and PKA regulatory subunits), consequently the fluctuations are large. With adenylyl cyclase located in the dendrite, the effect of PKA colocalization is not apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) because of the large fluctuations. When the results are averaged over five simulation trials (which used different random number seeds), a difference between these two cases emerges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The quantity of free PKA catalytic subunit is greater when PKA is colocalized with adenylyl cylcase in the dendrite than when PKA is separated from the adenylyl cyclase. These differences due to location of PKA and adenylyl cyclase were confirmed with statistical analysis (SAS) using the procedure GLM (F = 238; P&lt;0.0001; n = 20). Colocalizing PKA and adenylyl cyclase in the spine produces greater PKA activation than colocalizing PKA and adenylyl cyclase in the dendrite (P&lt;0.001), which produces greater PKA activation than either of the cases with PKA and adenylyl cyclase apart from each other (P&lt;0.001).</p>

        <title>The effect of PKA anchoring propagates to downstream targets</title>
        <p>Another measure of PKA activity is phosphorylation level of downstream targets, of which four (out of many) are included in the model. Three of the PKA targets, phosphodiesterase types 4B and 4D, and inhibitor-1, are distributed throughout the neuron, whereas one of the PKA targets, the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit, is located exclusively in the post-synaptic density of the spine. Inhibitor-1 is important because its phosphorylation level increases with LTP induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Blitzer1">[24]</xref>, and subsequent inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 enhances CaMKII phorphorylation. The AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit is phosphorylated on Ser845 by PKA, which enhances AMPA channel function and leads to increased AMPA channel expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Banke1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Lee1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, to evaluate the role of PKA anchoring on PKA activity, we quantify the phosphorylation levels of GluR1 on Ser845, phosphodiesterase types 4B and 4D, and inhibitor-1.</p>
        <p>The location of PKA and adenylyl cyclase modulates the level of phospho-inhibitor 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; F = 68.8; P&lt;0.0001, n = 20). The differences in phospho-inhibitor-1 levels due to anchoring are larger than the differences in free PKA catalytic subunit. When adenylyl cyclase is in the spine head, mean phospho-inhibitor-1 is greater when PKA is colocalized with adenylyl cyclase in the spine head than when PKA is in the dendrite (P&lt;0.001). Similarly, when adenylyl cyclase is in the dendrite, mean phospho-inhibitor-1 is greater when PKA is colocalized with adenylyl cyclase in the dendrite than when PKA is in the spine (P&lt;0.001). Thus, colocalizing PKA with its source molecules is one critical function of anchoring. Impeded diffusion of the PKA catalytic subunit from the spine to the dendrite, where most of the inhibitor-1 is located, does not prevent phosphorylation by PKA because the phosphorylation reactions are slow compared to diffusion.</p>

        <p>Two additional PKA targets in the model are phosphodiesterase types 4B and 4D. Anchoring PKA produces a change in phosphorylation of phosphodiesterases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) similar to that observed with phosphorylation of inhibitor-1. Namely, colocalization of PKA with adenylyl cyclase in the spine head produces the greatest phosphorylation of phosphodiesterases. In addition, higher phosphorylation is observed when PKA is colocalized with adenylyl cyclase in the dendrite, as compared to when PKA is separated from adenylyl cyclase. Statistical analysis reveals a significant effect of PKA and adenylyl cyclase location (F = 158.6; P&lt;0.0001; n = 20), and post-hoc tests confirm that the colocalized cases produce significantly greater phosphorylated phosphodiesterase than the non-colocalized cases (P&lt;0.001 for each adenylyl cyclase location).</p>
        <p>To better assess the importance of PKA proximity to source versus target molecules, GluR1 phosphorylated on Ser845 is analyzed because it is confined to the post-synaptic density of the spine. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g005">Figure 5C</xref> illustrates that the fraction of GluR1 phosphorylated on Ser845 depends on PKA and adenylyl cyclase location (F = 9.1; P = 0.001; n = 20). Phosphorylation by PKA is greatest when PKA is colocalized both with cAMP production in the spine and with the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit (P&lt;0.001). More importantly, GluR1 phosphorylated on Ser845 is greater when PKA is co-localized with adenylyl cyclase in the dendrite than when PKA is apart from adenylyl cyclase but colocalized with GluR1 (P&lt;0.05). The large fluctuations in GluR1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g006">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that not all synapses will be potentiated during experimental LTP induction. In conclusion, simulations reveal that PKA localization close to the source of cAMP is more important than localization near the target molecule.</p>

Because the rates for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GluR1 are not well constrained, we also evaluated the role of anchoring using a slower rate for dephosphorylation of phospho GluR1 by protein phosphatase 1. This change in rate constants similarly does not change the effect of colocalization on PKA activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002084.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Spine morphology varies widely in hippocampal CA1 dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Harris1">[6]</xref>, and the diffusional barrier of the spine-neck geometry is an important determinant of NMDA receptor-dependent calcium signaling in the dendrite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Noguchi1">[28]</xref>. Thus, to evaluate whether spine morphology plays a role with more diffusible molecules such as cAMP, simulations were repeated using a spine with either a longer (1.0 µm) or shorter spine neck (0 µm), representing the range of experimentally measured values. The longer spine neck produces a greater cAMP concentration and larger gradient from spine to dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

        <p>To test the computational prediction that PKA anchoring close to the source of cAMP is critical in synaptic plasticity, we use forskolin to induce synaptic plasticity in mice expressing Ht31 peptide in the hippocampus and in wildtype controls. Previous research shows that forskolin, which elevates cAMP by direct activation of adenylyl cyclase, induces PKA-dependent LTP in wildtype mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Vecsey1">[29]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g008">Figure 8B1</xref> shows that forskolin-induced potentiation is impaired two hours after the drug treatment in Ht31-expressing transgenic mice (P = 0.012).

No difference in S845 phosphorylation was detected when slices were incubated with vehicle (P = 0.79).

In addition, phospho-inhibitor-1 shows a cumulative increase with subsequent stimulus trains, though cAMP does not. This result demonstrates the importance of inactivation mechanisms for producing spatial specificity.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>PKA is one of the key molecules in the intracellular signaling networks mediating a long lasting form of LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus induced by four spaced trains of high frequency stimulation. AKAPs spatially restrict PKA signaling pathways through the organization of macromolecular complexes that effectively colocalize activators and effectors of enzymes. Compartmentalization of signaling microdomains by AKAPs may be one mechanism allowing spatial specificity of LTP.</p>
      <p>We investigated whether the critical function of AKAPs is to localize PKA near target proteins or near the source of cAMP, using a multi-compartmental stochastic reaction-diffusion model of the signaling pathways leading to PKA activation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Simulations show that PKA anchoring near the source of cAMP and near specific targets both enhance PKA activity; however, anchoring near the source of cAMP dominates. PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 was greater when the PKA holoenzyme was colocalized with adenylyl cylcase in the dendrite than when the PKA holoenzyme was colocalized in the spine with GluR1, but apart from the dendritic adenylyl cyclase. Experiments confirmed this model prediction by demonstrating that forskolin-induced GluR1 phosphorylation was greater in wildtype mice than in mice which express Ht31 peptide. The ideal test of the model prediction would be imaging of cAMP concentration and PKA activity simultaneously (e.g. using both an Epac FRET probe and an AKAR FRET probe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Vincent1">[30]</xref>) during LTP induction using spatially specific synaptic stimulation. Demonstration that cAMP and PKA activity had different spatial microdomains, and that Ht31 disrupted the PKA gradient without altering the cAMP gradient awaits further development of live cell imaging techniques.</p>
      <p>PKA anchoring near adenylyl cyclases by AKAPs is crucial for PKA signaling due to phosphodiesterases, which produce microdomains of cAMP near the adenylyl cyclase.</p>
      <p>In other systems, phosphodiesterases produce microdomains of elevated cAMP near the adenylyl cyclase, and prevent the widespread elevation of cAMP elsewhere in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Oliveira1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Terrin1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Baillie1">[32]</xref>. This leads to preferential activation of PKA that is colocalized with the adenylyl cyclase. The Ht31 peptide, however, disburses PKA outside the range of elevated cAMP, which results in the observed failure of long-lasting forms of LTP. Consistent with this concept, inhibition of phosphodiesterase disrupts spatial gradients of cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Terrin1">[31]</xref> and allows a cell-wide elevation of cAMP to overcome the effect of PKA mislocalization by Ht31 peptide, and rescues forskolin-induced synaptic potentiation.</p>
      <p>The rescue of LTP with phosphodiesterase inhibitors emphasizes the importance of inactivation mechanisms as opposed to diffusional barriers for signaling specificity. The characteristic decay length of a molecule's concentration gradient is governed by the diffusion constant of the molecule as well as the inactivation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Tostevin1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Kholodenko1">[34]</xref>; thus, gradients are stronger when the rate of inactivation is faster than the rate of diffusion. Though cAMP diffuses, increased levels of cAMP only extend to within ∼6 µm of the stimulated spines because of the strong degradation by phosphodiesterases. The PKA catalytic subunit diffuses more slowly than cAMP, yet no gradients of phospho-inhibitor-1 are observed because inactivation of PKA is rather slow, allowing it to diffuse a greater distance. Thus, this result demonstrates that also in stochastic systems the spatial gradient depends on the balance of inactivation and diffusion. Based on prior work, PKA gradients would be expected if a much longer dendrite were included in the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Neves1">[35]</xref>. This suggests that spatial specificity of PKA activity on a smaller spatial scale requires additional mechanisms for PKA inactivation. The presence of a large pool of PKA anchored to MAP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Zhong1">[23]</xref> available to bind to free catalytic subunit throughout the neuron may speed inactivation and provide spatial specificity of PKA activity.</p>
      <p>Though our simulations anchored all of the PKA in a single location, these different pools of anchored PKA probably coexist in a single neuron. Diverse pools of PKA may phosphorylate different proteins in different compartments of the neuron, including the nucleus. Thus, PKA anchored in the spine may phosphorylate proteins in the spine head, of which GluR1 S845 is an example used in our simulations. Similarly, PKA anchored in the dendrite may be more important for phosphorylating molecules in the dendrite; and PKA anchored near the nucleus may be critical for control of gene transcription. The purpose of simulating the anchoring of PKA in a single location was to evaluate whether individual pools of PKA are spatially restricted. Similarly, anchoring proteins have some degree of mobility, and not all of the PKA or adenylyl cyclase is anchored to AKAPs. The mobility of the AKAP bound to both adenylyl cyclase and PKA will not alter the colocalization of PKA with adenylyl cyclase. Nonetheless, allowing for partial mobility may decrease the effect of anchoring near PKA targets in the model and may decrease the difference between colocalized and non-colocalized cases. Therefore, the rationale for completely immobilizing all of the PKA and adenylyl cyclase was to delineate which function of anchoring is most critical. One additional assumption in these simulations is that Ht31 peptide produces a uniform distribution of PKA. Imaging of PKA location in the AKAP5 knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Weisenhaus1">[36]</xref> reveals that PKA is redistributed to the soma. If this redistribution were simulated in the model by locating all the PKA at one end of the dendrite, then PKA activity in the presence of Ht31 peptide would be even lower.</p>
      <p>The targets of PKA activity included in the model are a subset of known proteins phosphorylated by PKA. Phosphorylation of GluR1, either on S845 by PKA or on S831 by other kinases, is sufficient to support enhanced AMPA receptor conductance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Lee1">[26]</xref>; however, there is no evidence that GluR1 phosphorylation on Ser845 is increased after induction of LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Lee2">[37]</xref>. On the other hand, PKA phosphorylation is required for trafficking of AMPA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Esteban1">[38]</xref>. The mutation of Ser845 to Ala in GluR1 does not impair the early phase of LTP, but the effects of this mutation on long-lasting forms of LTP or forskolin-induced potentiation have not yet been examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Lee1">[26]</xref>. Other PKA targets include RIM1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Kaeser1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Pelkey1">[40]</xref>, adenylyl cyclase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Bauman1">[41]</xref>, CREB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Nguyen1">[42]</xref>, and constituents of the mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK) pathway. In particular, PKA phosphorylation of CREB and molecules in the MAPK pathway, either in the dendrite or in the soma and nucleus, are important for the protein synthesis and gene transcription required for long-lasting forms of LTP. Because colocalizing PKA with adenylyl cyclase enhanced the phosphorylation of <italic>all</italic> PKA targets in the model, it is expected that anchoring PKA with adenylyl cyclase also would enhance phosphorylation of these PKA targets needed for transcription and translation that are not included in the model.</p>
      <p>Because the induction of LTP involves complex networks of intracellular signaling pathways, computational models have been developed to gain an understanding of events leading to LTP. Many of these models explain the temporal sensitivity of long term potentiation and depression, but very few have investigated spatial specificity or sensitivity to spatial pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Kotaleski1">[43]</xref>. Two previous models investigated the mechanisms underlying spatial profiles of cAMP and MAPK in the dendrites. Neves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Neves1">[35]</xref> demonstrated that both inactivation mechanisms and cell morphology contribute to the size of the cAMP and MAPK microdomains. Ajay and Bhalla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Ajay1">[44]</xref> explained that the broad spatial profile of MAPK phosphorylation experimentally measured in the dendrite cannot be explained by diffusion, but requires distributed dendritic stimulation. Unlike the present study, neither of these models investigated the role of subcellular location of signaling proteins. Furthermore, the inclusion of spines in our model necessitates a stochastic simulation technique, because the number of molecules in the spine head is small, and inaccurately represented using concentration.</p>
      <p>Spatial, stochastic simulations were critical to the results presented. In particular, the simulations revealed that GluR1 phosphorylation on Ser845 exhibits large fluctuations, both within trials, and between trials. In general, the stochastic fluctuations were large relative to the mean when the number of molecules was low, as compared to molecules which had a high concentration. Thus, the fluctuations in GluR1 phosphorylation on Ser845 and PKA activity were greater than the fluctuations in phospho-inhibitor 1. The large within trial variation also lead to a variation between trials: in some trials GluR1 phosphorylation on Ser845 increased, and in some trials it decreased. The average over multiple trials reduced the stochastic variation, and better represented the results that would obtain when measuring hundreds of synapses using field potentials. The variability in individual trials may correspond to the variability observed in experiments when measuring few synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Bagal1">[45]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because LTP involves spatially-restricted biochemical reactions, spatial modeling was required to investigate the effect of molecule anchoring on enzyme activation. The locally high calcium concentration in the spine was due to the diffusional barrier of the spine neck coupled with strong inactivation mechanisms. Diffusion was required for interaction between the catalytic subunit of PKA and inhibitor-1, and, in some cases, cAMP activation of PKA. Though diffusion coefficients are difficult to determine precisely (range for cAMP of 100–700 µm<sup>2</sup>/sec in vitro) due to the difficulty of measurements in vivo, we demonstrated that out simulation results are robust to variations of the diffusion coefficients.</p>
      <p>Evidence suggests that anchoring of several other molecules is important for synaptic plasticity. Anchoring of calcineurin by AKAP5 plays a role in LTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-DellAcqua1">[13]</xref>. Calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) anchors to PSD95 and either the NMDA receptor or voltage-gated calcium channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Hudmon1">[46]</xref> depending on its state. Some experiments suggest that anchored, phosphorylated CaMKII is not accessible to dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Mullasseril1">[47]</xref>. Though this effect might play an important role in maintaining GluR1 phosphorylation on Ser 831 and controlling AMPA receptor cycling, the role of CaMKII anchoring is beyond the scope of the present research. Nonetheless, the technique and software used to investigate PKA anchoring could be applied to investigate CaMKII anchoring.</p>
      <p>Additional evidence suggests that PKA is critical for synaptic tagging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Huang1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Young1">[48]</xref>, which provides the synaptic specificity important for information processing. The synaptic tag theory proposes that plasticity related proteins required for long-lasting forms of LTP can only be captured and utilized at synapses that have been tagged by previous activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Frey2">[49]</xref>. Our results suggest that PKA anchored with adenylyl cyclase in the spine would preferentially phosphorylate tag proteins in the spine, not just GluR1. Therefore, our study of the effects of PKA spatial location on PKA activity may provide additional insights about synaptic tagging and synaptic specificity. Future simulations will explore how anchoring influences PKA phosphorylation of other substrates in other compartments, such as CREB in the nucleus, needed for production of plasticity related proteins.</p>

        <p>The multi-compartment, computational model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), consists of signaling pathways known to underlie synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Calcium influx through the NMDA receptor leads to calcium-calmodulin activation of adenylyl cyclase types 1 and 8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Wang1">[50]</xref>, phosphodiesterase type 1B, protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B or calcineurin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Quintana1">[51]</xref> and CaMKII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-DeKoninck1">[52]</xref>. In addition to autophosphorylation, CaMKII can phosphorylate AMPA receptor GluR1 S831 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Mammen1">[53]</xref>, and is itself dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1. Dopamine binds to the G<sub>αs</sub> coupled D1/D5 type receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Lemon1">[54]</xref>, which are expressed in CA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Verney1">[55]</xref>. G<sub>αs</sub> synergistically activates adenylyl cyclase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Harrison1">[56]</xref>, which produces cAMP. After binding 4 molecules of cAMP, the two catalytic subunits (PKAc) dissociate from the regulatory subunit dimer (PKAr) and become active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Zawadzki1">[57]</xref>. Targets of PKA include inhibitor-1, AMPA receptor GluR1 S845 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Roche1">[58]</xref>, and phosphodiesterase types 4B and 4D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-MacKenzie1">[59]</xref>. Phosphorylated inhibitor-1 binds to and inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Blitzer1">[24]</xref>, thereby decreasing both CaMKII and GluR1 dephosphorylation.</p>
        <p>Because calcium is crucial for activation of adenylyl cyclase, calcium dynamics were adjusted to emulate experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Majewska1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Augustine1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Holcman1">[61]</xref>.

        <p>Molecules were either diffusible, non-diffusible that were evenly distributed, or non-diffusible that were anchored to specific regions. The diffusible molecules included cAMP, ATP, all forms of calmodulin, CaMKII, inhibitor-1 and the catalytic subunit of PKA. The anchored molecules included the dopamine D1 receptor, G protein, adenylyl cyclase, PKA, phosphodiesterases and AMPA receptors. Because G proteins have limited mobility in the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Lee3">[66]</xref>, they were colocalized with both the receptor and the adenylyl cyclase for all simulations, as suggested experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Balijepalli1">[19]</xref>. To simulated anchoring, the diffusion coefficient of anchored molecules was set to 0. The molecules were anchored in specific regions by initializing the concentration to zero in all but the anchored regions in this morphology. To specifically evaluate which function of PKA anchoring was more important (near the source of cAMP or near target proteins), D1R, G proteins, adenylyl cyclase, and PKA were anchored either in the spine head, or in a focal dendritic region which had a volume that produced a local concentration equal to that when D1R, G proteins and adenylyl cyclase were located in the spine head.</p>

        <title>Modeling-morphology</title>
        <p>The multi-compartment morphology (as default) included a 5 µm long segment of dendrite (0.6 µm wide by 0.4 µm depth) with a single spine. The spine consisted of spine head (0.6 µm diameter), neck (0.2 µm diameter and 0.3 µm long) and post-synaptic density (PSD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Harris1">[6]</xref>. The approximation of a cylindrical dendrite as a rectangular cuboid captured the essential axial and radial diffusion of molecules, as well as the correct surface to volume ratio.</p>
        <p>The morphology was subdivided into multiple compartments in order to simulate the reactions and diffusion mesoscopially. The dendrite was subdivided into 200 subvolumes of dimension 0.12×0.125×0.4 µm<sup>3</sup>, allowing 2-dimensional diffusion The spine was subdivided into 0.1 µm cylindrical or conical slices, yielding 3 spine neck subvolumes, 2 spine head subvolumes and 1 PSD subvolume, permitting 1-dimensional diffusion. One layer of dendritic subvolumes on either edge of the dendrite was considered to be the submembrane region. The 0.12 µm width submembrane region with 0.36 µm width cytosol gave the same ratio of submembrane to cytosol volume as a cylinder with 0.07 µm width submembrane region. For simulations of the 20 µm long dendrite with 11 spines, all molecules were anchored in the spine head; thus the dendrite was subdivided into 300 subvolumes of dimension 0.2×0.2×0.4 µm<sup>3</sup> and two spines located at one end of the dendrite were stimulated. Empirically, these subvolume sizes were both large enough to meet the well-stirred criterion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Isaacson1">[67]</xref> and smaller than the length scale of observed concentration gradients.</p>

        <title>Modeling-stimulation</title>
        <p>Stimulation for long-lasting LTP induction consisted of four 1 sec trains of 100 Hz stimulation. Each stimulation pulse consisted of a 0.7 msec influx of calcium (62.5 molecules/msec) which accumulated during the train to approach a plateau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Scheuss1">[20]</xref>. Calcium influx occurred at two places in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g001">Figure 1B</xref>): one was the PSD region and the other was the dendrite. These two areas represent influx through NMDA receptor channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Sabatini1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Yuste1">[68]</xref> in the spine, and voltage dependent calcium channels in the spine and dendrite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Mills1">[69]</xref>. An 80 sec inter-train interval was used because this interval produces PKA-dependent LTP experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Kim1">[16]</xref>. In addition to the calcium influx, each 100 Hz train is accompanied by a 1 sec, ∼1 uM increase in dopamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Rice1">[70]</xref> (0.8 molecules/msec), which binds to the G<sub>αs</sub> coupled dopamine receptors.</p>

        <title>Modeling-numerical methods</title>
        <p>We used a computationally efficient, Monte Carlo (stochastic) reaction-diffusion algorithm, called NeuroRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Oliveira1">[15]</xref>, for modeling these signaling pathways. The stochastic algorithm was required because many of the molecular populations were small; thus, the assumption of continuous concentration of molecules was incorrect. NeuroRD was used because the large numbers of molecules in the morphology described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002084-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002084-t005">Table 5</xref>) made tracking individual molecules in microscopic stochastic simulators computationally prohibitive. The NeuroRD algorithm integrates the tau-leap stochastic reaction algorithm of Gillespie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Gillespie1">[71]</xref> with a computationally-efficient, stochastic diffusion algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Blackwell1">[72]</xref> that, similar to tau-leap, allows multiple diffusion events at each time step. The leaping approach maintains accuracy while dramatically reducing the number of time-steps required for a simulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Koh1">[73]</xref> as compared to spatial extensions of the Gillespie exact stochastic simulation algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Hattne1">[74]</xref>. Even with this accelerated algorithm, the 600 sec of simulation time (using a time step of 5 µsec) required ∼4 days for the 5 µm long dendrite and ∼8 days for the 20 µm long dendrite.

        <title>Experiments</title>
        <p>We used 3–5 months old Ht31(1) mice which express Ht31 peptide in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Nie1">[5]</xref> and wildtype littermates to verify modeling predictions. All experiments were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal care and use and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and hippocampi were quickly collected in ice cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 124 mM NaCl, 4.4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 26.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM D-glucose bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Transverse hippocampal slices (400 µm) were made by McIIwain tissue chopper and placed in an interface recording chamber at 28°C (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). Slices were equilibrated for at least 2 hours in aCSF (pH 7.4) constantly perfused over slices at 1 ml/min. A bipolar nichrome stimulating electrode (0.5 mm; AM Systems, Carlsborg, WA) was positioned in stratum radiatum of area CA1. A glass micropipette (AM Systems, Carlsborg, WA) filled with aCSF with a resistance of 2–5 MΩ was placed next to the stimulating electrode to record field EPSPs (fEPSPs). Data were acquired using Clampex 9.2 and a Digidata 1322 A/D converter (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) at 20 KHz and low pass filtered at 2 KHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter. Maximum 30 V stimulation was given to the stimulating electrode and slices that have maximum amplitude responses of more than 5 mV were used. The stimulus strength was set to elicit 40% of the maximum fEPSP amplitude. An adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (Molecular grade FSK, Sigma) was prepared as a 50 µM solution and applied to slices for 15 minutes to induce chemical LTP as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002084-Vecsey1">[29]</xref> and LTP was recorded for 3 hours. Synaptic strength was measured by the initial slope of fEPSP. The first 20 minute baseline values were averaged and the average was used to normalize each initial fEPSP slope.</p>
        <p>For measurements of GluR1 phosphorylation, directly after forskolin or vehicle treatment, mouse hippocampal slices were flash frozen and stored at −80°C. Slices were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 9; 1% Sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 20 mM EDTA, 40 µM β-glycerophosphate, and 1∶100 dilutions of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After adding NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), 20 µg of protein was resolved using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and NuPAGE MOPS Running Buffer (Invitrogen) for 2 hrs at 120 V. The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Invitrogen) at 30 mA over night at 4°C. After blocking with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hr with gentle shaking, membranes were incubated with antibodies directed specifically against beta-tubulin (Sigma, 1∶10,000, mouse) and phospho-S845 (Millipore, 1∶1,000, rabbit) over night at 4°C. The membranes were washed 3 times for 10 minutes in TBST. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added 1∶1,000 in 5% milk in TBST and incubated for 2 hrs at 4°C. The membranes were washed as previously described, then incubated with Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Regents (GE Healthcare) for one minute. Excess ECL substrate was blotted away and the signal was detected on film (Kodak BioMax) for several time points ranging from 5 seconds to 15 minutes. Afterwards, the membranes were stripped using 10 mL Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) for 20 minutes at room temperature. The membranes were washed 3 times for 10 minutes in TBST and blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 hr. The membranes were then incubated with total GluR1 antibody (Millipore, 1∶1000, mouse) over night at 4°C. Membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse, incubated with ECL and developed following the procedure as described above. Densitometry was performed using mean gray values on ImageJ software.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>The model simulations and the role of anchoring were evaluated from the total quantity (representing both amplitude and duration of the elevation) of the enzymes PKA catalytic subunit, phosphodiesterase type 4B, and phosphodiesterase type 4D, and the mean quantity of phosphorylated inhibitor-1, and GluR1 phosphorylated on Ser845. Simulations were repeated due to stochastic variability, and the procedure General Linear Models (SAS) was employed for statistical analysis of the simulation results. In order to protect against an elevated type I error due to multiple comparisons, post-hoc tests used planned comparisons only. The effect of PKA anchoring disruption by Ht31 peptide in FSK induced chemical LTP was analyzed using the last 20 minutes of the experimental recordings. The two-sided t-test procedure was used, including tests for equality of variance, separately for the IBMX condition and for the no IBMX condition. Western blots were analyzed by first calculating the quantity of GluR1 phoshorylation on S845 relative to total GluR1, and then using the procedure General Linear Models (SAS) followed by planned contrasts. For both experiments and model simulations, data were first tested for normality using the procedure univariate (SAS), and P&gt;0.05 was considered not significant. Both the bar graphs summarizing model simulations and the fEPSP versus time traces display mean and S.E.M.</p>
