        <p>The Mediator is a highly conserved, large multiprotein complex that is involved essentially in the regulation of eukaryotic mRNA transcription. It acts as a general transcription factor by integrating regulatory signals from gene-specific activators or repressors to the RNA Polymerase II. The internal network of interactions between Mediator subunits that conveys these signals is largely unknown. Here, we introduce MC EMiNEM, a novel method for the retrieval of functional dependencies between proteins that have pleiotropic effects on mRNA transcription. MC EMiNEM is based on Nested Effects Models (NEMs), a class of probabilistic graphical models that extends the idea of hierarchical clustering. It combines mode-hopping Monte Carlo (MC) sampling with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for NEMs to increase sensitivity compared to existing methods. A meta-analysis of four Mediator perturbation studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, three of which are unpublished, provides new insight into the Mediator signaling network. In addition to the known modular organization of the Mediator subunits, MC EMiNEM reveals a hierarchical ordering of its internal information flow, which is putatively transmitted through structural changes within the complex. We identify the N-terminus of Med7 as a peripheral entity, entailing only local structural changes upon perturbation, while the C-terminus of Med7 and Med19 appear to play a central role. MC EMiNEM associates Mediator subunits to most directly affected genes, which, in conjunction with gene set enrichment analysis, allows us to construct an interaction map of Mediator subunits and transcription factors.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptation in genetically identical cells is achieved by an exact tuning of their transcriptional program. It is a challenging task to unravel parts of the complex network of involved gene regulatory components and their interactions. Here, we shed light on the role of the Mediator complex in transcription regulation in yeast. The Mediator is highly conserved in all eukaryotes and acts as an interface between gene-specific transcription factors and the general mRNA transcription machinery. Even though most of the involved proteins and numerous structural features are already known, details on its functional contribution on basal as well as on activated transcription remain obscure. We use gene expression data, measured upon perturbations of various Mediator subunits, to relate the Mediator structure to the way it processes regulatory information. Moreover, we relate specific subunits to interacting transcription factors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Mediator, first discovered by Kim et al. (1994) and Koleske et al. (1994) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Kim1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Koleske1">[2]</xref>, is a large multiprotein complex which is highly conserved in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Bourbon1">[3]</xref>. Yeast Mediator consists of 25 subunits, organized in 4 different modules: head, middle, tail, and kinase module. It is a general transcription factor (TF) that acts as an interface between gene-specific transcription factors and the core transcription machinery (e.g., Polymerase II). Mediator is required for basal transcription as well as for activated transcription or repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Kornberg1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Larivire1">[6]</xref>. In the last years, many successful efforts have been made to gain insight into both structural and functional aspects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Koschubs1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Imasaki1">[10]</xref>. However, though being a well-studied complex, the Mediator still raises a number of unanswered questions: How do the individual subunits contribute to the Mediator's functions? How is the regulatory information transferred within the Mediator complex, and how does it convey these signals to the core transcription machinery?</p>
      <p>Recently, “structure-function” analyses have been suggested and conducted by van de Peppel et al. (2005) and Koschubs et al. (2009) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Koschubs1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-vandePeppel1">[11]</xref>. In a clustering approach, they use expression profile similarity as a proxy for physical interaction, respectively for common module membership. Their method was strikingly successful in identifying physical interactions between Mediator subunits. However, it did not exploit the fact that their data originated from active interventions into the cellular system. Such interventions followed by phenotypic measurements of a cell, as opposed to purely observational data, provide additional insight into the functions and interactions of the respective gene products. Along this line, perturbation experiments have been carried out with low-dimensional readouts (such as cell viability or growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Winzeler1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Giaever1">[13]</xref>) as well as with high-dimensional phenotypes (such as genome-wide expression or DNA binding measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Hughes1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Hu1">[15]</xref>). While the reconstruction of regulatory networks from observational high-dimensional gene expression data has been investigated thoroughly, e.g., by Basso et al. (2005), Segal et al. (2003) and Segal et al. (2005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Basso1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Segal2">[18]</xref>, the statistical analysis and interpretation of perturbation data is an active field of research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Yeang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Gao1">[20]</xref>. Nested Effects Models (NEMs) are a class of probabilistic graphical models which are tailored for the analysis of gene expression perturbation screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Markowetz1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Vaske1">[28]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Frhlich3">[29]</xref> for a summary). They have been applied successfully to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pathway of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Frhlich3">[29]</xref> and to a signaling pathway in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Markowetz1">[21]</xref>. Here, we introduce MC EMiNEM, an efficient and robust learning algorithm for NEMs. MC EMiNEM combines a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MC) sampling procedure with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in NEMs. The MC EMiNEM method is freely available as a part of the <bold>R</bold>/<italic>Bioconductor</italic> package <italic>nem</italic>. When applied to gene expression data from various Mediator mutant strains, it reveals parts of the functional architecture of the yeast Mediator complex. Moreover, it predicts new interactions between its subunits and gene-specific transcription factors.</p>

        <title>Nested Effects Models</title>
        <p>Nested Effects Models (NEMs) are probabilistic graphical models designed for the analysis of gene expression data from perturbation experiments. They are designed to reconstruct the dependency structure of the perturbation signals, and they perform particularly well if this structure is hierarchical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Markowetz2">[24]</xref>. The graph underlying a NEM contains two types of nodes: the perturbed entities (the signals <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the genes for which expression has been measured (the effects <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The edges of that graph describe the flow of regulatory information between the nodes. NEMs split this flow into two parts: the signals graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> containing the edges between the perturbed entities, and the effects graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> describing the assignment of the effect nodes to the signal nodes. We identify the graphs <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with their respective adjacency matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The experimental data is summarized in an <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to the expression data obtained from measurements of effect <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> upon perturbation of signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. NEMs aim at reconstructing the signals graph, assuming a particularly simple regulatory structure: The perturbation of a signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> implies the perturbation of other signals that are children of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This in turn perturbs the effect nodes that are the children of the perturbed signals in the effects graph (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In other words, the NEM predicts an effect of gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> upon perturbation in signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exactly if there is a two-step path from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Instead of modeling the two distributions separately, it is convenient to estimate their log ratio. For each effect gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we perform a moderated t-test comparing its expression after perturbation of signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vs. its wild type expression.

        <p>Consequently, a NEM is parametrized by the tuple <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the space of binary <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrices with unit diagonal, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the space of effects graphs. We assume that the effects graph is <italic>sparse</italic>, such that each effect is linked to at most one signal (i.e., each column of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> equals either a unit base vector of dimension <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or the null vector). According to Tresch et al. (2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Tresch1">[25]</xref>, the log posterior of the signals graph is given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e044" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>For a derivation of Equation (1), see also Section S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>. We assume edge-wise independent priors, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The problem of structure learning in probabilistic graphical models is generally computationally hard (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Lauritzen1">[33]</xref>). A range of methods has been proposed for the maximization of Equation (1). It has been observed that it is very difficult to estimate the effects graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reliably. This is not surprising, since the adjacency matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has the same dimensions as the data matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is therefore desirable to reduce the number of effects a priori. Attaching a gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that never has a positive entry <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to a signal never increases the posterior. These genes are filtered out prior to the estimation. This step can reduce the number of effects considerably (from about 6000 effects to roughly 3000 in the case of the Mediator experiments). Moreover, we extend the set of signal nodes by a so-called null node, which formally corresponds to extending <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by a null column. Genes that attach to the null node hence are always predicted inactive. This implements an automated feature selection mechanism within the model (see also Section S4.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The main objective is the reconstruction of the signals graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Several approaches try to maximize the (marginal) structure posterior <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by integrating out the hidden parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (for a methods review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Frhlich3">[29]</xref>). This marginalization however is a time consuming step that increases the complexity of the respective algorithms by at least a factor of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, making the analysis of larger effects sets (such as in microarray studies) slow or even impossible. We avoid this drawback and develop an efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the optimization of the NEM structure posterior (EMiNEM), which, even for large expression data sets, is able to detect a local maximum within seconds. Since the landscape of the structure posterior is rugged (Fig. S2.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>), we combine EMiNEM with mode-hopping Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MC EMiNEM) for an efficient optimization of the structure posterior. The MC EMiNEM method is freely available as a part of the <bold>R</bold>/<italic>Bioconductor</italic> package <italic>nem</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Ihaka1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Frhlich4">[36]</xref>. It is easy to use, and it does not require external parameters to be set manually. The only parameter that might be tuned is the weight of the sparsity prior, however moderate changes did not change the outcome qualitatively (see also Sections S2.2 and S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). A short introduction to MC EMiNEM is provided in the Supplements (Section S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>, see also the nem package vignette).</p>

        <title>Sampling of the signal posterior's local maxima</title>
        <p>The EM algorithm is guaranteed to find a local maximum which, for unimodal distributions, equals the global optimum. In practice, the posterior landscape <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be very rugged (see also Fig. S2.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). The outcome of the EM algorithm may therefore strongly depend on its initialization, and it may be far from the global optimum (see also Fig. S2.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). This raises the need to explore the set of local maxima provided by EMiNEM. To that end, we introduce MC EMiNEM. In the classical Metropolis-Hastings MCMC approach, consecutive parameter samples <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are drawn from the distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Given <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a random process generates a new proposal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The Hastings ratio, a quantity that involves <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then determines the probability of acceptance (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or rejection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the new proposal.

We can show that the series of local maxima <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> associated to the underlying Markov chain <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is approximately drawn from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ranges exclusively over the space of local maxima.

      <p>Our goal was to establish MC EMiNEM as a general purpose tool for the analysis of high-dimensional intervention data, and to use MC EMiNEM for the reconstruction of the internal Mediator complex signaling network. MC EMiNEM includes three key features for an efficient and comprehensive search of the space of candidate regulatory networks (Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, in combination with Expectation Maximization, and an Empirical Bayes method for the adaptive attachment of effects). We show in simulations that all these features contribute substantially to the method's performance. Then we construct a high-confidence regulatory network of Mediator subunits. The predicted effects graph reveals interactions between the Mediator and gene-specific transcription factors.</p>

        <title>MC EMiNEM's predictions are accurate in simulations</title>
        <p>Extensive simulations were performed to ensure the convergence of the MCMC chain, and to verify the independence of the outcome from the initial parameter choice (see Section S2.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). The prediction quality was assessed in seven parameter settings for different noise levels and different numbers of signal nodes, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observed effect genes and a total number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> edges in the signals graph. For each of these scenarios, 50 NEMs were randomly sampled (for details see Section S3.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). In each case, data was generated and afterwards analyzed with various methods: a simple EMiNEM approach without Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, the original NEM score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Markowetz1">[21]</xref>, the Nessy method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Tresch1">[25]</xref> and a random sampling approach (for details on the competing methods see Section S3.3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). For all methods, the sensitivity strongly depends on the noise level and the number of signal nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). MC EMiNEM performs best throughout all tested parameter settings, except for low noise where Nessy achieves a similar sensitivity. The specificity of all methods is very high, with a value above 98% in all scenarios (see also Fig. S3.7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). A comparison of the method-specific run times is provided in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>. It should be mentioned that EMiNEM itself is extremely efficient, even for large numbers of effect nodes (one run for the Mediator data took 0.1 s on a standard desktop computer). This efficiency is a prerequisite that allows us to perform ten thousands of MCMC steps in the MC EMiNEM algorithm in an acceptable time. For a comparison of run times and scalability of the different methods, see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>.</p>

            <p>(A) Prediction quality. Comparison of the sensitivity of MC EMiNEM and four alternative methods for four different noise levels (top) and four different signals graph sizes (bottom). The sensitivity is depicted on the y-axis, each frame corresponds to one parameter setting. Top: For a signals graph of 11 nodes, noisy data was generated such that for an optimal test with a type-I error (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-level) of 5%, a type II error (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-level) of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would be achieved, respectively.

        <title>Adaptive attachment of effects improves prediction quality</title>
        <p>Our approach attempts to maximize the marginal posterior <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This quantity implicitly depends on the effects graph prior <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, we seek a prior for which the true signals graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scores on the top end of the distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It has been shown that NEM models are asymptotically consistent and identifiable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Tresch1">[25]</xref>, i.e., given the true effects graph as a deterministic prior <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the true signals graph will score best. Thus, a well-chosen effects gene prior might greatly improve the prediction outcome. We tested the following priors: a deterministic prior according to the true effects graph, our Empirical Bayes prior, the data-driven prior used for the initialization of the MCMC sampling (see S2.4), and a uniform effects graph prior. The quality of an effects graph prior is assessed in two ways: First, we calculate the average <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-distance between the prior <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the true prior <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and normalize it by dividing through the maximum gene-wise <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-distance, which is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Secondly, we calculate the position of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> within the marginal posterior distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Each posterior distribution was approximated by the empirical distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for a random sample of 5000 signals graphs. This was done for the 50 NEM samples that were generated in the most realistic simulation scenario (11 nodes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g002">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The results show that the Empirical Bayes prior approaches the true prior better than the other methods, according to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-distances. Furthermore, the resulting posterior is better able to distinguish between signals graphs and to identify the true one (the true graph is located at the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002568.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> quantile for the uniform, data driven and Empirical Bayes prior, respectively, and at the maximum for the true effects graph; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g002">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p>

        <title>MC EMiNEM predicts a robust Mediator subunit network</title>
        <p>The 25 protein subunits of the Mediator are subdivided into 4 distinct modules (head, middle, tail, kinase, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The tail module is believed to establish the contact to the gene-specific transcription factors, based on various TF binding domains, while the head and middle module apparently contact Polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Soutourina1">[48]</xref>. The kinase module is described as having mostly inhibitory effects on gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Elmlund1">[49]</xref>. The perturbation of a central Mediator subunit can have severe consequences on the structure of the whole Mediator complex. It may cause the loss of whole modules or specific submodules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Zhang1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Larivire2">[52]</xref>. The perturbation of a peripheral component might have only local effects on the Mediator structure and, consequently, have fewer effects on transcription. From the structural organization of the Mediator, we therefore expect a hierarchy of transcriptional effects upon subunit perturbations, which makes NEMs a suitable tool for their analysis. As a result of a NEM analysis, we expect the central Mediator subunits that have widespread effects upstream in the signals graph, whereas the more peripheral components should lie downstream. Due to its role as a general transcription factor involved in the formation of the transcription initiation complex, a perturbation of the Mediator can entail global changes in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Holstege1">[53]</xref>. Such effects are completely removed by our normalization procedure and can therefore not be detected. Note that systematic variation in RNA extraction, RNA amplification, labeling and scanner calibration make it generally impossible to reliably detect global shifts in transcriptional activity by conventional methods; the absolute quantification of transcription levels requires new experimental techniques, e.g., as proposed in Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Sun1">[54]</xref>. Our focus in the present study, however, is on effects that are due to the interaction of the Mediator with gene-specific transcription factors. These effects are restricted to the target genes of the interacting transcription factors. They superimpose to the possible global effects of a Mediator perturbation, and hence become visible only after removal of the global effects.</p>

Those comprise mutations of Med7 (N- and C-terminal deletion), and point mutants of Med10, Med19, Med20, Med21 (see S4.1). The raw data is available at ArrayExpress (accession number E-MTAB-1037). Although there exist even more high-quality gene expression data of Mediator mutants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Larivire2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Ansari1">[55]</xref>), we restricted our analysis to experiments that were obtained on the Affymetrix yeast 2.0 array under similar environmental conditions. Luckily, some data were redundant in different experiments, which enabled us to correct for batch-specific effects, and to remove outlier genes (for data pre-processing, see Section S4.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). After normalization and batch effect removal, a straightforward application of the MC EMiNEM algorithm led to identical results in 9 out of 10 independent MCMC runs; the tenth run differed only by one edge (Fig. S4.1, Fig. S4.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). The runs revealed a bi-directional edge assigned to the Med10 and Med21 nodes, which means that these two subunits are indistinguishable in terms of their intervention effects. Their attached effect genes are interchangeable without affecting the model's likelihood. Therefore, according to Tresch et al. (2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Tresch1">[25]</xref>, we combine the two subunits and treat them as one node (see Section S4.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). When Med10 and Med21 were combined, 10 independent MC EMiNEM runs gave identical signals graph predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

We conclude that the former are central architectural components, whereas the latter are peripheral. Indeed, Med7N/Med31 are only weakly attached to the middle module, and easily dissociate from it, whereas Med7C/Med10Med21 are essential for its architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Koschubs2">[8]</xref>. The position of Med19 yet is still unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Takagi2">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Baidoobonso1">[57]</xref>. In our model, however, Med19 is clearly placed in the center of the middle module. The tail module interacts with gene-specific transcription factors and is structurally less analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Larivire1">[6]</xref>. The NEM includes an edge from Med15 to Med2 and thus suggests a more central role for Med15 than for Med2, because the effects upon perturbation of Med2 are a subset of the respective Med15 effects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig. S4.3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>MC EMiNEM provides a map of specific transcription factor - Mediator interactions</title>
        <p>Apart from an estimate of the internal flow of regulatory information in the signals graph, MC EMiNEM returns a posterior probability of the attachment of effect genes to specific Mediator subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The attachment of effects to signal nodes in the NEM framework does not necessarily represent a physical/direct interaction of the Mediator with the DNA. In the case of the Mediator it is sensible to assume that the coupling is mediated by transcription factors (TFs). We extend the analysis of our Mediator network and infer the transcription factors by which this coupling has been achieved (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Vaske1">[28]</xref>). We group the effect genes according to their attachment to signal nodes and according to the direction of expression change upon perturbation. A gene set enrichment analysis for these 16 groups then reveals interactions of gene-specific TFs with specific Mediator subunits/submodules. We used the MGSA algorithm for the enrichment analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Bauer1">[58]</xref>, based on the gene-TF assignment by Mac Isaac et al. (2006) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-MacIsaac1">[59]</xref> (see also Section S4.3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>). Although the attachment of individual effects to Mediator subunits is notoriously variable (see Fig. S3.5 and S4.6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>), the gene set enrichment approach lends its robustness from combining evidence from many attached genes. The result is a map of TF-Mediator interactions, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and listed in Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s004">Text S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>The 21 TF-Mediator subunit interactions mapped by MC EMiNEM were validated using the BioGRID database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Stark1">[60]</xref>. Two interaction pairs were known from the literature (YAP1-Med2, SWI4-Med2). Another eight TFs were known to interact with a Mediator subunit from the same module as the predicted interacting subunit ([GLN3/SWI5]-Med7N, RPN4-Med7C, [SKN7/STB5/INO4/HAP3]-Med10Med21, ASH1-Med2). An interaction with the Mediator has been described for three more TFs ([UME6/HAP4]-Med10Med21, SUM1-Med2), and eight predicted interactions were new (MBP1-Med7C, [HSF1/SKO1]-Med10Med21, [TEC1/YAP6/GTS1]-Med2, [FKH2/YOX1]-Med7N).</p>
        <p>All target genes of TFs associated with the tail module show downregulation after perturbation, consistent with the tail's function to contact gene specific transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Conaway1">[5]</xref>. The same holds for the target genes of TFs associated with Med7N. This is expected, as the genes attached to Med7N are those that show an effect in all perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) and therefore presumably require a completely intact Mediator. The target genes of TFs associated to the rest of the middle module show expression changes in both directions, in accordance with the middle module described as an ambiguous regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-vandePeppel1">[11]</xref>.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g005">Fig. 5 A</xref>) offers a TF-centric excerpt on the MC EMiNEM map from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. It drills in to the target genes of SKO1, which are enriched in the set of upregulated genes attached to Med10Med21. SKO1 is both a transcriptional activator and repressor and forms a complex with the general repressor TUP1 (Saccharomyces Genome Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Cherry1">[61]</xref>). TUP1 in turn targets Med21p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Gromller1">[62]</xref>. A Mediator complex lacking this subunit might thus not be able to forward repressive signals, resulting in upregulated target genes of SKO1.</p>

            <p>A) Expression changes of the target genes of SKO1 across all experiments. Experiments correspond to rows; the respective Mediator subunit perturbations are indicated by the colored boxes to the left of the heat map (coloring is in accordance with the Mediator module structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Target genes correspond to columns. If a target gene is attached to a Mediator subunit in the MC EMiNEM effects graph, this is indicated by a colored box on top of the respective column, using the same color code as for the experiments. Expression changes relative to wild type are color coded by the panel on the right. In the gene set enrichment analysis, SKO1 target genes were found enriched for upregulated genes attached to the Med10Med21 node in the MC EMiNEM effects graph. These genes lie to the left of the bold vertical line in the heat map. Briefly, our Mediator NEM model predicts that they should also change their expression in the Med19 and Med7C perturbations, which lie above the bold horizontal line. Ideally, the expression changes in the upper left corner defined by the two bold lines should be strong and consistent, while those in the remaining part should be weaker and less consistent. B) Same plot as A), for the target genes of SWI5. Since SWI5 targets are enriched for downregulated genes attached to Med7N, and Med7N is downstream of all other nodes in the signals graph, we expect consistent expression changes of the Med7N attached genes across all perturbations.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The transcriptional activator SWI5 has a large number of physical interactions with subunits from various Mediator modules (Med15, Med17, Med18, Med22, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002568-Cherry1">[61]</xref>). This suggests that any change in the Mediator structure affects its interaction with SWI5. Consequently, target genes of SWI5 should change their expression upon any Mediator subunit perturbation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002568-g005">Fig. 5 B</xref>) confirms this behavior of the SWI5 targets: MC EMiNEM associates SWI5 to Med7N, because SWI5 targets are enriched in the set of downregulated genes attached to Med7N, and these are consistently downregulated in all perturbations.</p>
        <p>Similar analyses were carried out for all TFs in the MC EMiNEM map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s003">Figure S1</xref>; lists of genes that contribute to the respective TF enrichments are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002568.s002">Dataset S2</xref>). The most striking observation is that the sign of a gene's expression change is consistent in virtually all perturbations for which MC EMiNEM predicts an effect. Since our model is completely blind with respect to the sign of regulation, the consistency in the direction of the expression changes provides compelling evidence that the signals graph reflects regulatory dependencies between Mediator subunits which are likely to be caused by structural changes.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>The reconstruction of interaction networks from high dimensional perturbation effects is still a challenge. We have developed MC EMiNEM, a method for the learning of a Nested Effects Model. We introduced two major improvements, namely an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for the very fast detection of local maxima of the posterior probability function. Mode hopping Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling was then used for the efficient exploration of the space of local maxima. We applied MC EMiNEM to a combination of proper and public gene expression data obtained from Mediator subunit perturbations. It turned out that MC EMiNEM does not only shed light on structural dependencies of Mediator subunits, it also identifies interactions of gene-specific transcription factors with Mediator subunits. Our findings are consistent with the state-of-the-art knowledge about the Mediator architecture and function. By grouping of components with similar profiles, hierarchical clustering has proved tremendously useful for the analysis of expression data obtained from observational experiments. MC EMiNEM reaches beyond the identification of undirected relationships; it resolves directed regulatory structures, and it identifies gene groups with a consistent and specific response pattern. For interventional data, MC EMiNEM is thus the appropriate counterpart to clustering.</p>
