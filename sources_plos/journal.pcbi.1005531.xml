<abstract>
<p>Synonymous rare codons are considered to be sub-optimal for gene expression because they are translated more slowly than common codons. Yet surprisingly, many protein coding sequences include large clusters of synonymous rare codons. Rare codons at the 5’ terminus of coding sequences have been shown to increase translational efficiency. Although a general functional role for synonymous rare codons farther within coding sequences has not yet been established, several recent reports have identified rare-to-common synonymous codon substitutions that impair folding of the encoded protein. Here we test the hypothesis that although the usage frequencies of synonymous codons change from organism to organism, codon rarity will be conserved at specific positions in a set of homologous coding sequences, for example to tune translation rate without altering a protein sequence. Such conservation of rarity–rather than specific codon identity–could coordinate co-translational folding of the encoded protein. We demonstrate that many rare codon cluster positions are indeed conserved within homologous coding sequences across diverse eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal species, suggesting they result from positive selection and have a functional role. Most conserved rare codon clusters occur within rather than between conserved protein domains, challenging the view that their primary function is to facilitate co-translational folding after synthesis of an autonomous structural unit. Instead, many conserved rare codon clusters separate smaller protein structural motifs within structural domains. These smaller motifs typically fold faster than an entire domain, on a time scale more consistent with translation rate modulation by synonymous codon usage. While proteins with conserved rare codon clusters are structurally and functionally diverse, they are enriched in functions associated with organism growth and development, suggesting an important role for synonymous codon usage in organism physiology. The identification of conserved rare codon clusters advances our understanding of distinct, functional roles for otherwise synonymous codons and enables experimental testing of the impact of synonymous codon usage on the production of functional proteins.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Proteins are long linear polymers that must fold into complex three-dimensional shapes in order to carry out their cellular functions. Every protein is synthesized by the ribosome, which decodes each trinucleotide codon in an mRNA coding sequence in order to select the amino acid residue that will occupy each position in the protein sequence. Most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon, but these synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency. Rare codons are associated with generally slower rates for protein synthesis, and for this reason have traditionally been considered mildly deleterious for efficient protein production. However, because synonymous codon substitutions do not change the sequence of the encoded protein, the majority view is that they merely reflect genomic ‘background noise’. To the contrary, here we show that the positions of many synonymous rare codons are conserved in mRNA sequences that encode structurally similar proteins from a diverse range of organisms. These results suggest that rare codons have a functional role related to the production of functional proteins, potentially to regulate the rate of protein synthesis and the earliest steps of protein folding, while synthesis is still underway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons, but these synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency. Rare codons generally correlate with lower levels of cognate tRNA, or weaker codon:anticodon interactions [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref002">2</xref></italic>]. As a result, rare codons are generally associated with slower translation rates and are typically considered deleterious, due to their negative impact on high level gene expression [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref003">3</xref></italic>] and sometimes lower translational accuracy [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref004">4</xref></italic>]. The conventional view holds that selection favors common codons, which are considered translationally optimal, but a low level of rare codons is incorporated due to random mutational drift and weak selection [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref005">5</xref></italic>]. However, the distribution of rare codons is non-random: clusters of synonymous rare codons are widespread in the coding sequences of most prokaryotic and eukaryotic species [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref007">7</xref></italic>]. Clustering would be expected to exacerbate negative effects of rare codons. This suggests that the distribution of rare and common codons may be shaped by selection and plays a functional role in protein production.</p>
<p>Supporting a functional role for synonymous rare codons, altering synonymous codon usage has been shown to adversely affect the expression level [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref009">9</xref></italic>], solubility [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref010">10</xref></italic>] and co-translational modifications [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref011">11</xref></italic>] of encoded proteins, and is hypothesized to regulate targeting of exported proteins [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref013">13</xref></italic>]. Codon usage can also affect translational efficiency indirectly via mRNA structure effects at the 5’ end of coding sequences [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref018">18</xref></italic>]. Within coding sequences, an intriguing hypothesis suggests that rare codons may slow translation rate to coordinate proper co-translational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref023">23</xref></italic>], potentially to simplify the folding energy landscape for multi-domain proteins [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref025">25</xref></italic>]. Such effects have been observed for <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions of some proteins [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref026">26</xref></italic>].</p>
<p>While previous studies have suggested that synonymous codon usage is functionally important for some proteins, it is not yet clear in which cases codon usage results from selection versus random drift. Efforts in this direction have been stymied in part because many past analyses of synonymous codon usage neglected to account for specific known biases in synonymous codon selection, including the percent GC content at the third nucleotide position of a codon [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref027">27</xref></italic>], codon pair bias [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref028">28</xref></italic>], low sequence divergence between recently duplicated genes (paralogs), and potentially other unknown sources of synonymous codon usage bias. Moreover, altering synonymous codon usage can affect gene expression in diverse ways [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref029">29</xref></italic>]. In addition to the effects described above, synonymous mutations can also affect translational accuracy [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref031">31</xref></italic>], splicing efficiency [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref033">33</xref></italic>], and introduce undesirable nucleotide motifs such as internal Shine Dalgarno sites [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref034">34</xref></italic>]. Some large clusters of synonymous rare codons have no measurable effect on protein folding [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref></italic>]. In addition, even the rarest codons still encode ≥1% occurrences of an amino acid, challenging the identification of statistically significant usage patterns for functionally important rare codons against the background of neutral drift.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that synonymous rare codons that are important for co-translational protein folding might (<italic>i</italic>) occur in clusters [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref></italic>], in order to produce larger translation rate changes than a single codon, and (<italic>ii</italic>) occur at similar positions amongst homologous proteins across the tree of life, as homologous proteins often have similar three dimensional structures [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref035">35</xref></italic>]. Under this hypothesis, evolution would select for codon rarity at a particular position in an alignment of mRNA sequences without necessarily conserving a specific DNA or protein sequence. To test whether synonymous rare codon clusters are conserved during evolution, we developed a rigorous set of criteria, including an appropriate null model and statistical tests, to analyze codon usage in all open reading frames of 76 diverse, fully sequenced genomes. This analysis revealed a widespread conservation of synonymous rare codon clusters, particularly amongst water-soluble proteins, across diverse species. Most conserved rare codon clusters were found within conserved protein structural domains, rather than between domains. These results indicate that synonymous rare codons are frequently subject to positive selection, and have functional importance across the tree of life.</p>

<title>Synonymous rare codon clusters are conserved among families of homologous genes</title>
<p>A complete set of all annotated protein coding sequences (an ORFeome) was collected for each of 76 diverse eukaryotic, archaeal, and bacterial species with fully sequenced genomes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s002">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s004">S3</xref> Tables</bold>). Species were selected to span as much of the tree of life as possible (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s005">S1 Fig</xref></bold>) in order to keep DNA identity low, as species with high DNA identity may have diverged too recently for synonymous codon conservation to be reliably detected. Protein sequences from these 76 ORFeomes were assigned to homolog families, and the sequences within each family were aligned (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). To reduce potential false-positive results arising from recent gene duplications (paralogs), homolog families were trimmed to include only one sequence from each organism (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>).</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the analysis pipeline. From the ORFeomes of 76 species, homolog families were assigned using OrthoMCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref041">41</xref>]. Protein sequences within each family were aligned using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref042">42</xref>]. ORFeome coding sequences were analyzed to locate rare codon clusters, and peak locations were spliced into alignments. These alignments of peaks were used as input for co-occurrence analysis. To avoid false positives due to closely related paralogs, homolog families were filtered to contain a maximum of one sequence from each species. Co-occurrence analysis determines if rare codon clusters in the resulting homolog families align more than expected by random chance. Terminal trimming removed 5’ and 3’ sequence termini, to identify co-occurrence of non-terminal rare codon clusters. Random reverse translations (RRTs) control for rare codon co-occurrence for reasons unrelated to codon rarity (see text for details). (<bold>B</bold>) Conservation of rare codons within homolog families is widespread. White bars indicate homolog families with conservation of rare codons at any position; black bars indicate homolog families with significant co-occurrence in regions other than the 5’ and 3’ termini.</p>

<p>The conserved codon usage patterns we sought to identify in these homolog families are those that do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence, as amino acid sequence changes can alter protein function, binding and/or stability. For this reason, we used the %MinMax algorithm [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref></italic>] to analyze position-specific synonymous codon usage in each coding sequence. This algorithm compares the codon usage of the actual mRNA sequence to that of theoretical sequences encoding the same amino acid sequence using the most rare and common codons for each amino acid (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>), returning a value that reflects the relative rareness of the codons used to encode a specific amino acid sequence. A codon is defined as rare if its usage frequency within an ORFeome is less than the average usage frequency for codons within the same synonymous set [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref></italic>]. In contrast, other codon usage calculators compare the absolute rarity of one codon versus all other 61 sense codons, which can reflect amino acid rarity due to unavoidable functional constraints on the amino acid sequence [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref036">36</xref></italic>]. It has previously been shown that relative codon rarity is highly correlated with local translation rate [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref039">39</xref></italic>] and changes to it can alter co-translational folding [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref023">23</xref></italic>]. Changes to relative codon rarity correlate with changes in co-translational folding equally well as translation adaptive index (tAI) [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref016">16</xref></italic>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s006">S2 Fig</xref></bold>), but does not require fitting to an adjustable parameter.</p>
<p>Locations of synonymous rare codon clusters within the aligned coding sequences were determined, and this data was used as the input for conservation statistical analysis, which included three steps (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). The initial step tested whether rare codon clusters in homolog families co-occur (align) more often than expected by random chance across the entire dataset. We counted the total number of rare codon cluster peaks that fall within a distance of +/- 2 positions across each homolog family, and compared this number of co-occurring rare codon clusters with the number from a null model where rare codon clusters were distributed randomly across coding sequences. We generated the null distribution by randomly shifting the protein sequence from each organism without distorting the positional relationships of codon usage (see Supplementary Information for a detailed description). This test returned a p-value &lt;1x10<sup>-300</sup>, providing strong evidence that rare codon clusters as a whole tend to occur at the same positions across organisms.</p>
<p>The broad analysis described above determined that rare codon clusters in general show a non-random distribution, with 26% of homolog families showing significant rare codon co-occurrence (p-value &lt; 1x10<sup>-4</sup>). However, it is possible that rare codon clusters might occur at the same positions in homologs for reasons unrelated to codon rarity, including amino acid bias, selection for %GC content, known codon pair biases [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref040">40</xref></italic>] or other, unknown factors. Hence in the second step of the statistical analysis the homolog families with significant rare codon co-occurrence were filtered to remove families where co-occurrence did not differ significantly from co-occurrence found in random reverse translations (RRTs), a Monte Carlo simulation method we developed to control for rare codons that co-occur for reasons other than rarity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>). Each RRT randomly generated an alternative mRNA sequence to encode an analyzed coding sequence without altering its amino acid sequence, based on the underlying codon usage frequencies of the host organism [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref></italic>]. Crucially, these RRTs replicated the %GC content of each coding sequence and the codon pair biases of the species genome of origin (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>). This simulation generated a null model where co-occurrence of rare codons for reasons other than rarity could be detected using the same bioinformatics framework. This important null model control eliminated 1,047 homolog families; however, a substantial fraction (3,824; or 79%) of homolog families still showed significant (p-value ≤ 1x10<sup>-4</sup>) co-occurrence of rare codon clusters after adjusting for these effects (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>), indicating that these homolog families contain regions of conserved codon rarity.</p>
<p>In the third step of the statistical analysis, we filtered the dataset to determine what fraction of rare codon conservation arises due to previously observed conservation of rare codons at coding sequence termini in many species [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref043">43</xref></italic>]. Homolog family alignments were trimmed to remove the first and last 50 codons and re-analyzed for co-occurrence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>). The majority (3079, or 81%) of homolog families with significant conservation still showed significant conservation after this terminal trimming (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>), indicating widespread conservation of rare codon clusters within the interior of coding sequences.</p>

<title>Conserved rare codon positions correlate with protein structure and function</title>
<p>The conservation of rare codon clusters within homologous coding sequences implies that these synonymous codons are functionally important for protein biogenesis. To identify broad trends associated with conserved rare codon clusters (CRCCs), we first tested whether certain Gene Ontology (GO) categories are enriched and/or under-enriched among homolog families with CRCCs. We found significantly more CRCCs than expected in genes encoding water-soluble proteins that fold in the cytosol (i.e., cytosolic and nuclear proteins), proteins with functions associated with binding, and proteins that participate in processes associated with growth and development (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>). The enrichment of water-soluble proteins may reflect differences in domain structure between water-soluble proteins and those that are membrane-bound. Several of the enriched protein functions, including DNA binding and promoter regulation, are associated with the enrichment in nuclear localization.</p>

<p>If CRCCs function to modulate co-translational folding of the encoded protein, we hypothesized that their positions might correlate with the locations of conserved structural features, particularly domain boundaries. Previous investigations of correlations between rare codons and domain boundaries have arrived at conflicting conclusions (e.g. [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref044">44</xref></italic>]), perhaps because the analyses used small sets of proteins with solved structures. To broadly test whether CRCCs are enriched at or near the boundaries of protein structural domains, the locations of CRCCs were compared to the locations of annotated SCOP [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref045">45</xref></italic>] and CATH [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref046">46</xref></italic>] domains in proteins with PDB structures and domains predicted from gene sequences [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref047">47</xref></italic>]. Surprisingly, this analysis revealed that CRCCs are significantly (p = 1E-9 for human, p = 3E-14 for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) under-enriched near domain boundaries (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). Hence the major function of CRCCs does not appear to be to separate the co-translational folding of entire domains. Instead, CRCCs often occurred at positions where a translational pause would expose a smaller structural sub-domain outside of the ribosome exit tunnel (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s008">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Crucially, small structural motifs such as these often fold much faster than an entire domain [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref052">52</xref></italic>], and hence might be more sensitive to the small differences in the rate of appearance of the nascent chain achievable via synonymous codon selection.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesized that rare codons are enriched in unstructured regions of proteins due to reduced selection for translational accuracy in these regions [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref053">53</xref></italic>]. Such an effect could potentially cause false positives in a study of rare codon conservation, if unstructured, poorly conserved regions in the homologs aligned. To avoid this issue, we focused on alignment regions with high amino acid conservation across homolog families; alignment columns containing gaps in any species were removed from consideration. To determine the fraction of CRCCs that occur in structured regions with conserved amino acid content, we compared to frequency of CRCCs inside and outside conserved domains (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). The majority occurred inside conserved domains, suggesting that these rare codons are in fact conserved and do not result from neutral drift in regions where amino acid content is non-critical. However, although most CRCCs occurred inside conserved domains, a subset of CRCCs did show a small but statistically significant enrichment outside known conserved domains. This result highlights the complexity and challenges of a truly comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage. Going forward, novel computational methods will be required to distinguish between CRCCs with different roles.</p>

<title>Connections between CRCCs and protein length and secondary structure</title>
<p>Coding sequences with CRCCs have higher average length than sequences without CRCCs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s007">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). This result is expected, as a longer length gives more opportunities for a CRCC to occur. Longer sequences do not, however, have a higher density of CRCCs per unit length than shorter sequences. We also assessed whether homolog families with CRCCs are enriched in certain protein secondary structural types. Initially, our analysis suggested that human proteins from homolog families with CRCCs showed a significant enrichment of domains with β-sheet secondary structure (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). However, because proteins from families with CRCCs also have a longer average length (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s007">S3A Fig</xref></bold>), we hypothesized that differences in protein length could be driving the observed differences in domain composition. Comparison of human proteins with CRCCs to a length-matched control set (similar sequence length but no CRCCs; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>), revealed that the difference in domain composition results from an association between domain composition and sequence length, rather than an association between the presence of CRCCs and secondary structure composition, including the presence of transmembrane helical domains (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005531.s007">S3B Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Synonymous mutations were once thought to be neutral. This assumption is the basis of the frequently used K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub> ratio, in which the synonymous substitution rate serves as a proxy for neutral mutational drift [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref055">55</xref></italic>]. However, it is now widely accepted that codon usage in bacteria is shaped by selection [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref057">57</xref></italic>]. The origins of eukaryotic (particularly mammalian) codon usage have remained more controversial [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref058">58</xref></italic>], and it has been argued that the fitness effects of synonymous codon changes are too small to result in selection in species with a small population size [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref059">59</xref></italic>]. However, more recent studies have shown that synonymous codon changes can have phenotypic effects [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref061">61</xref></italic>] and that synonymous codon usage in eukaryotes is at least partly the result of selection [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref062">62</xref></italic>].</p>
<p>Beyond synonymous codon selection in general, whether there are detectable patterns of codon usage within ORFs is still an open question. Previous studies have shown that the distribution of rare codons in ORFs is non-random in most organisms [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref></italic>], however the functional significance has remained controversial, as have the evolutionary reasons (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., selection or drift). In recent years there has been a growing consensus that rare codons at the 5’ termini of coding sequences are conserved and increase translation efficiency [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref043">43</xref></italic>]. In contrast, conservation of non-terminal rare codons is still under active debate, in part because of the many origins of codon usage bias, which can make it challenging to distinguish conservation of codon rarity versus other aspects of codon bias. For example, although a previous study identified low average codon usage frequencies within Pfam domain alignments [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref036">36</xref></italic>], it was not determined whether these codons occurred more frequently than expected by random chance. Further, this study considered only absolute codon usage frequencies, which means that conservation of rare amino acids (e.g, cysteine), which are by definition encoded by codons that are rare in an absolute sense, can lead false-positive results. Likewise, Pechmann <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed rare codon conservation in several closely-related yeast species using a codon usage metric that compares tRNA supply with demand (as determined by mRNA levels) and found some evidence for conservation [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref063">63</xref></italic>], although the relatively recent divergence of these species may make it more challenging to detect significant conservation.</p>
<p>To overcome the challenges of identifying conservation of codon rarity, we aligned synonymous codon usage frequencies across the ORFeomes of 76 diverse organisms and developed a null model capable of distinguishing conservation of codon rarity from other effects, including amino acid conservation, GC bias and codon pair bias. Our study demonstrates that clusters of rare codons are significantly conserved across much more distantly related species, spanning the tree of life, even after accounting for other known codon usage biases, including recently-diverged paralogs, %GC content and codon pair bias. The analysis framework described here can be used to analyze synonymous codon conservation in any organism with a fully sequenced genome. Our results suggest that synonymous codon usage is often subject to selection.</p>
<p>The conservation of rare codon clusters suggests they serve a functional role. Given the diverse effects of codon usage, it is likely that CRCCs have multiple functions. The hypothesis that codon usage modulates co-translational protein folding led to the expectation that the locations of rare codon clusters might be correlated with protein structural features. Studies examining correlations between codon usage and protein secondary structure have identified an enrichment of rare codons in unstructured regions and common codons in conserved, structured regions [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref064">64</xref></italic>]. While rare codons in unstructured regions can also function to promote co-translational folding [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref064">64</xref></italic>], their presence in such locations is also consistent with the hypothesis that rare codons exist due to mutational drift in genome regions under less selection for translational speed or accuracy [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref053">53</xref></italic>]. The CRCCs identified by our study are not enriched at domain boundaries in human or <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> coding sequences. If rare codons do function to separate the folding of protein structural units, these foldable units do not necessarily correspond to a defined domain. Our data set serves as a starting point for more detailed structural and functional analyses, including the effects of mRNA secondary structure on translation rate and co-translational folding of the encoded protein.</p>
<p>The association between CRCCs and the processes of growth and development is particularly intriguing, given that the coding sequences of cell cycle-regulated proteins are enriched in rare codons in general [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref065">65</xref></italic>]. These results are consistent with results showing that substituting common codons for rare codons in the sequences encoding bacterial and fungal circadian regulatory proteins adversely affects the circadian clock and cell growth rate [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref021">21</xref></italic>]. Of note, codon sensitivity in the fungal clock protein FRQ is localized to portions of the coding sequence encoding a predicted intrinsically disordered region (IDR) [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref064">64</xref></italic>]. The functions of many IDRs include binding to other proteins and nucleic acids, often to regulate proliferation and cell cycle events [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref066">66</xref></italic>]. Intriguingly, we found that CRCCs are enriched in proteins with binding functions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005531.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>), suggest that synonymous codon usage may provide a mechanism to regulate cell growth and development across diverse species.</p>
<p>In conclusion, conservation of rare codons is a widespread phenomenon, and occurs in structurally and functionally diverse protein families. Homolog families with CRCCs were enriched in specific structural and functional categories. CRCCs were more likely to be found in water-soluble nuclear and cytosolic proteins rather than membrane proteins, suggesting a possible connection with domain organization and folding in the cytosol. Proteins with CRCCs are enriched in functions associated with development and cell growth. This association is particularly intriguing, given that codon usage has been shown to affect circadian growth rhythms of an organism [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref021">21</xref></italic>], and both tRNA levels and the codon usage of highly expressed genes vary with cell growth rate and cell cycle stage [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref067">67</xref></italic>]. The results reported here should be broadly useful toward the development of a mechanistic understanding of how synonymous codon usage can affect various aspects of protein biogenesis.</p>

Most ORFeomes were obtained by downloading the coding sequences corresponding to all protein coding genes in the species genome from the NCBI database. To avoid fragments not corresponding to full reading frames, only those gene sequences with length equal to an integer multiple of 3 were included in the final ORFeomes. If the same gene identifier was associated with &gt;1 sequence (for example, multiple splice isoforms for some eukaryotic sequences), only the longest sequence was used. <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> cDNA was not available from NCBI, so the transcript set was downloaded from Vector Base [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref071">71</xref></italic>].</p>

<title>Assignment and alignment of homolog families</title>
<p>Families of homologous genes from the 76 ORFeomes were assembled using OrthoMCL [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref041">41</xref></italic>]. Families were edited to remove potential false positives arising from paralogs by including a maximum of one protein sequence from each species. The representative sequence was chosen at random and other sequences from the same species were discarded. For each resulting homolog family, protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref042">42</xref></italic>].</p>

<title>Locations of rare codon clusters</title>
<p>Overall codon usage for each species was determined by counting occurrences of each codon in the corresponding ORFeome. To calculate the relative codon usage along each gene, we used the %MinMax algorithm [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref006">6</xref></italic>], which was designed to identify clusters of synonymous rare codons. %MinMax compares actual codon usage to hypothetical sequences encoding the same amino acids using either the most common (%MinMax = +100) or most rare (%MinMax = -100) synonymous codons for the species of origin. To identify clusters of rare codons, %MinMax scores were averaged over a sliding window of 17 codons, and one or more consecutive windows with %MinMax &lt; 0 were considered a rare codon cluster. For each cluster, the “peak” was defined as the window with the minimum (most negative) %MinMax score.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Identifying statistically significant rare codon co-occurrence</title>
<p>To pinpoint specific rare codon clusters that co-occur, we used the following statistical test. As for the broad test across the entire dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref> and Supplementary Methods), rare codon clusters in two homolog sequences were considered to co-occur if their peaks fell within a distance of +/- 2 positions in a homolog family. For an alignment column with aligned peaks in <italic>m</italic> out of <italic>n</italic> homologs (<italic>m</italic>≥1), the p-value of co-occurrence = P(X≥<italic>m</italic>|X≥1). X follows a binomial distribution (<italic>n</italic>, <italic>p</italic>0) where <italic>p</italic>0 is the probability of a position being a peak (determined by the total number of peaks and the length of the alignment).</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Trimming sequence termini</title>
<p>To separate rare codon conservation within coding sequences versus rare codon co-occurrence at sequence termini [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref043">43</xref></italic>], we located the most N-terminal position where no gaps were found in a homolog family alignment, and discarded any p-values within the next 50 codons. The same process was repeated for the 50 codons preceding the most C-terminal gap in the alignment. This filtering considered gaps because trimming the first 50 codons in the alignment without considering gaps did not trim all N-terminal regions where co-translational folding effects are expected to be minimal (i.e., before 20 aa of the nascent chain has emerged from the ribosome exit tunnel). This method proved appropriate for homolog families of similar sized proteins while not over or under penalizing diverse families containing homologs from diverse species spanning the tree of life. In subsequent analyses, homolog families were only used if a position within the trimmed homolog family alignment had a p-value below the specific threshold considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Random reverse translations (RRTs)</title>
<p>To construct RRTs based on %GC-specific codon usage data, all coding sequences in an ORFeome were sorted into partially overlapping GC3 content bins (for example, sequences with %GC3 of 20–30%, 25–35%, 30–40%, etc.). Overlapping bins were used to increase the number of sequences per bin for more accurate codon usage data while still keeping the average %GC3 content for adjacent bins close together, so that every sequence will have a %GC3 close to the average %GC3 of a sequence bin. Binning was based on %GC3 rather than overall %GC because %GC is correlated with amino acid content and binning by %GC3 is therefore more effective for replicating the %GC content of the original sequence. The codon frequencies within each sequence bin were counted, and the corresponding %GC-biased codon frequency table was used to construct the RRT sequences for each coding sequence.</p>
<p>In addition, certain codon pairs are over- or under-represented in some ORFeomes, and this bias was accounted for in the RRT as a codon pair multiplier. A codon pair multiplier indicates the enrichment (or under-enrichment) of codon A at the -1 position with respect to codon B (5’-A-B-3’), relative to the average local usage frequency of A codons near B codons. For example, to calculate the codon pair multiplier for encoding Leu with CTA before TGC, the average usage frequency of CTA is calculated for all Leu residues within 17 codon windows centered on all TGC codons, with the exception of Leu at the -1 position. The usage frequency of CTA at the -1 position is calculated separately, and the ratio of these two usage frequencies (CTA frequency at -1/average local CTA frequency) gives the codon pair multiplier.</p>
<p>RRTs were constructed from 3’ to 5’. At each position, a codon encoding the appropriate amino acid was selected randomly but biased by the count of a codon in a %GC3 bin and multiplied by the codon pair multiplier for each following codon, in order to obtain a position-specific codon usage number. In this way, the enrichment or under-enrichment of a specific codon is relative to both the local %GC content of the coding sequence and the codon pair multiplier, which indicates how much the usage of a codon should be enriched or under-enriched based on the identity of the following 3’ codon (which is chosen first during the RRT).</p>
<p>For each gene in each homolog family, 200%GC-matched, codon pair-matched RRTs were constructed. Each set of RRTs was analyzed for co-occurrence of rare codons to determine which sites of significant co-occurrence were likely caused by amino acid bias. For each position in a homolog family alignment, we determined how many RRTs had significant co-occurrence at that position. For all alignment positions that had significant co-occurrence in ≥ 1 RRT, we identified the 5% of positions with the highest number of RRTs with significant (p-value &lt; 1x10<sup>-4</sup>) co-occurrence, as these positions are likely to be subject to sequence bias and were therefore regarded as suspect. We disregarded any positions within +/- 8 codons of a suspect alignment position, as they fall within the same %MinMax window.</p>

<title>Gene ontology enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Blast2Go [<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005531.ref072">72</xref></italic>] was used to assign gene ontology (GO) terms to each protein in a homolog family. For each GO term we counted the number of homolog families with significant rare codon conservation that have an ORF assigned with this GO term, and all other instances of that GO term. We then create a contingency table with these counts for each GO term and performed an enrichment analysis using Fisher’s exact test. GO terms were also divided by class (cellular composition, molecular function, and biological process) and the 10 most common terms from each class were analyzed for enrichment.</p>

<title>CATH and SCOP domains from PDB</title>
<p>A PDB BLAST database was constructed from all non-identical protein chains in the PDB by selecting the PDB representative structure, which selects the highest quality structure if more than one structure is available for identical protein sequences. Proteins from the 76 ORFeome dataset were assigned PDB matches based on BLASTP. A match was required to contain an alignment with ≥95% sequence identity. SCOP and CATH domain annotations were downloaded from the PDB. 8.4% of homolog families had a PDB CATH assignment, and 7.8% had a PDB SCOP assignment.</p>

<title>Locations of CRCCs relative to protein domains</title>
<p>Global and local enrichment of significant CRCCs (p &lt; 0.05; post RRT correction) relative to domain boundaries was assayed using CATH, SCOP and Ensembl domains and multiple binomial tests. To test for overall enrichment, we first considered any CRCC within 10 codons of a domain boundary to be “near” such boundaries; all others to be “far.” Using the size of the proteins and domains without gaps, we next determined if more (or fewer) CRCCs occurred near boundaries than expected when compared to a null model where CRCCs were distributed evenly across alignments. The same method was used to determine whether more or fewer CRCCs occurred within domains than expected.</p>
<p>Finally, we assessed fixed 50 residue windows near N-terminal boundaries versus C-terminal boundaries for windows that: (1) followed domain boundaries; (2) were centered on domain boundaries; or (3) flanked domain boundaries. Since the windows were equal size, we first accessed if more (or fewer) CRCCs were found near N terminal boundaries as compared to C terminal boundaries for each protein using a binomial test with p = 0.5. We also considered N versus C terminal boundaries combined across all predicted domains, and compared results with or without the N-terminal trimming procedure described above.</p>

<title>Sequence length control set</title>
<p>Sequences with conserved rare codon clusters (CRCCs) have longer average length than sequences without CRCCs. To control for differences in domain composition related to differences in length, a length-matched control set was assembled. Each human protein in a homolog family with CRCCs (p-value ≤ 1E-4) was matched to the human protein with the most similar length (minimum absolute value of length difference) from a homolog family without CRCCs. Each protein was only included once in the control set.</p>
