<p>RSF1, a new player in the cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks, sequentially recruits centromeric histone-like proteins and DNA repair proteins from the Fanconi anaemia pathway.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>ATM is a central regulator of the cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here we identify a biochemical interaction between ATM and RSF1 and we characterise the role of RSF1 in this response. The ATM–RSF1 interaction is dependent upon both DSBs and ATM kinase activity. Together with SNF2H/SMARCA5, RSF1 forms the RSF chromatin-remodelling complex. Although RSF1 is specific to the RSF complex, SNF2H/SMARCA5 is a catalytic subunit of several other chromatin-remodelling complexes. Although not required for checkpoint signalling, RSF1 is required for efficient repair of DSBs via both end-joining and homology-directed repair. Specifically, the ATM-dependent recruitment to sites of DSBs of the histone fold proteins CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2, previously identified at centromeres, is RSF1-dependent. In turn these proteins recruit and regulate the mono-ubiquitination of the Fanconi Anaemia proteins FANCD2 and FANCI. We propose that by depositing CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2, the RSF complex either directly or indirectly contributes to the reorganisation of chromatin around DSBs that is required for efficient DNA repair.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA carries all the information necessary for life; thus damage or loss of genetic material can result in cell death or cancer. The worst-case insult to genetic information is a DNA double-strand break, caused by agents either within the cell (e.g., by-products of respiration, errors of DNA replication) or from outside (e.g., ionizing radiation). Ataxia telangiectasia kinase (ATM) and the Fanconi anaemia proteins perform housekeeping roles in the cell, recognising aberrant DNA structures and promoting their repair. Mutations that affect these proteins are responsible for the eponymous genetic syndromes that are characterised by elevated mutation rate, increased cancer risk, developmental defects, and shortened life span. In this work we identify and characterise a novel link between these two central players in the DNA damage response. We show that the Remodelling and Spacing Factor 1 (RSF1) protein, which can reorganise the compaction of DNA to allow access for other proteins, requires ATM for its function after DNA damage. Specifically, RSF1 recruits two centromeric histone-like proteins that in turn promote mono-ubiquitination and recruitment to sites of damage of FANCD2 and FANCI—two proteins that belong to the Fanconi anaemia pathway. Absence of RSF1 results in defective repair of double-strand DNA breaks, prolonged arrest of the cell cycle, and cell death. Our study suggests that ATM-dependent regulation of the RSF chromatin-remodelling complex is necessary during double-strand break repair to recruit centromeric histones and then Fanconi anaemia proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA damage can result in mutations leading to either cell death or cancer, and multiple repair pathways exist that are specific to distinct DNA lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Jackson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Ciccia1">[2]</xref>. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are particularly toxic lesions repaired by two major pathways, termed homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), that utilise either homology-dependent or -independent mechanisms. Additional biological responses to DNA damage include altered transcriptional programmes, transient cell cycle delays termed checkpoints, apoptosis, and senescence. Collectively these responses are termed the DNA damage response (DDR).</p>
<p>Ataxia telangiectasia, mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), a pair of related protein kinases, are central to the DDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Goodarzi1">[3]</xref>. ATM is directly recruited to DSBs via the Mre11–Rad50–NBS1 (MRN) complex, whereas ATR, with its partner ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), is indirectly recruited via the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated during DSB processing. ATM and ATR initiate signalling cascades by phosphorylating many target proteins, including checkpoint kinase 1 and 2 (Chk1 and Chk2), which initiate a secondary wave of phosphorylation events. Additional posttranslation modifications, including ubiquitinylation, SUMOylation, poly(ADP-ribosylation), acetylation, and methylation, are also required for a successful DDR.</p>
<p>DNA is packaged around the core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 to form nucleosomes and nucleosomes in turn interact with many other nonhistone proteins to form chromatin, which must be dynamically remodelled for a successful DDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Luijsterburg1">[4]</xref>. Remodelling of chromatin requires a multitude of chromatin remodelling enzymes and encompasses not only nucleosome removal or sliding but also modification of core histones or their replacement by histone variants. For example, SNF2H (also termed SMARCA5) is an ATP-dependent translocase that is the catalytic component of at least four chromatin-remodelling complexes. These include (1) the ACF/WCRF complex composed of SNF2H and the ACF/WCRF protein, also known as BAZ1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Lan1">[5]</xref>; (2) the CHRAC complex composed of SNF2H and the CHRAC1, POLE3, and ACF1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Poot1">[6]</xref>; (3) the RSF complex composed of SNF2H and RSF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Loyola1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Perpelescu1">[8]</xref>; and (4) the WICH complex composed of SNF2H and the BAZ1B, DEK, DDX21, ERCC6, MYBBP1A, and SF3B1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Cavelln1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>An important connection between the ATM and ATR kinases and the ACF/WCRF, CHRAC, RSF, and WICH complexes has been established in a screen for substrates of these kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Matsuoka1">[10]</xref>. Additionally, the ACF/WCRF complex is required for DSB repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Lan1">[5]</xref> and the WICH complex has been implicated in the DDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Bozhenok1">[11]</xref>. More recently, the BAZ1B component of the WICH complex was shown to be required for the activation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX at tyrosine residue 142 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Cook1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although a direct connection to DNA repair has yet to be made for the RSF1 protein, it is required for the stabilisation of the CENPA complex and correct assembly of centromeric chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Loyola1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Perpelescu1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, the CENPS–CENPX centromeric chromatin complex, composed of histone fold proteins that most resemble histones H3 and H4, has recently been shown to participate in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) via the Fanconi Anaemia (FA) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Singh1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yan1">[14]</xref>. CENPS and CENPX have also been termed MHF1 and MHF2 for FANCM-interacting Histone Fold protein 1 and 2. Additionally, overexpression of RSF1 in an ovarian cancer cell line has also been reported to induce DNA damage and genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Sheu1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Patients with FA are defective in a pathway required for the repair of DNA ICLs, causing elevated genome instability and cancer risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Kim1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Deans1">[18]</xref>. The FA pathway regulates the mono-ubiquitination of two related proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI, that in turn coordinate the recruitment of several nucleases required to unhook the ICL, resulting in an unhooked cross-linked nucleotide on one DNA molecule and a DSB on the other. Translesion synthesis (TLS) allows bypass of the unhooked cross-linked nucleotide, necessary for generating a template suitable for HR-dependent DSB repair. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) then removes the nucleotide with the cross-linked adduct. Initiation of the FA pathway requires the multifunctional FANCM–FAAP24 heterodimer, which recognises ICLs, recruits the FA core complex, and contributes to both stabilisation of stalled replication and ATR-dependent signalling.</p>
<p>We used a proteomic screen to identify proteins that interact with chicken Atm and focussed on Remodelling and Spacing Factor 1 (Rsf1), a subunit of a chromatin-remodelling factor. We show that human RSF1 and ATM directly interact and map the regions of interaction between these proteins. RSF1 has been identified as a likely ATM substrate after ionising radiation (IR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Matsuoka1">[10]</xref>, although its role in the DDR had not been characterised. We have defined a role for human RSF1 in the repair of DNA DSBs by both NHEJ and HR. Interestingly, the RSF1 protein directly interacts with the histone-related CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 proteins, previously implicated in centromere function and the FA pathway. We find that RSF1 is required for localization of the CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 complex, followed by FANCD2 and FANCI to sites of DNA damage. Similarly, RSF1 is required for the efficient mono-ubiquitination and chromatin retention of FANCD2 and FANCI after IR. Our data suggest that ATM-dependent regulation of the RSF chromatin-remodelling complex is required during DSB repair for the sequential recruitment of centromeric and FA proteins to facilitate efficient DSB repair.</p>

<title>Generation of the HFSC-<italic>Atm</italic> Cell Line</title>

<title>RSF1 Interaction with ATM Is Dependent upon IR and ATM Kinase Activity</title>
<p>We validated the chicken Atm–Rsf1 complex by co-immunoprecipitation of human RSF1 with human ATM using U2OS osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

RSF1, although chromatin-bound both before and after IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2F</xref>), only co-immunoprecipitated with ATM after IR. Similarly, the SNF2H (or SMARCA5) catalytic subunit of the RSF complex also co-immunoprecipited with ATM after IR. The interaction between ATM and the RSF complex is not only dependent upon IR but also upon ATM kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and could also be detected in extracts from HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). The equivalent interaction detected between chicken Atm and both Rsf1 and Snf2H/Smarc5 was also IR-dependent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001856-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>RSF1 has been reported to be a substrate of ATM <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Matsuoka1">[10]</xref>, and here we show that RSF1 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> is also ATM-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, using the anti-pS1423BRCA1 antibody used by Matsuoka and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Matsuoka1">[10]</xref> to detect phosphorylation of additional ATM/ATR substrates, we show that phosphorylation of RSF1 is largely ATM-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2G</xref>). Moreover, as the C-terminal consensus PIK kinase sites more closely match the BRCA1-S1423 epitope, our data suggest that it is these two C-terminal sites, rather than the N-terminal consensus PIK kinase site, that is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Human SNF2H is also a component of the ACF1/WRCF, CHRAC, and WICH chromatin remodelling complexes, whereas RSF1 is specific to the RSF complex alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Loyola1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Perpelescu1">[8]</xref>. Of note, the BAZ1A (also termed ACF1) and BAZ1B components of the ACF/WCRF and WICH complexes, respectively, were also identified in our human ATM immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2A, S2B</xref>, and S2C) and their chicken homologues, by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001856-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our data are consistent with a previously unreported IR-dependent interaction between ATM and RSF1.</p>

<title>Rsf1 Depletion Results in Defective DSB Repair</title>
<p>Depletion of the ACF1/WRCF complex, including SNF2H, has already been shown to promote sensitivity to damaging agents such as IR, MMS, and camptothecin, and mild sensitivity to UVC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Lan1">[5]</xref>. To assess the role of the RSF complex in the DDR, we performed clonogenic survival assays using IR and MMS treatments with single and double siRNA-dependent “knockdowns” of RSF1 and SNF2H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Depletion of RSF1 results in similar IR sensitivity as depletion of SNF2H. Individual RSF1 or SNF2H depletion also resulted in sensitivity to MMS, although MMS sensitivity appeared more pronounced for the RSF1 knockdown, whereas the double knockdown appeared to have even greater MMS sensitivity, approaching that of ATM inhibition. Cells individually depleted for RSF1 and SNF2H were also mildly sensitive to the interstrand crosslinking reagent MMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). RSF1-depleted cells were only weakly sensitive to UVC, whereas SNF2H-depleted cells displayed the expected mild sensitivity to UVC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). These data demonstrate that RSF1 functions in the cellular response to DNA damage.</p>
<p>In addition to its role in DSB repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Ciccia1">[2]</xref>, ATM has a well-characterized role in the G2/M checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Xu1">[22]</xref>. As measured by accumulation of a mitotic marker (histone H3S10 phosphorylation), single and double depletion of RSF1 and SNF2H resulted in entry into the G2/M checkpoint with normal kinetics that was similar to the scrambled siRNA control, whereas ATM-inhibited cells never entered the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, unlike control cells, which re-entered the cell cycle upon completion of repair, RSF1- and SNF2H-depleted cells remained arrested for the duration of the experiment. Normal entry into the G2/M checkpoint followed by defective exit is consistent with either defective DSB repair or checkpoint recovery.</p>

<p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we monitored the γ-H2AX histone modification found at DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Rogakou1">[23]</xref> by both Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). The γ-H2AX signal was lost 4–8 h after irradiation, whereas in singly and doubly depleted RSF1 and SNF2H cells, it persisted for at least 24 h. These data indirectly indicate a DSB repair defect in the absence of RSF1 and SNF2H. We then monitored DSBs directly using neutral comet assays to confirm this result directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g003">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). Comet tails, corresponding to broken DNA, that are detected immediately after IR were rapidly lost in control cells, indicative of DSB repair. These tails persist throughout the experiment in cells singly or doubly depleted for RSF1 and SNF2H. Essentially equivalent results were obtained by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Thus, both of these physical techniques confirmed defective DSB repair in RSF1- and SNF2H-depleted cells, consistent with our clonogenic survival, checkpoint, and γ-H2AX assays.</p>

However, the interaction between RSF1 and CENPA was independent of IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, we were unable to demonstrate a direct link between RSF1 and CENPA at DSBs.</p>

<p>As RSF1 is required for the stabilisation of CENPA into centromeric chromatin, we wondered if it could play a similar role for other centromeric proteins at DSBs. CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 are two additional centromeric proteins that are known to interact with FANCM and have also been localised to sites of laser-activated psoralen-induced ICLs in S-phase cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yan1">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, these two proteins form a tetrameric complex resembling the histone H3–H4 tetramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yang1">[25]</xref>. Depletion of either CENPS/MHF1 (resembling H3) or CENPX/MHF2 (resembling H4) has been shown to result in defective FANCM recruitment, defective FANCD2 and FANCI mono-ubiquitination, and defective resolution of ICLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Singh1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yan1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>We hypothesised that the role of RSF1 in response to IR-induced DNA damage could be the recruitment of the histone fold proteins CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 to nucleosomes or nucleosome-like structures that occur in the vicinity of DSBs. This in turn may lead to the recruitment and mono-ubiquitination of FANCI/FANCD2 at DSBs, which in turn contribute to effective repair of breaks. In support of this hypothesis, both FANCI and FANCD2 are known ATM substrates and required for DSB resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Matsuoka1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Roques1">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, our proteomic analysis of chicken Atm-interacting proteins also suggested a possible interaction with FancI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001856-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>RSF1 co-immunoprecipitates with activated ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and we confirmed this interaction in RSF1 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4A and 4C</xref>). Consistent with our recruitment hypothesis, RSF1 immunoprecipitates prepared from IR-treated cells contained the CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 proteins. We mapped the region of RSF1 that interacts with CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 <italic>in vitro</italic> using recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Both of these histone-related proteins interacted with the C-terminus of RSF1, which contains the sites of ATM-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2G</xref>). Interestingly, the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins also interacted with RSF1 after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, and consistent with the RSF1 protein being exclusively bound to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), it was primarily the “long” forms, known to be mono-ubiquitinated and chromatin retained forms of FANCD2 and FANCI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Taniguchi2">[27]</xref>, that co-immunoprecipitated with RSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4A and 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We determined the dependency of FANCD2 and FANCI recruitment and mono-ubiquitination upon RSF1 by chromatin fractionation in the presence and absence of RSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). In un-irradiated cells that contain RSF1, the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins can be found as both soluble and chromatin retained proteins, with the mono-ubiquitinated form being largely on the chromatin. After IR, both FANCD2 and FANCI are primarily mono-ubiquitinated and retained in the chromatin fraction in cells containing RSF1. However, upon depletion of RSF1, both chromatin recruitment and mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI are abrogated. Importantly, expression of FLAG-tagged mouse Rsf1 rescues FANCD2 foci and mono-ubiquitination when endogenous RSF1 is depleted, confirming the specificity of our depletion conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s004">Figure S4C and D</xref>). Also, using an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody, we could not localise mouse Rsf1 to IRIF, suggesting that either insufficient Rsf1 is localised to IRIFs to be detected or that the role of Rsf1 at DSBs is transient. Thus, RSF1 is required for efficient mono-ubiquitination and retention of FANCD2 and FANCI on damaged chromatin.</p>
<p>To address the sequence of RSF1-dependent molecular events, we repeated the RSF1 immunoprecipitation after depletion of either CENPS/MHF1 or CENPX/MHF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In the absence of these proteins, ATM could still be detected in RSF1 immunoprecipitates, indicating that CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 are not required for the ATM–RSF1 interaction. However, the interaction between RSF1 and FANCD2 and FANCI could not be detected after knockdown of either CENPS/MHF1 or CENPX/MHF2. Consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yan1">[14]</xref>, mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI was abrogated when either CENPS/MHF1 or CENPX/MHF2 were depleted. We also noticed that in these immunoprecipitation experiments, in the absence of CENPX/MHF2, some CENPS/MHF1 was still detected in the RSF1 immunoprecipitates but not vice versa. This suggests that the subunit of the CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 complex that interacts directly with RSF1 is CENPS/MHF1. A direct interaction between CENPS/MHF1 and RSF1 is consistent with CENPS/MHF1 being a histone fold protein that most resembles histone H3 protein and RSF being a chromatin remodelling complex that preferentially recognises histone H3 and the H3-like CENPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Perpelescu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus far, our data are consistent with DSB-dependent ATM kinase activity being required for an interaction between ATM and RSF1 on chromatin; RSF1 then recruits the CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 complex, which in turn recruits FANCD2 and FANCI. Of note, the role of RSF1 appears to be specific to DSBs, as sensitivity of RSF1-depleted cells to MMC is subtle and FAND2 foci after MMC treatment are unaffected by RSF1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s002">Figure S2D</xref>, H, and I).</p>

<title>RSF1 and CENPS/MHF1 Are Required for Both NHEJ and HR</title>
<p>To determine the specificity of RSF1 for either of the two major DSB repair pathways, NHEJ and HR, we initially performed clonogenic survival assays on cells depleted of RSF1 or CENPS/MHF1 and treated with ICRF-193 or Olaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). ICRF-193 is an inhibitor of topoisomerase 2 and generates DSBs that are repaired specifically by NHEJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Buonomo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Nakamura1">[29]</xref>, whereas Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor that prevents repair of single-strand breaks, resulting in DSBs in the S phase that are normally repaired by HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Senra1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Schlacher1">[31]</xref>. Both of these drugs resulted in sensitivity in both RSF1- and CENPS/MHF1-depleted cells. In order to have a more direct and robust quantification of the NHEJ and HR pathways, we utilised established NHEJ and HR assays that are based upon expression of a GFP reporter after induction of a site-specific DSB by the <italic>I-SceI</italic> endonuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Ogiwara1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Pierce1">[33]</xref>.

Intriguingly, we also noticed defective recruitment of CtIP to IRIF upon depletion of RSF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).

Note that our extraction protocol distinguishes between the more dynamic recruitment of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 to centromeres relative to their more stable recruitment to IRIFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s006">Figure S6A</xref> to D). Although RSF1-depleted cells are proficient for recruitment of ATM and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) into IRIF, as well as for γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) IRIF, they are deficient for CENPS/MHF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and CENPX/MHF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) IRIF. As expected, this then results in loss of FANCD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) and FANCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) IRIF. Quantification of cells with at least 10 foci revealed that although ATM, γ-H2AX, or 53BP1 IRIF were unaffected by RSF1 depletion, CENPS/MHF1, CENPX/MHF2, FANCD2, and FANCI foci were reduced 3–4-fold relative to the undepleted control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>

<p>The recruitment of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 into IRIF contrasts with our failure to observe CENPA in IRIF, despite the recruitment of CENPA to kinetochores being readily apparent although clearly distinct from CENPS/MHF1 or NBS1 at IRIF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s006">Figure S6G</xref>). In fact, depletion of CENPS/MHF1 does not disrupt kinetochore formation as assessed by CENPA recruitment, nor did it perturb mitotic arrest and release after nocodazole addition and removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s006">Figure S6H</xref>), suggesting that the residual levels of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 after knockdown are sufficient for their function at kinetochores. We also confirmed that CENPS/MHF1 and FANCI IRIF are mainly co-localised (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s006">Figure S6E</xref>). Next, we determined the dependence of FANCD2 and FANCI foci on CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2. Depletion of CENPS/MHF1 or CENPX/MHF2 results in loss of FANCD2 IRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g006">Figure 6F</xref>) and FANCI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001856.s006">Figure S6F</xref>). Thus, our immunofluorescence data are in agreement with our biochemical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and together suggest a hierarchical recruitment of these proteins to DSBs.</p>
<p>Together, our data suggest a novel role for RSF1 in DSB repair in which this chromatin remodelling activity is required for recruitment of the CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 histone fold proteins to the vicinity of IR-induced DNA lesions. These proteins are in turn required for both FANCD2–FANCI recruitment and their efficient mono-ubiquitination.</p>

<title>RSF1 Contributes to DSB Repair</title>
<p>The ATM–RSF1 interaction is dependent upon IR and has been observed in both chicken DT40 cells and human cell lines. Importantly, this interaction is also dependent upon the kinase activity of the ATM kinase, which is consistent with the previous identification of RSF1 as a substrate of the ATM kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Matsuoka1">[10]</xref>. Using GST–ATM fusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Khanna1">[36]</xref> we have mapped the region of ATM that interacts with RSF1 to the C-terminal FATC domain, a region also reported to interact with TRF1 in this assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Karlseder1">[37]</xref>. RSF1 depletion results in sensitivity to IR and MMS but only moderate sensitivity to MMC and UVC. A role in DSB repair was suggested by persistence of the γ-H2AX modification and the failure of RSF1-depleted cells to exit the G2/M checkpoint. We confirmed defective DSB repair using two physical techniques, the comet assay and pulse-field gel electrophoresis. Moreover, using assays specific to either direct end joining or homology-directed repair of induced DSBs, our results indicate that RSF1 is required for efficient DNA repair by either of these two mechanisms. Together, our data indicate that RSF1 is a new player in the DDR required for the efficient repair of DSBs.</p>

<title>RSF1 Is Required for the Ordered Recruitment of Centromeric and FA Factors onto Damaged Chromatin</title>
<p>Recent reports have shown that after DNA ICLs, two proteins, FANCM-interacting histone fold proteins 1 and 2 (MHF1 and MHF2), are recruited to these lesions, resulting in the stabilisation of FANCM and the subsequent recruitment and mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Singh1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yan1">[14]</xref>. Previously, these proteins had been implicated in centromere function and termed CENPS and CENPX, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Amano1">[38]</xref>. Structurally, CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 form a tetramer that resembles the histone H3–H4 tetramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>RSF1 is a chromatin-remodelling factor with ATPase activity required for the establishment of centromeric CENPA, which in turn is required for the subsequent localisation of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 to centromeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Perpelescu1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Amano1">[38]</xref>. This role led us to determine whether RSF1 might be required for the recruitment of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 to DSBs. RSF1 appears to specifically interact with CENPS/MHF1 as loss of CENPX/MHF2 does not abolish the RSF1 interaction with CENPS/MHF1, whereas loss of CENPS/MHF1 does abolish the interaction. This is also consistent with crystallographic studies indicating that although CENPS/MHF1 is not a histone variant, it is a histone fold protein that most closely resembles histone H3 and RSF1 is known to preferentially bind to histone H3 and CENPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Loyola1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Perpelescu1">[8]</xref>. Using GST–RSF1 fusion proteins and recombinant CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2, we have also demonstrated a direct interaction between RSF1 and these histone fold proteins. CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 interact with the C-terminus of RSF1, a region containing sites of <italic>in vivo</italic> ATM-dependent phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Importantly, using depletion of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2, we have also shown that these proteins are subsequently required for the recruitment and mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI at DSBs. Note that previous reports have also demonstrated FANCD2 and FANCI localization to DSBs produced during the S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Taniguchi1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Taniguchi2">[27]</xref>. Although there are connections between the FA pathway and replication-coupled, homology-directed DSB repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Kim1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Deans1">[18]</xref>, the precise role of activated FANCD2 and FANCI in DSB repair has not yet been characterised. However, it is likely that coordinated ubiquitination, which regulates recruitment of specific factors to the mono-ubiquitin moiety via a plethora of ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs), and de-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI are required for efficient repair.</p>
<p>A role for centromeric proteins in DSB repair has also been suggested by the reported localisation of CENPA to laser-induced and I-SceI–induced site-specific DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Zeitlin1">[24]</xref>. Unfortunately, under our experimental conditions we could not detect CENPA localisation to sites of IRIF, although its localisation to kinetochores was readily apparent. Nor could we detect an interaction between ATM and CENPA by either mass spectrometric analysis or by co-immunoprecipitation. However, we could detect RSF1, CENPS/MHF1, and CENPA in ATM immunoprecipitates prepared from cells treated with formaldehyde, an agent that crosslinks proteins that are in close proximity. Our data do not rule out a possible role for CENPA at DSBs. However, future studies will be required to determine the precise role of CENPA, if any, in DSB repair.</p>
<p>In summary, we have identified RSF1 as a new player in the DDR response that is required for repair of DSBs. Our data are consistent with a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001856-g007">Figure 7</xref>) in which DSB-activated ATM results in RSF-dependent recruitment of the CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 complex, which in turn is required to recruit and activate FANCD2 and FANCI. Although this sequence of events is not required for DSB-dependent checkpoint signalling, it is required for DSB repair, probably in constructing a chromatin environment permissive for repair. This is likely to be a highly dynamic process requiring transient complexes between DNA and CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 complexes.</p>

<title>ATM-dependent activation of the RSF complex facilitates DNA DSB repair.</title>
<p>Upon damage (step I) ATM is activated and recruited to chromatin containing a DSB (step II). One of the substrates of ATM is the RSF1 protein. Once activated by ATM-dependent phosphorylation of RSF1 (step III), we propose that the RSF chromatin-remodelling complex facilitates DSB repair utilising its translocase activity, via an ill-understood mechanism likely to involve nucleosome sliding (step III) and even nucleosome clearance (step IV). As part of this process, CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2, two histone-fold proteins, are recruited to the vicinity of the DSB in an RSF-dependent fashion (step V). As the CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 tetramer has fewer contacts with DNA than a nucleosome or the H3–H4 tetramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Yang1">[25]</xref>, it could perform a “<italic>placeholder</italic>” function, preventing DNA that has been unwound from nucleosomes on either side of the DSB from forming a random coil and also facilitating the subsequent access of DSB repair machineries. Downstream of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 recruitment, the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins are recruited and mono-ubiquitinated by a mechanism dependent upon prior recruitment of CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 (step 6). It is not know how many steps exist between CENPS/MHF1–CENPX/MHF2 and subsequent FANCD2–FANCI recruitment. Mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCI presumably functions as docking sites that regulate recruitment of subsequent DSB repair proteins, such as CtIP, which has functions in both NHEJ and HR.</p>

After an incubation (10 min/RT), electroporation was performed using a gene pulsar apparatus (Bio-rad, 550 V, 25 µF). Cells were then grown for two doubling times (approximately 16–24 h). The media was replaced with fresh RPMI media containing the required drug for selection, and the cells were aliquoted into 4× 96-well plates. When the clones grew big enough to be visible, they were transferred into 24-well plates (containing 1 ml of media in each well). Upon confluence they were split into 12-well dishes (4 ml in total), and once confluent, 2 ml was harvested and frozen at −80°C in freezing media (serum plus 10% DMSO) and 2 ml (∼1.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells) harvested for genomic DNA extraction.</p>

<title>Preparation of Samples for MS Analysis</title>
<p>Equal amounts of protein from unlabelled and labelled samples were combined prior to protein digestion. Briefly, samples were reduced in 10 mM DTT and alkylated in 50 mM Iodoacetamide prior to boiling in loading buffer, and then separated by 1D SDS-PAGE (4%–12% Bis-Tris Novex mini-gel, Invitrogen) and visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining (Novex, Invitrogen). The entire protein gel lanes were excised and cut into 10 slices each. Every gel slice was subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin overnight at 37°C. The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted by formic acid (1%) and acetonitrile, lyophilized in a speed-vac, and resuspended in 1% formic acid.</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p>Trypsin-digested peptides were separated using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC (Thermo Scientific) nano-flow LC system. On average 0.5 µg was loaded with a constant flow of 5 µl/min onto an Acclaim PepMap100 nano-Viper C18 trap column (100 µm inner-diameter, 2 cm; Thermo Scientific). After trap enrichment, peptides were eluted onto an Acclaim PepMap RSLC nano-Viper, C18 column (75 µm, 15 cm; ThermoScientific) with a linear gradient of 2%–40% solvent B (80% acetonitrile with 0.08% formic acid) over 65 min with a constant flow of 300 nl/min. The HPLC system was coupled to a linear ion trap Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Scientific) via a nano-electrospray ion source (Thermo Scientific). The spray voltage was set to 1.2 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 250°C. Full-scan MS survey spectra (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 335–1800) in profile mode were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 after accumulation of 1,000,000 ions. The 15 most intense peptide ions from the preview scan in the Orbitrap were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; and activation time, 10 ms) in the LTQ after the accumulation of 10,000 ions. Maximal filling times were 1,000 ms for the full scans and 150 ms for the MS/MS scans. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled, and all unassigned charge states as well as singly charged species were rejected. The lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001856-Olsen1">[39]</xref>. Data were acquired using the Xcalibur software.</p>

Enzyme specificity was set to that of trypsin, allowing for cleavage N-terminal to proline residues and between aspartic acid and proline residues. Other parameters used were as follows: (i) variable modifications, methionine oxidation, protein N-acetylation, gln → pyro-glu; (ii) fixed modifications, cysteine carbamidomethylation; (iii) database, target-decoy human MaxQuant (ipi.HUMAN.v3.68); (iv) heavy labels, R6K4 and R10K8; (v) MS/MS tolerance, FTMS, 10 ppm; ITMS, 0.6 Da; (vi) maximum peptide length, 6; (vii) maximum missed cleavages, 2; (viii) maximum of labelled amino acids, 3; and (ix) false discovery rate, 1%. Peptide ratios were calculated for each arginine- and/or lysine-containing peptide as the peak area of labelled arginine/lysine divided by the peak area of nonlabelled arginine/lysine for each single-scan mass spectrum. Peptide ratios for all arginine- and lysine-containing peptides sequenced for each protein were averaged.</p>
