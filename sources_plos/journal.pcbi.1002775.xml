      <abstract>
        <p>How interactions between neurons relate to tuned neural responses is a longstanding question in systems neuroscience. Here we use statistical modeling and simultaneous multi-electrode recordings to explore the relationship between these interactions and tuning curves in six different brain areas. We find that, in most cases, functional interactions between neurons provide an explanation of spiking that complements and, in some cases, surpasses the influence of canonical tuning curves. Modeling functional interactions improves both encoding and decoding accuracy by accounting for noise correlations and features of the external world that tuning curves fail to capture. In cortex, modeling coupling alone allows spikes to be predicted more accurately than tuning curve models based on external variables. These results suggest that statistical models of functional interactions between even relatively small numbers of neurons may provide a useful framework for examining neural coding.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The number of simultaneous neurons that electrophysiologists can record is growing rapidly, and a central goal of computational neuroscience is to develop statistical methods that can make sense of this growing data. Here we present a unified statistical analysis of 10 different datasets recorded from several different species and brain areas. We show how functional interactions between neurons may be used to predict spiking in each of these different areas, and find that, in many cases, modeling interactions between a small number of neurons yields better spike predictions than modeling each neuron's relationship to the outside world using tuning curves. Although these statistical results cannot be linked to specific network architectures, since the measured interactions between neurons are purely functional rather than anatomical, they suggest that modeling interactions between neurons will be a useful approach to understanding neural coding as electrophysiologists record from increasing numbers of neurons.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the central tenets of systems neuroscience is that the functional properties of neurons, such as receptive fields and tuning curves, arise from the inputs that each neuron receives from pre-synaptic neurons. Over the past few decades, a number of experimental techniques have been developed to study exactly how interactions between neurons determine receptive field structure, including <italic>in vivo</italic> intracellular or paired recording <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Ferster1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Wehr1">[6]</xref> and pharmacological or electrophysiological interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Wang1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Nelson1">[10]</xref>. As electrophysiologists record from increasing numbers of neurons simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Buzski1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Stevenson1">[13]</xref>, statistical approaches that estimate interactions between neurons have the potential to explain the functional properties of neurons as network effects using only passive spike observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Stevenson2">[for review see 14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To understand how interactions between neurons drive neural activity, recent model-based statistical methods attempt to predict the activity of each neuron based on the activity of other simultaneously observed neurons in addition to any external variables, such as the orientation of a visual stimulus or the direction of hand movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Paninski1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Chornoboy1">[19]</xref>. This type of inferential approach provides estimates of potential interactions between neurons and allows us to assess how much external variables or interactions between neurons may have contributed to the observed spiking. It is important to note that these models provide only an approximation to the true underlying network structure. Since the vast majority of pre-synaptic inputs to any given neuron are unobserved, the interactions that these approaches describe reflect many different factors including common input in addition to direct and indirect synaptic connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Stevenson2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Aertsen1">[20]</xref>. However, due to the fact that neurons are not independent, these models can improve both encoding accuracy (how well neural responses can be predicted) as well as decoding accuracy (how well external variables can be predicted from neural responses).</p>
      <p>Statistical models of interactions between neurons have been used to describe many different aspects of multi-electrode data in retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Pillow2">[21]</xref>, LGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Babadi1">[22]</xref>, primary visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Kelly1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Gerhard1">[24]</xref>, motor cortices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Truccolo1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Truccolo2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Stevenson3">[26]</xref>, and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Harris1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Okatan1">[28]</xref>. Here we present a unified analysis of data from six different brain areas with a particular view towards three questions: 1) How are estimated interactions between neurons related to apparent tuning properties?, 2) How do traditional tuning curve models change as interactions between neurons are included in the model? and 3) How does our ability to predict and decode neural activity improve as increasing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons are observed?</p>
      <p>To make our analysis as broad as possible, we collected ten multi-electrode spike train datasets with at least 30 simultaneously recorded neurons. Datasets were obtained from six different brain areas across four different species performing a variety of tasks. By modeling typical tuning curves for neurons in each area as well as interactions between neurons we determine how much these two factors contribute to spike prediction. We find that including information about the activity of other observed neurons improves both spike prediction and decoding accuracy substantially. By capturing noise correlations and unmodeled features of the external world models of interactions between even a relatively small number of recorded neurons can complement and, in some cases, surpass, models of tuning curves alone.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Although neurons are often characterized by how their firing rate relates to external stimuli or movement variables, the functional properties of most neurons are byproducts of the input they receive from other neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). By modeling typical tuning curves as well as coupling between neurons we aim to determine how well each of these factors explains spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). We fit three, time-instantaneous, generalized linear models (GLMs) to recorded spike trains from 10 different datasets and attempt to predict spiking given: 1) external variables, 2) the activity of other observed neurons, or 3) both external variables and the activity of other observed neurons. After fitting these models to spike data the estimated parameters correspond to a typical tuning curve model, a phenomenological model of interactions between neurons, and a full model that allows functional interactions between neurons to provide an alternative explanation for the spiking that is traditionally attributed to tuning to external variables (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

          <p>A) Schematic illustrating how tuning properties may be related to functional connectivity. The tuning properties of observed neurons (black) are a direct result of input they receive from peripheral neurons (blue and red). Even when observed neurons do not have a direct relationship to external variables, each neuron may have apparent tuning caused by the input it receives from peripheral neurons and shaped by interactions with other observed neurons. B) A linear-nonlinear-Poisson model that includes both tuning properties as well as interactions or coupling between neurons. The firing rate of each neuron is modeled as a weighted sum of external variables as well as the activities of other observed neurons passed through an exponential nonlinearity. C) A toy example where tuning properties are explained away using coupling. In two simulated networks only neuron 1 is directly related to the external world (with Gaussian tuning). However, neurons 2 and 3 have tuning due to the input they receive from neuron 1 (middle). If these interactions are estimated, then coupling can fully explain the observed tuning (bottom).</p>

      <p>Tuning curves can be “explained away” if the other observed neurons provide a better explanation for spiking than the external variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). For instance, in a toy network where neuron 1 is tuned to external variables and projects to neurons 2 and 3. Neurons 2 and 3 will appear tuned, despite having no direct relationship to the external world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, middle). By using the activity of neuron 1 to predict the spiking of neurons 2 and 3, the tuning properties can be explained away by the more direct interactions between neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, bottom). Apparent tuning can appear in any number of network configurations, but given a set of simultaneously recorded neurons the models used here aim to explain spiking as directly as possible. In physiological data, it is unlikely that we are recording from synaptically connected pairs of neurons. The estimated couplings that we observe are likely to be strongly influenced by common input from outside of the recording area and do not necessarily reflect local, recurrent effects. However, tuning curves can still be “explained away” if the activity of the other observed neurons allows better spike prediction.</p>

      <p>To quantify how coupling in the full model relates to tuning properties we measured the overlap between tuning curves for each pair of neurons in each dataset using the angle between the tuning curve parameter vectors (cosine similarity). An overlap of zero corresponds to orthogonal tuning (i.e. cosine tuned neurons with preferred directions of 0 and 90 deg), an overlap of one corresponds to identical tuning, and an overlap of negative one corresponds to exactly opposite tuning (i.e. cosine tuned neurons with preferred directions of 0 and 180 degrees). We find that tuning curve overlap is clearly related to the bulk spike-count correlation across all stimulus/movement conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, coupling strength is only indirectly related to tuning curve overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Two neurons having similar tuning curves will not necessarily have strong coupling in the full model. This suggests that the explaining away of tuning curves by coupling is not a straight-forward byproduct of stimulus correlation and that including other observed neurons in spike prediction provides information that is not present in the tuning curves alone.</p>
      <p>The structure of the coupling terms, particularly the number of connections that each neuron makes with the other observed neurons (the “degree”) provides some insight into how tuning curves are explained away. In contrast to theories of scale-free neural connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Sporns1">[29]</xref> – which predict power-law degree distributions – the estimated functional interactions in these datasets, under the full model, have uni-modal degree distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, across all datasets, it seems that out-degree (how many outputs a neuron drives) is more narrowly distributed than in-degree (how many inputs a neuron receives). The exact structure of the functional connectivity graphs may be affected by electrode spacing and geometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Gerhard1">[24]</xref>. However, in-degree is correlated with how well coupling can explain tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In general, neurons whose tuning curves are well explained by coupling receive input from more neurons compared to neurons whose tuning curves are not well explained by coupling.</p>

      <p>How these models behave as the number of simultaneously recorded neurons grows is an important consideration for future modeling. Here we fit the coupling alone and the full model, varying the number of neurons used to predict spikes. Under the full model, we find that, in good approximation, the fraction of variance explained by tuning decreases logarithmically as the number of observed neurons increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Place fields in hippocampus are explained away slowly, while tuning curves in motor and sensory cortices are explained more rapidly. In general, 10–70% of the variance initially attributed to tuning curves is explained by coupling between neurons in the full model.</p>

      <p>A second metric for studying how these methods scale with the number of observed neurons is spike prediction accuracy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). As the number of neurons included in the model increases we find that spike prediction accuracy scales, to a good approximation, hyperbolically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Note that the full model begins providing the same accuracy as the tuning curve model. As more neurons are included in the model, spike prediction accuracy increases and appears to converge towards a maximum. Interestingly, modeling coupling alone shows this same hyperbolic behavior, beginning at zero and converging towards a maximum. Once 10–30 neurons are included in the model, coupling alone provides more accurate spike prediction that traditional tuning curve models in most datasets.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Hippocampal neurons appear to differ from cortical recordings in that spike prediction accuracy increases approximately linearly. Moreover, modeling coupling alone does not provide more accurate spike prediction than the basic place field model. This may be due to the low correlations between HC neurons. Electrode spacing may also be a factor, since, unlike the 400 µm electrode spacing used in almost all of the intra-cortical arrays, HC recordings had 20 µm vertical electrode spacing. However, the coupling model for spontaneous activity in V1 shows the same hyperbolic behavior despite data being recorded using a polytrode with 50 µm electrode spacing. Scaling of spike prediction accuracy in hippocampus appears to be qualitatively different from that in cortex.</p>
      <p>In addition to examining how encoding accuracy scales with the number of recorded neurons, we also examined decoding accuracy for several datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). For the V1, M1, and PMd datasets, we infer which of eight different reach targets or stimuli was presented given the observed spiking on a given trial. Here we use Bayesian decoding under either the tuning curve encoding models or the full encoding model described above (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details). As with spike prediction accuracy, decoding accuracy grows approximately hyperbolically as more neurons are included in the models. Including coupling between neurons in addition to tuning improves decoding by a small but significant amount: 4.8±0.3%, 7.8±0.4%, 10.3±0.4%, and 7.9±0.3% for the two M1 datasets, PMd, and V1, respectively. Many studies have illustrated how dependencies between neurons can reduce decoding accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Averbeck1">[30]</xref>. By simulating from the tuning curve model we can examine how well we could decode external variables if the neurons were conditionally independent. In this case, decoding from such an independent population of neurons would be ∼25% more accurate than decoding the observed data with the tuning curve model.</p>
      <p>It is important to consider what factors may be driving these scaling phenomena. Although the coupling terms are regularized during estimation and the spike prediction accuracy is cross-validated, it may be the case that tuning curves are explained away as a result of over-fitting or, alternatively, as a simple side effect of stimulus correlations. To test for this possibility we simulated spike counts from the tuning curve model, where the neurons are conditionally independent given the external variables. That is, although there may be stimulus correlations, spiking can be completely predicted by external variables. Here we find that no matter how many neurons are included in the full model, tuning explains between 90–100% of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). This suggests that the results for the full model in real data are not driven by over-fitting or stimulus correlation alone.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Additionally, we can quantify how much stimulus correlation contributes to explaining away by shuffling the data to remove noise correlations. Where possible (M1, PMd, and V1) we shuffle the spike counts within each trial condition (target or grating direction) independently for each neuron. This manipulation retains stimulus correlations while destroying any structure unrelated to the stimulus. Here we find that, in the full model, tuning explains between 85–95% of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Furthermore, the spike prediction accuracies of the full and coupling models do not exceed the accuracy of the tuning curve model in shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). These two controls demonstrate that the observed explaining away is not simply a byproduct of stimulus correlations or of a poor tuning curve model. Explaining away can only occur when the other observed neurons provide a more direct explanation of spiking than the external variables.</p>
      <p>Finally, to examine what drives the shape of these spike prediction accuracy curves we simulated a linear-nonlinear-Poisson neuron receiving sparse, correlated input. As input correlation increases spike prediction accuracy converges more quickly to its maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). When the inputs are strongly correlated, neurons added later are only providing redundant information. However, when the inputs are independent, each additional neuron contributes to more accurate spike prediction. If the inputs are sparse and some of them are irrelevant to the prediction, information added by each neuron is simply smaller on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). That is, if only 10% of the inputs are non-zero then it takes 10 times as many neurons to reach a given spike prediction accuracy compared to the case where all of the inputs were non-zero.

      <p>Linking the strength of common input and sparseness to the spike prediction accuracy curves observed in real data is difficult. Both a weakly correlated, highly connected network and a highly correlated, highly sparse network will have near-linear growth. However, here we find that neurons in cortex (particularly V1 and A1) tend to be more strongly correlated than neurons in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002775-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This may partially explain the rapid growth in spike prediction accuracy for the cortical datasets and, in comparison, the near-linear growth for hippocampal datasets. Especially in cortex, the fact that neural activity traditionally attributed to tuning curves is more directly explained by interactions between neurons appears to be a byproduct of unobserved common input.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Excepting peripheral neurons such as photoreceptors, the relationship between a neuron's spiking and the external world is a result of the input that each neuron receives from other neurons. Many studies have examined how pre-synaptic input determines receptive field structure and tuning properties both experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Ferster1">[e.g. 1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Lampl1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Martinez1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Hirsch1">[5]</xref> and theoretically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Moser1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Somers1">[33]</xref>. Here we have used multi-electrode recordings and statistical modeling to examine, broadly, how tuning curves might be explained, in a statistical sense, by functional interactions between neurons. We have found that, in a variety of brain areas, modeling coupling between a relatively small number of simultaneously observed neurons in the same brain area allows more accurate encoding and decoding. As the number of observed neurons grows the fraction of spiking variability attributed to tuning appears to decrease logarithmically, while spike prediction accuracy increases hyperbolically. Once interactions between 10–30 neurons are modeled, coupling alone can often provide more accurate spike prediction than traditional tuning models.</p>
      <p>The extent to which the activity of simultaneously observed neurons or tuning properties explain spiking likely depends on a number of factors including the timescales on which we model spiking, the stimulus or task parameters, and the external variables being used to describe tuning. The coarse, instantaneous coupling models used here cannot distinguish between the many possible hidden causes of correlated neural activity. Since the models used here reflect pair-wise dependencies on a long timescale of 100 s of milliseconds, it is likely that unobserved behavioral variables and internal processes make strong contributions to the coupling terms. Modeling these effects explicitly may yield a more nuanced view of the relationship between tuning curves and interactions between neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Kelly1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Chase1">[34]</xref>. Although we model trial-by-trial spike-count data here, both tuning and coupling can also be modeled as history-dependent effects. Since external variables change fairly slowly, whereas interactions between neurons are likely to be relatively fast, adding such temporal information may result in qualitatively different results. More detailed models that include history-dependent coupling on millisecond timescales may be able to further unpack the functional roles of recurrent, local coupling and instantaneous common input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Vidne1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The datasets used here yield surprisingly similar results considering that they were recorded from different brain areas and species with different electrode configurations. However, in addition to these anatomical differences, it is important to note that the datasets were recorded under a variety of experimental circumstances, which may help to explain some of the remaining differences in the results obtained from each dataset. For data from motor cortices and hippocampus, for instance, the external variables are not controlled in the same way that sensory experiments are. Movement variables such as velocity or body orientation differ even when the monkey's reaches to the same target or when the rat is at the same maze location. These external differences may lead to higher apparent trial-to-trial variability. Additionally, data from V1 was recorded while the animals were under anesthesia, which may lead to higher correlations between neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Greenberg1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Ecker1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The tuning models used here, despite their wide-spread use, are relatively simplistic. Tuning functions that take into account more external variables are likely to give more accurate spike prediction, and including these variables may change the degree to which tuning properties are explained away as interactions between neurons are added to the model. At the same time, exploring the space of external variables and determining what causes a neuron to fire can be difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Arcas1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Wu1">[41]</xref>. Fitting tuning functions to neurons in medial temporal lobe, for instance, might require exploring the space of all possible objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Quiroga1">[42]</xref>. Fitting high-dimensional tuning functions, in general, can require large amounts of data as well as sophisticated estimation methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Sahani1">[43]</xref>. Rather than exploring the space of external variables, exploring the statistical structure of interactions between neurons may be an alternative strategy for understanding tuning properties.</p>

        <title>The unreasonable effectiveness of small numbers of neurons</title>

Many studies have examined correlated neural activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Ecker1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Smith1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Kohn1">[48]</xref> as well as its potential functional roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Averbeck1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Renart1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Schneidman1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Kohn2">[50]</xref>. Here correlations between neurons are essential in allowing tuning properties to be explained away by the functional interactions between small numbers of neurons. However, the fact that coupling terms do not explain away tuning curves in simulated or shuffled data, suggests that our results are not simply a byproduct of stimulus correlation. Rather, the estimated coupling between neurons is likely to reflect a combination of direct and indirect interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Dragoi1">[e.g. 51]</xref> as well as additional unobserved common input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Stevenson2">[14]</xref> and internal processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Pastalkova1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Canolty1">[54]</xref>. Several studies have made progress in attempting to infer unobserved common input related to the external world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Chase1">[34]</xref> as well as internal processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Vidne1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Kulkarni1">[55]</xref>. Here we simply note that unobserved common input may allow more accurate spike prediction in models of interacting neurons by creating correlations that cannot be attributed to the observed external variables. Modeling these dependencies improves decoding by a small, but significant, amount and may be useful for improving brain-machine interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Schwartz1">[56]</xref>. Moreover, the correlations induced by unobserved common input appear to allow neural activity traditionally attributed to tuning properties to be more directly explained by interactions between neurons.</p>
        <p>It is important to note, however, that the statistical approaches used here are unlikely to capture anatomical information about the underlying circuitry. These methods still only provide a sketch of the underlying circuit that best explains the observed spiking. The hyperbolic scaling of spike prediction accuracy observed here, for instance, may be a general property of correlated prediction problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Wessberg1">[57]</xref>. found a similar hyperbolic scaling in accuracy using the firing rates of neurons in motor cortex for linear prediction of hand position.</p>

        <title>Towards a description of tuning properties based on network architecture</title>
        <p>For many years, studies of the relationship between neural interactions and tuning properties have been based on detailed electrophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Hartline1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Hubel1">[59]</xref>, experimental intervention , or simulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-BenYishai1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Bienenstock1">[60]</xref>. Most of these studies have addressed data collected in sensory cortices or peripheral areas. However, understanding the response properties of neurons in other areas, such as motor and association cortices, in terms of neural circuits has been difficult. Here we used simultaneous neural recordings and a model-based statistical approach to ask how well tuning properties can be explained, in a statistical sense, by functional interactions between neurons. While these models are able to explain a surprisingly large fraction of the variation in neural spike counts in a variety of brain areas with a relatively small number of observed neurons, they only provide a rough picture of how network <italic>architecture</italic> might give rise to commonly observed tuning properties.</p>
        <p>Understanding how interactions between neurons give rise to tuning properties, will ultimately mean understanding the relative contributions of feed-forward, local, and top-down pre-synaptic inputs, as well as how different subtypes of neurons and neurons with different types of tuning interact. One area where statistical approaches have revealed this type of detailed architecture is in the retina. By recording from dense populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), recent work has shown that RGC receptive fields arise directly and clearly from input received from rods and cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Field1">[61]</xref>. Moreover, functional interactions between retinal ganglion cells appear to have a strong, local structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Pillow2">[21]</xref>. Although photoreceptors are the only elements in the retinal circuit that have direct responses to the external world, the receptive fields of RGC responses can be understood as a byproduct of indirect interactions with photoreceptors, mediated by intermediate neurons, such as horizontal, amacrine, and bipolar cells.</p>
        <p>In most areas of the brain, beyond the retina, recording from a complete neural circuit is experimentally infeasible and the complete network of neurons is immensely under-sampled. In these cases, it is difficult to determine whether potential interactions between neurons are direct (mono-synaptic) or indirect (poly-synaptic), and the estimated interactions are likely to be strongly influenced by unobserved common input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Stevenson2">[14]</xref>. What is ultimately estimated by the statistical approaches is a phenomenological model of the circuitry that best describes the observed spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Aertsen1">[20]</xref>. For this reason it is difficult to draw conclusions about detailed architecture in current multi-electrode datasets. Here we have examined how modeling interactions between small numbers affects neural coding and how model-based estimates of interactions relate to stimulus and noise correlation. As electrophysiologists record from increasing numbers of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Stevenson1">[13]</xref> these approaches have the potential to reveal more detailed information about the structure of these cortical and sub-cortical areas.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We analyzed 10 multi-electrode spike datasets recorded from 6 different brain areas and 4 different species. Recordings from primary (M1) and dorsal pre-motor cortex (PMd) were made while a macaque monkey performed a center-out reaching task. Recordings from primary sensory cortex (S1) were made while a macaque monkey performed a random-target pursuit task. Recordings from primary auditory cortex (A1) were made while a ferret was exposed to random frequency tone stimuli. Data from primary visual cortex (V1) consisted of recordings of 1) evoked activity while an anesthetized monkey viewed randomly oriented moving gratings and 2) spontaneous activity from an anesthetized, paralyzed cat. Finally, recordings from dorsal hippocampus (HC) were made while a Long-Evans rat was freely foraging for food on a square platform.</p>
      <p>All animal use procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committees at Northwestern University (M1 &amp; S1), University of Chicago (M1 &amp; PMd), Albert Einstein College of Medicine (V1), University of Maryland College Park (A1), University of British Columbia (V1 spont), or Rutgers University (HC) , and conform to the principles outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication no. 86-23, revised 1985). Data presented here were previously recorded for use with multiple analyses. Procedures were designed to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number used.</p>
      <p>The aim of our analysis was to examine the relationship between typical tuning curves and receptive fields in each of these brain areas and coupling between neurons. To this end we extracted spike count data from the spike-sorted multi-electrode recordings and focused either on evoked responses for the stimulus and directed movement tasks or binned responses for the foraging and spontaneous tasks. Each dataset contained at least 31 and as many as 107 simultaneously recorded, putative single neurons after spike sorting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002775-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

          <title>Recordings from primary and pre-motor cortex</title>
          <p>Datasets were obtained from the motor cortices of two monkeys (designated K and R). Monkey K was implanted with a 100-electrode Utah array (Blackrock Microsystems, 400 µm spacing, 1.5 mm length) in the arm area of primary motor cortex. Data were recorded during two different tasks: a standard eight-target center-out reaching task, and an isometric eight-target center-out wrist force task. In the first task the monkey was seated in a primate chair, with movement constrained to a horizontal plane, with the arm roughly in a sagittal plane. The monkey grasped the handle of a two link planar manipulandum that moved within a 20 cm by 20 cm workspace. In the second task the monkey used isometric forces about the wrist (with the forearm in a posture midway between pronation and supination) to produce center-out forces. In both tasks feedback about movement or force was given on a computer screen in front of the monkey, displayed as a circular cursor, 1–2 cm diameter. The recordings were made approximately 4 months apart with 87 well isolated single-units recorded during the center-out reaching task and 101 units recorded during the center-out wrist-force task after offline spike-sorting. Trial-by-trial spike counts were collected during the period 100–300 ms following movement onset on 209 and 193 trials, respectively.</p>
          <p>For Monkey R, two 100-electrode Utah arrays (Blackrock Microsystems) were implanted in dorsal pre-motor and primary motor cortices. Data were recorded while the monkey performed a randomized, eight-target, center-out reaching task using a KINARM device (BKIN Technologies, Kingston, ON, Canada) in which the monkey's arm rested on cushioned troughs secured to links of a two-joint robotic arm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Scott1">[62]</xref>. After spike-sorting, 78 well isolated single-units were recorded in M1 with 65 well isolated single-units in PMd. Data from M1 and PMd are treated separately here, and trial-by-trial spike counts were collected during the period 100–300 ms following movement onset from 315 trials. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Hatsopoulos1">[63]</xref> for surgical, stimulus, and preprocessing details.</p>
          <p>In each of the M1 and PMd datasets neuronal signals were classified as single- or multi-unit based on action potential shape and minimum inter-spike intervals greater than 1.6 ms. Spike sorting was performed by manual cluster cutting using an offline sorter (Plexon, Inc). All trials for the center-out tasks began with the acquisition of a square center target that the monkey was required to hold for 0.3–0.5 s. Subjects had 1.25 s to acquire the peripheral target and were required to hold this outer target for at least 0.2–0.5 s. Each success was rewarded with juice or water.</p>

The estimated firing rate for each neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then a function of the external variables during each trial <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the activity of the other neurons <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes one of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> basis functions that describe the shape of the tuning curve, and the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> capture tuning, coupling to other neurons, and a baseline firing rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The basis functions, described below, will depend on the brain area we are trying to model and the stimulus/task. The spike count is then assumed to be drawn from a Poisson distribution with this rate:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e015"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the spike count for neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on trial <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>Using this same framework, tuning curves alone were modeled by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e019"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>while coupling between neurons was modeled by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e020"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Note that, for the coupling model, the spike count for the neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> whose firing rate we are estimating was always excluded. Using this framework we examined the effect of network size on spike prediction accuracy by varying the total number of neurons included in the model and using a random subset of all recorded neurons, again excluding neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>For each of these three models – the full model, tuning curve model, and coupling model – we estimated the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> directly from the observed spike count data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or maximum <italic>a posteriori</italic> (MAP) estimation with an L1-penalty to prevent over-fitting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Pillow2">[see 21]</xref>. Here we compute ML estimates using iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) with the Matlab package <italic>glmfit</italic> and compute MAP estimates using path-wise, cyclical coordinate descent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Friedman1">[72]</xref> with the R package <italic>glmnet</italic>.</p>
        <p>Where regularization is used we optimized the regularization hyperparameter via the cross-validated (10-fold) log-likelihood, and in all cases we evaluated the “spike prediction accuracy” of the models using the cross-validated log likelihood ratio relative to a homogeneous Poisson process. For a firing rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the log-likelihood is given by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e026"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and the log likelihood ratio relative to a homogeneous Poisson process (spike prediction accuracy) is given by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e027"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>In this case, a spike prediction accuracy of zero corresponds to a model that does no better than predicting the mean spike count. Values were calculated in base-2 and rescaled by time to give units of bits/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Pillow2">[see 21,27]</xref>. We find that spike prediction accuracy scales approximately hyperbolically, following <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of neurons in the model and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are parameters determining the shape of the curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Wessberg1">[see 57]</xref>.</p>
        <p>An important component of these models is the choice of basis functions for the external variables. Here we have attempted to choose common tuning models, appropriate for each dataset. For M1 and PMd neurons, for instance,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e032"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the target direction on each center-out trial. This linear component of the model corresponds to the traditional cosine tuning models of motor cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Amirikian1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Georgopoulos1">[74]</xref>. We used the same model to capture direction tuning in visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Swindale1">[75]</xref>.</p>
        <p>While activity in M1 has also been shown to covary with speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Moran1">[76]</xref>, we elected to use the simpler direction tuning model here, and model speed tuning only in S1 neurons, which show direction tuning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Prudhomme1">[77]</xref> as well as clear tuning to hand speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Weber1">[64]</xref>. In this case we use<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e034"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Place fields of the neurons in hippocampus have been well described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Wilson1">[78]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-McNaughton1">[80]</xref>. To model these localized response properties we use a set of radial basis functions that tile the foraging area.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e035"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Specifically we use K = 25 isotropic Gaussian radial basis functions equally spaced on a 5×5 grid with means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and covariance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 9 cm.</p>
        <p>Finally, for neurons in A1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Phillips1">[81]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Bizley1">[83]</xref>, we again use radial basis functions. In this case K = 7 Gaussians were equally spaced along the log-frequency of the stimulus with standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.64 octaves.</p>
        <p>In most cases (TC dimensionality &lt;4), regularization was only applied to the coefficients modeling coupling between neurons. To avoid convergence problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Zhao1">[84]</xref> the models using radial basis functions (A1 and HC) included weak regularization on the tuning curve coefficients (with 20% of the L1-penalty used for the coupling coefficients). The tuning curve parameters do not change substantially for penalties ranging from 1–20%; however, there may be unintended shrinkage in these models, and the decrease in modulation observed for these neurons may be somewhat over-estimated.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the models used here differ from previous approaches in that they are time-instantaneous — we model coupling between neurons at the same time. This does not pose any difficulties during fitting, since we are modeling only the conditional distributions for each neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, simulating from the joint spiking distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is no longer straight-forward. The usual assumption, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, does not hold, but, since the conditionals are know, we can use Gibb's sampling to simulate from this joint distribution if necessary (see section on Decoding below).</p>
        <p>To quantify the changes in tuning under the full model we evaluate the tuning modulation, tuning preference, and tuning curve overlap between pairs of neurons. Tuning modulation is simply the peak-to-peak difference in firing rate for the tuning curve component of the model, reported in Hz. Tuning preference is defined differently for each dataset: for M1, V1, PMd, and S1 we use the preferred direction, for A1 we use the preferred frequency, and for HC we use the preferred place along the x-axis. Finally, to measure similarity between the tuning curves for pairs of neurons we evaluate the tuning curve overlap between neurons <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Accordingly, a tuning curve overlap of 1 suggests that the two neurons have identical tuning (up to a constant baseline), while a tuning curve overlap of 0 suggests that the two neurons have orthogonal tuning.</p>
        <p>To quantify network properties we also report the spike count correlation (Pearson's correlation). For two neurons with trial-by-trial spike count observations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the correlation is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Although the spike count correlation between pairs of neurons is known to increase with both firing rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-deLaRocha1">[85]</xref> and time interval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Kass1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Reich1">[87]</xref>, we do not attempt to correct for these effects here. In most cases the bin-size is determined by the task and the traditional periods used to measure tuning curves, such as stimulus duration.</p>
        <p>To quantify the relative contributions of the tuning curve and coupling components in the full model we summarize the fit using the fraction of variance explained by tuning. For each neuron we calculate<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e049"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>A value of 1 suggests that the coupling terms provide no additional information, while a value of 0 suggests that any tuning information is explained completely by coupling to other observed neurons. It is important to note that there is considerable heterogeneity in how well tuned neurons are to the external variables. Here we analyze all recorded neurons, even those that might be considered un-tuned.</p>

        <title>Decoding</title>
        <p>In contrast to the encoding models above, which aim to predict spikes given a stimulus, we can also examine how coupling affects decoding, which aims to predict a stimulus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> given a set of spike observations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here, we use Bayesian decoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Quiroga2">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Nirenberg1">[89]</xref> based on the same encoding models described above. Assuming the stimuli are equally probable<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e052"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>For the tuning curve models, we assume that the neurons are conditionally independent given the stimulus,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e053"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>However, for the full model, since we assume that coupling is instantaneous, we cannot make this assumption. In this case we use a variation of Gibb's sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-MacKay1">[90]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Geman1">[92]</xref> to approximate the joint distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Briefly, in Gibbs sampling we generate samples from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by iterating over all neurons and sampling a spike count for each neuron based on the conditional distribution<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e056"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the iteration. Here we use a method know as ordered over-relaxation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002775-Neal1">[93]</xref> to improve mixing. This makes the sampler much more efficient for large networks of neurons with strong coupling. In this case we generate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> samples from the conditional distribution at each update, sort the samples along with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th largest value we take the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th sample. After many iterations the set of samples - ignoring a burn-in period - provides an approximation to the joint likelihood that we can then use, via Bayes rule, to approximate the posterior over possible stimuli.</p>
        <p>For each model we initialize the sampler with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, initialize each successive sample using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and update the spike counts <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each neuron in a random order using the conditional distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with ordered over-relaxation. We then take 5000 samples after a burn-in period of 500 samples to use as an approximation to the joint density.</p>
        <p>In practice, it is non-trivial to estimate the probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each trial given a set of samples from the distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When the number of neurons become large the curse of dimensionality makes histogram estimation impossible. We would need <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> samples where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of neurons to construct an accurate histogram. Here we use an approximation based on the chain rule of probability<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e071"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Although we cannot write down the full joint probability analytically, we can approximate each of the marginal distributions in the chain rule using the set of Gibbs samples<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002775.e072"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the random variables for all other neurons not yet taking a specific value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the expectations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002775.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are taken over the set of Gibbs samples. Importantly, each probability in each expectation can now be evaluated analytically based on the conditional Poisson likelihoods of the full model. This approach allows us to approximate the posterior over stimuli and assess the Bayesian decoding accuracy of the tuning curve model with instantaneous coupling.</p>
