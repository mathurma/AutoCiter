<abstract>
<p>Branching morphogenesis of the epithelial ureteric bud forms the renal collecting duct system and is critical for normal nephron number, while low nephron number is implicated in hypertension and renal disease. Ureteric bud growth and branching requires GDNF signaling from the surrounding mesenchyme to cells at the ureteric bud tips, via the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase and coreceptor Gfrα1; Ret signaling up-regulates transcription factors Etv4 and Etv5, which are also critical for branching. Despite extensive knowledge of the genetic control of these events, it is not understood, at the cellular level, how renal branching morphogenesis is achieved or how Ret signaling influences epithelial cell behaviors to promote this process. Analysis of chimeric embryos previously suggested a role for Ret signaling in promoting cell rearrangements in the nephric duct, but this method was unsuited to study individual cell behaviors during ureteric bud branching. Here, we use Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM), combined with organ culture and time-lapse imaging, to trace the movements and divisions of individual ureteric bud tip cells. We first examine wild-type clones and then <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> mutant/wild-type clones in which the mutant and wild-type sister cells are differentially and heritably marked by green and red fluorescent proteins. We find that, in normal kidneys, most individual tip cells behave as self-renewing progenitors, some of whose progeny remain at the tips while others populate the growing UB trunks. In <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> MADM clones, the wild-type cells generated at a UB tip are much more likely to remain at, or move to, the new tips during branching and elongation, while their <italic>Ret−/− or Etv4−/−</italic> sister cells tend to lag behind and contribute only to the trunks. By tracking successive mitoses in a cell lineage, we find that <italic>Ret</italic> signaling has little effect on proliferation, in contrast to its effects on cell movement. Our results show that Ret/Etv4 signaling promotes directed cell movements in the ureteric bud tips, and suggest a model in which these cell movements mediate branching morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During kidney development, the growth and repeated branching of an epithelial tube, the ureteric bud, generates the tree-like collecting duct system. In humans, defects in these processes cause congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract. While many of the genes that control these events are known (such as the signaling receptor <italic>Ret</italic> and the transcription factor <italic>Etv4</italic>), the cellular mechanisms underlying ureteric bud branching remain unclear. By time-lapse microscopy of mouse fetal kidneys developing in culture, in which individual ureteric bud cells are fluorescently labeled, we show that most cells at the tips behave as progenitors, some of whose daughters remain at the tips while others populate the tubular uretic bud trunks. We then use Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers, a genetic method that generates pairs of mutant and wild type cells, each labeled with a different fluorescent protein. We compare the behaviors of the mutant or wild-type ureteric bud cells by time-lapse microscopy of organ development in culture and by examining their numbers and spatial distribution after kidney development in vivo. The results reveal that <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> promote epithelial cell movements within the branching ureteric bud tips and suggest a model in which such cell movements mediate branching.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kidney development begins with the outgrowth of the primary ureteric bud (UB) from the nephric duct into the adjacent metanephric mesenchyme. The UB then bifurcates repeatedly during fetal development, generating ~10<sup>4</sup> terminal branches (in mouse) that connect to nephrons, the renal filtering units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref003">3</xref>]. Normal UB growth and branching is essential for the development of a full complement of nephrons, and low nephron number is thought to be a risk factor for development of hypertension and chronic kidney disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>A key stimulus of UB branching morphogenesis is the secreted protein GDNF, which signals via the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret and coreceptor Gfrα-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref006">6</xref>]. <italic>Gdnf</italic> is expressed initially by the metanephric mesenchyme cells, and then by the nephron progenitor cells (also known as “cap mesenchyme”) that surround each UB tip throughout kidney development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref011">11</xref>]. <italic>Ret</italic> is expressed by cells throughout the terminal UB “tips”, but not by cells in the “trunks” (the tubular portions behind the tips that elongate, narrow, and differentiate to form the collecting ducts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref012">12</xref>]; <italic>Gfra1</italic> is expressed in both cap mesenchyme and UB tip cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref015">15</xref>]. In mice lacking any of these genes, the UB usually fails to form, causing renal agenesis, or else branches minimally, causing severe renal hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref016">16</xref>]. Mutations in these genes are also sometimes associated with renal agenesis or other congenital defects of the kidney or urinary tract in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref017">17</xref>]. While the requirement for GDNF, and for several other signals (including fibroblast growth factors [FGFs], Wnts, and bone morphogenetic proteins [BMPs]), to achieve the normal extent and pattern of renal branching (and, indirectly, nephron number) is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref018">18</xref>], the specific cellular behaviors controlled by these signals, and how these behaviors contribute to the branching morphogenesis of the UB epithelium, remain unclear.</p>
<p>Branching morphogenesis underlies the development of many organs and involves the transition of a simple epithelial tube, or a mass of cells, into a complex, branched structure. There are several cellular mechanisms by which an epithelial tube might bifurcate, including changes in cell shape, oriented cell division, clefting by extracellular matrix filaments, or cell movements, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref022">22</xref>]. In some organs, there is evidence that a particular mechanism contributes to branching—e.g., apical cell constriction in lung budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref023">23</xref>] or clefting by extracellular matrix filaments in salivary gland branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref024">24</xref>]—but for the most part, the cellular basis of branching remains unknown. Some insight into the role of Ret signaling in cell behaviors in the nephric duct, during formation of the primary UB, was obtained by the analysis of chimeric embryos. In these studies, a fraction of nephric duct cells were mutant for <italic>Ret</italic>, for <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic> (two closely related E26 transformation-specific [ETS] transcription factors that act downstream of Ret) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref025">25</xref>], or for <italic>Spry1</italic> (a negative regulator of Ret signaling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref026">26</xref>], and the remainder were wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref028">28</xref>]. The results suggested a competitive process in which Ret signaling stimulates a subset of nephric duct cells, experiencing higher levels of Ret signaling, to move to the site of bud evagination and form the tip of the primary UB.</p>
<p>These findings raised the question whether <italic>Ret</italic>- and <italic>Etv4/Etv5</italic>-dependent cell movements also orchestrate the more complex patterns of branching morphogenesis that occur during kidney development. Several types of cell movement have been observed in the UB and other branching epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref033">33</xref>], but how they are controlled, and their roles in branching morphogenesis, are largely obscure. The analysis of chimeric embryos was not suited to address this question, because cells lacking <italic>Ret</italic>, or <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic>, were excluded from the UB branches at the outset of kidney development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore, we employed Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref034">34</xref>] to induce rare clones, containing mutant and wild-type UB cells, at various stages of renal organogenesis. Starting with <italic>Ret+/−</italic> embryos (whose kidneys are phenotypically close to normal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref035">35</xref>], Cre-mediated interchromosomal recombination between MADM sequence elements on chromosome 6 (MADM6) generates rare cells that contain a <italic>Ret</italic> wild-type allele linked to one fluorescent reporter (e.g., Tomato) and a <italic>Ret</italic> null allele linked to a different reporter (e.g., GFP). When such cells divide, a GFP+, <italic>Ret−/−</italic> daughter and a Tomato+, <italic>Ret+/+</italic> daughter are generated in some cases, while in other cases a double-labeled daughter and an unlabeled daughter (both remaining <italic>Ret</italic>+/−) are produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The behaviors of these labeled cells and their progeny were assessed either by time-lapse microscopy of organ cultures or by examining kidneys that had developed in vivo. Similar clonal analyses using mouse strains with MADM cassettes located on chromosome 11 (MADM11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref037">37</xref>] allowed us also to evaluate the role of <italic>Etv4</italic> in UB tip cell behavior. This novel application of clonal analysis, coupled with time-lapse imaging, provided new insights into the role of the <italic>Ret</italic>/<italic>Etv4</italic> pathway in UB cell behaviors during branching morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Ureteric Bud Tip Cells Are Progenitors of Tip and Trunk Cells</title>
<p>Previous data suggested that the UB tips contain a progenitor cell population that, upon cell division, generates new tip cells (forming the exponentially increasing number of UB tips during kidney development) as well as cells that will populate the UB trunks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref039">39</xref>]. However, the fates of individual UB tip cells and their descendants have not been examined. For this purpose, we followed the behaviors of rare, fluorescently labeled clones that arose during UB branching in renal organ cultures. These labeled clones had the same genotype as the rest of the kidney, except for fluorescent reporter genes (Materials and Methods and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). The kidneys were explanted between E11.5 and E13.0, cultured for 2–3 d, and time-lapse microscopy was used to visualize the appearance, divisions, and movements of the individual labeled cells and their clonally-related descendants.</p>
<p>We analyzed 62 labeled clones, each of which arose from an individual labeled cell in the UB tips (in 34 kidneys), following these clones during the first ~5–6 generations of branching, which readily occur in organ cultures (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s006">S1 Movie</xref></bold>). By the end of the cultures, in 39% of these clones, the daughter cells were distributed among the tips and trunks (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s006">S1 Movie</xref></bold>), in 16% of clones, all cells remained in the tips for the duration of the culture, while 45% of the clones had formed only trunk cells (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s006">S1 Movie</xref></bold>). Thus, most individual tip cells retain the potential to “self-renew” (i.e., to produce some daughters that remain in the progenitor population at the tip), while others have lost this ability and contribute only to the trunks.</p>

<title>Tracking individual clones initiating in a UB tip.</title>
<p>E11.5 or E12.0 kidneys were cultured and time-lapse imaged by fluorescence microscopy. The top image in each column shows the entire UB at the time the labeled clone was first detected (= 0 h). The founder cell(s) (arrow) and its daughters are pseudocolored, as indicated by diagrams at the bottom. <bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>, three clones that arise at a tip and distribute cells between new tips and trunks. <bold>A</bold>, as the tip extends and starts to branch (0–21 h), the clone remains in a cluster near one tip. As the next-generation branches extend (31–40 h), the clone distributes along the tip-trunk axis. By 50–59 h, six cells are in the trunk (outlined in white), and the remainder in the tip. <bold>B</bold>, as the tip branches, one daughter (green) moves past its orange sister to the upper tip (7–14 h), while the others remain in the central cleft. The green subclone remains near the tips during two more branching generations. The cleft narrows to form a trunk (14–24 h), where the purple subclone remains during further branching. The blue subclone is divided between this trunk and a new tip (62 h). Meanwhile, the orange subclone moves far from its siblings, traversing the tip (14–36 h) and ending in the opposite branches. <bold>C</bold>, at 0 h, the clone consists of four cells at a tip (three orange and one green). As the tip extends (8 h), the green cell and one daughter of an orange cell (now colored blue) lag behind the others, and their four daughters end up in the trunk. Meanwhile, the other (orange) cells in this clone remain at the tip, except for one that starts to leave the tip at 18 h. The red clone starts in the middle of the tip and ends entirely in the trunk (28 h). As the trunk elongates and narrows (18–28 h), the red and green/blue cell clusters change from a staggered to a linear arrangement, an apparent example of convergent extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref030">30</xref>]. <bold>D</bold>, an example of a labeled cell that arises in a tip but ends in the trunk, never dividing.

<p>These time-lapse studies also allowed us to measure directly the individual cell cycle times by noting when each successive division occurred in a cell lineage (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Previously, based on kinetics of EdU incorporation, the average cell cycle time in UB tips in vivo was estimated to be 11.7 h at E13.25, slowing to 23.5 h at E17.25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref039">39</xref>]. Those data suggested a unimodal distribution of cell cycle lengths in the UB tips, unlike the cap mesenchyme, which contained a faster-cycling and a slower-cycling subset of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref039">39</xref>]. We also observed a unimodal distribution of cell cycle times in the tips, with a mean of 14.5 h and a range of 8–30 h. This is only slightly slower than the in vivo estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref039">39</xref>], a difference that may be due to the effects of in vitro culture. Cell cycles in the trunks were generally longer, averaging 22.4 h and ranging from 11 h to &gt;40 h. This supports the conclusion from BrdU incorporation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref040">40</xref>] or phosphohistone H3 staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref032">32</xref>] that cells in the tips proliferate more rapidly than those in the trunks.</p>
<p>We confirmed that UB tip cells, collectively, are the progenitor population for most, if not all, collecting duct cells, by using a tip-specific, inducible Cre recombinase allele (<italic>Ret</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup>) to permanently express yellow fluorescent protein (using the <italic>Rosa26R-YFP</italic> reporter allele) in many tip cells and examining the kidneys after development in vivo (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>) or during in vitro culture (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s007">S2 Movie</xref></bold>). Together, these data indicate that a subset of tip cells remain at the tips and maintain the progenitor population, while others lag behind and form the trunks.</p>

<title><italic>Ret</italic> Influences Ureteric Bud Cell Movement and Cell Position in Organ Cultures</title>
<p>What determines which cells will remain at the tips as the ureteric bud grows and branches, and which will be left behind to form the trunk epithelium? We tested the hypothesis that Ret signaling influences this decision, using MADM6 recombination driven by a UB-specific Cre transgene (<italic>Hoxb7/CreGFP</italic>). Starting with a <italic>Ret</italic>+/− kidney, this genetic method (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>) generates rare clones consisting, initially, of a <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cell and a <italic>Ret</italic>−/− sister cell, which are differentially labeled with Tomato (red) or GFP (green; and readily detected despite weak GFP signal throughout the UB from <italic>Hoxb7/CreGFP</italic>). Kidneys were explanted between E12.0 and E13.0, cultured for ~36–48 h, and all of the red and green cells in each clone were followed in time-lapse movies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s008">S3 Movie</xref></bold>). In 50% of the red/green clones (<italic>n</italic> = 60) that arose in the UB tips, most or all of the <italic>Ret+/+</italic> cells moved ahead of the <italic>Ret−/−</italic> cells as the UB extended and branched, and ended up closer to the new tips than the <italic>Ret−/−</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">2G</xref></bold>). In only 15% of the clones did <italic>Ret−/−</italic> cells end up closer to the tips than the <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">Fig 2E and 2G</xref></bold>), while in 35% there was no clear “leader” (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref></bold>). Thus, <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells were &gt;3 times more likely to remain, or move, closer to the UB tips than their <italic>Ret</italic>−/− sisters. Depending on the initial arrangement of <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>MADM6</italic> alleles (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>), the <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells could be either red or green; a similar difference in the behaviors of wild-type versus mutant cells was observed in kidneys where the <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells were red (<italic>Ret</italic>+/+ lead in 19 clones and trail in 4) or green (<italic>Ret</italic>+/+ lead in 11 clones and trail in 5), showing that there was no inherent bias in the behavior of Tomato+ versus GFP+ cells. In many cases (e.g., in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>, the upper-right red cell at 0 h, and its daughters), <italic>Ret+/+</italic> cells moved a considerable distance, from the center or base of a tip into a newly emerging tip, suggesting that the <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells have a competitive advantage in the ability to populate the new tips, not only over their <italic>Ret</italic>−/− sisters but also over the <italic>Ret+/−</italic> cells that comprise most of the UB epithelium.</p>

<p>One type of cell rearrangement in the ureteric bud tips occurs at mitosis (termed “mitosis-associated cell dispersal”, MACD), when one daughter immediately moves, via the lumen, to a site approximately 1–3 cells distant, while the other daughter remains at the site of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref032">32</xref>]. Both <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ and <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells underwent MACD following most mitoses (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). However, this was not the only mechanism by which <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells moved relative to <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells, as many changes in the relative positions of wild-type versus mutant cells also occurred in between cell divisions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We examined the effects of <italic>Ret</italic> on UB cell proliferation by measuring the final number of red and green cells per clone (each clone begins as one red and one green cell), and also by noting the time intervals between successive mitoses (as shown for wild-type cells in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Both <italic>Ret+/+</italic> and <italic>Ret−/−</italic> UB cells had a mode of cell cycle lengths at 14–15 h, but in <italic>Ret</italic>–/–cells, the distribution was shifted towards longer cell cycles (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">Fig 2H</xref></bold>), and the average was slightly longer than in <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells (16.7 ± 3.9 h versus 14.4 ± 3.4 h; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02, <italic>t</italic> test). Similarly, the average MADM clone ended with 3.8 ± 3.3 <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells versus 3.1 ± 2.1 <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>t</italic> test). However, the effect of <italic>Ret</italic> on cell proliferation appeared likely to be a secondary consequence of its effect on cell position: among the 30 clones where <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells ended closer to the tips, the average ratio of <italic>Ret+/+</italic> to <italic>Ret−/−</italic> cells was 1.36, whereas among the nine clones where <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells ended closer to the tips, the ratio was 0.74, and among the 21 clones where there was no clear difference in position, the average ratio was 1.14. Thus, in MADM clones, <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells apparently proliferate more than their <italic>Ret</italic>−/− sister cells because they usually remain closer to the UB tips, and probably not because of an inherent effect of <italic>Ret</italic> on cell proliferation.</p>
<p>The death of a GFP+ or Tomato+ cell, when it occurred, was visible in the time-lapse movies: the cell fragmented, then disappeared (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s004">S4D Fig</xref></bold>). However, cell death was rare—5 <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ and 1 <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cell deaths were observed among ~250 <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ and ~200 <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells—and thus did not contribute significantly to the numbers of <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ versus <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells. Even this low level of cell death is likely a culture artifact, as UB cell death is virtually undetectable in kidneys developing in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref043">43</xref>].</p>

<p>Among the E17.5 <italic>Ret</italic>-MADM6 clones, there was a more pronounced difference in the number of <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ versus <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells than seen in the cultured E12.0–13.0 kidneys. The average clone contained 8.7± 29 <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells and 2.1±1.4 <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells. However, these averages were skewed by a few very large clones with up to several hundred <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells, and many fewer <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells (as MADM recombination driven by <italic>Hoxb7/CreGFP</italic> can occur at any stage of kidney development, these large clones at E17.5 presumably resulted from early recombination events): the median number of cells per clone (a statistic that is insensitive to a few very large clones) was 3 <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ and <italic>2 Ret</italic>−/− cells. The numbers of clones containing different ratios of <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ to <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells is shown in a histogram in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>.

<p>The average cell cycle lengths for <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ versus <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− UB tip cells were indistinguishable (15.1 ± 3.0 versus 15.4 ± 3.5 h, respectively). Another measure of cell proliferation, the final number of cells per clone, showed a small but significant difference: 3.4 ± 3.3 <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ cells versus 3.1 ± 2.4 <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− cells per clone (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04, <italic>t</italic> test). Thus, loss of <italic>Etv4</italic> has only a minor effect on cell proliferation; the somewhat greater effect of <italic>Ret</italic> than <italic>Etv4</italic> on proliferation probably reflects its similarly stronger influence on cell position (compare <bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g002">2G</xref></bold> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g004">4</xref><bold>H</bold>).</p>
<p>The positions of the <italic>Etv4</italic> mutant versus wild-type cells in 113 additional <italic>Etv4</italic>-MADM11 clones were analyzed retrospectively in vibratome sections of E16.5 kidneys (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g005">Fig 5A–5H</xref>)</bold>. In 37% of clones, the green <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ cells were closer to the UB tips than the red <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− cells, while the <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− cells were closer in only 10% (in 53%, neither the <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ nor <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− cells were unambiguously closer) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g005">Fig 5I</xref></bold>). As in the <italic>Etv4</italic>-MADM11 time-lapse studies, an “advantage” of <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ over <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− cells was observed in both <italic>Etv5</italic><sup><italic>M/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Etv5</italic><sup><italic>M/M</italic></sup> genetic backgrounds (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g005">Fig 5J</xref></bold>).

<title>Wild Type Ureteric Bud Tip Cells Exhibit Heterogeneous Levels of Ret Signaling, and Undergo Extensive Spatial Rearrangements</title>
<p>In the MADM clonal analyses, the <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> genotype of a UB tip cell strongly influenced its ability to stay close to the new tips during UB branching. How do these observations pertain to the development of a normal kidney, in which all cells are wild-type for <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic>? In contrast to the expression of <italic>Ret</italic> mRNA, which appears similar among all UB tips cells [e.g., Fig 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref048">48</xref>], we found that the levels of Etv4 and Etv5 proteins, whose expression is up-regulated by Ret signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref025">25</xref>], are extremely heterogeneous among wild-type UB tip cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6A–6E</xref></bold>). Vsnl1, another protein whose expression in the UB tip requires Ret signaling, was also shown to have a mosaic pattern of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref049">49</xref>]. Thus, even wild-type UB tip cells exhibit strong variation in levels of Ret signaling markers. As some transcription factors are expressed in pulsatile patterns [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref050">50</xref>], which cannot be discerned by antibody staining, it remains to be determined whether the variable levels of Etv4 and Etv5 proteins represent stable changes or pulsatile fluctuations.</p>

<p>To ask if the future contribution of a UB tip cell to the new tips versus the trunks could be predicted from its location within the branching UB tip, we measured the starting locations of labeled (wild-type) clones, which had been tracked in time-lapse movies (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The location of the founder cell for each clone along the proximal–distal and medial–lateral axes was plotted on an idealized UB tip (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6F</xref></bold>). Only cells with daughters that stayed at the tips (red symbols) were found in the most distal region, but throughout most of the UB tip, they were located similarly to cells that generated only future trunk cells (blue symbols). This suggests that clones starting out in similar locations can end up in different regions of the branching UB.</p>
<p>This analysis predicted that neighboring cells within an individual UB tip may sometimes move in different directions, a prediction that was confirmed by the time-lapse analysis of labeled wild-type clones (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6G–6J</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s010">S5 Movie</xref></bold>). For example, in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6G</xref></bold>, three cells (pseudocolored orange, 6 h) move from the base of a tip towards one of the newly forming tips; meanwhile, a sibling cell (purple) and a nearby independent clone (green) move far away to populate the trunk of the opposite branch. In <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6H</xref></bold>, the cells colored orange and green (two sisters from a recent division) orbit around each other by &gt;180°, and the initially-trailing orange subclone ends up closer to the tip. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006"><bold>Fig 6I</bold> and <bold>6J</bold></xref>, one of two sister cells (arrow) moves forward towards the tip, while the other sister remains at the base of the tip. Thus, even in kidneys where all cells have the same genotype, some UB tip cells undergo long-range movements comparable to those seen in kidneys that are genetically mosaic for <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic>. Together, these data suggest a model in which natural cell-to-cell variation in the level of Ret signaling influences the behavior and fate of UB tip cells during normal branching morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Morphogenesis of the renal collecting system involves repeated cycles of ureteric bud branching, during which the tips elongate and then bifurcate (or sometimes trifurcate) to form new branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref052">52</xref>]. New cells are added primarily by cell division in the tips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref040">40</xref>], although cells in the trunks (and, later, in the elongating collecting ducts) also continue to divide at a lower rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref053">53</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Here, we first showed, by time-lapse analysis of individual clones in cultured wild-type kidneys, that many individual UB tip cells give rise to daughters that remain at the growing tips, during one or more branch generations, and to other daughters that are left behind to form the elongating trunks. This, together with other types of cell lineage tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref038">38</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002382.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>), establishes that the tips constitute the main progenitor population for UB growth, as has been observed in several other branching epithelial structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref055">55</xref>]. We then investigated the genetic mechanisms that determine which cells in a UB tip will remain at the tips during subsequent elongation and branching. Based on previous studies of cell behaviors during primary ureteric budding from the nephric duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref028">28</xref>], we hypothesized that Ret signaling, acting in part via the transcription factors <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic>, plays an important role in this process. We therefore used MADM to generate fluorescently labeled clones, each initiating as a wild-type cell and a sister cell lacking <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic>, in an otherwise heterozygous organ; we tracked these clones during branching morphogenesis in organ cultures, or analyzed their spatial distributions in fixed kidneys. Such tip cell clones became progressively dispersed as the kidneys grew, and we observed a strong propensity for <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ or <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ cells to remain closer to the UB tips than their <italic>Ret</italic>−/− or <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− sister cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>). This reveals that Ret signaling, at least in part via its effect on <italic>Etv4</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref025">25</xref>], can strongly influence a cell’s ability to remain at the tips of the expanding ureteric tree.</p>

<p><bold>A,</bold> In <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> MADM clones, the wild-type cells (red) tend to remain closer to the new ureteric bud tips than their <italic>Ret</italic>−/− or <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− sister cells (green) as the ureteric bud branches. <bold>B</bold>, In wild-type kidneys, Ret signaling is lost in a fraction of tip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6A–6E</xref>); we suggest that the cells retaining high levels of Ret signaling move towards the sites where new tips are forming (red arrows), thus contributing to branching, while the cells with reduced Ret signaling lag behind and form the new trunks. During normal development, this appears to be primarily a one-way process. The de novo formation of tips from trunks has been observed in cultured kidneys, during rare lateral branching events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref051">51</xref>], and can be induced by the juxtaposition of isolated UB trunks with isolated metanephric mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref056">56</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms of such de novo tip formation, and whether it occurs during kidney development in vivo, remain unclear.</p>

</fig>
<p>The effect of loss of <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> on tip cells was not absolute, as in a small proportion of MADM clones, the mutant UB cells remained closer to the tips than the wild-type cells, and in other clones, there was no clear difference in their positions; however, the tendency of wild-type cells to take the “lead” was highly significant, in both time-lapse analyses of cultured, early-stage kidneys and (to an even greater extent) in retrospective analyses of E16.5 or E17.5 fetal kidneys. Thus, while the <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> genotype is not the sole determinant of tip cell fate in such genetically mosaic kidneys, it is an important one. One explanation for the instances in which wild-type cells failed to show an advantage is that Ret signaling is normally heterogeneous among UB tip cells, even in fully wild-type kidneys (as revealed by varying levels of diphospho-Erk, or <italic>Etv4</italic> or <italic>Etv5</italic> expression, from cell to cell). Thus, even some of the <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ or <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ tip cells in MADM clones presumably lose Ret signaling activity and are thus fated to leave the tip and form trunk. Another potential reason is that several other growth factors and receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref018">18</xref>], including FGF10 and FGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref057">57</xref>], promote UB branching in cooperation with GDNF and Ret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref048">48</xref>] and may influence UB cell behavior in similar ways; perhaps some <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells are “rescued,” at least temporarily, by FGF signaling.</p>
<p>Loss of <italic>Etv4</italic> alone has only minor effects on kidney development, while the defects are greatly exacerbated by <italic>Etv5</italic> mutations, indicating that these two transcription factors act somewhat redundantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref025">25</xref>]. For this reason, we performed <italic>Etv4</italic>-MADM in different <italic>Etv5</italic> genetic backgrounds; yet loss of <italic>Etv4</italic> strongly influenced UB cell behavior even in an <italic>Etv5</italic>+/+ background. Thus, cells lacking <italic>Etv4</italic> are at a competitive disadvantage in the ability to stay at the UB tip, even if they retain <italic>Etv5</italic> (this experiment did not test if <italic>Etv5</italic> also affects cell position, since all the cells in each kidney had the same <italic>Etv5</italic> genotype). We also found that <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ cells not only remained closer to the tips than <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells, but in many cases they moved towards, and concentrated at, the extreme UB tips, revealing an advantage over the <italic>Ret</italic>+/− cells that constitute most of the UB epithelium in <italic>Ret</italic>-MADM6 kidneys. Thus, relatively minor differences in the level of Ret signaling may confer an advantage in a competition among UB cells to move toward the sites where new tips are forming.</p>
<p>The role of GDNF/Ret signaling in UB tip cell proliferation had been unclear, as one previous study indicated that exogenous GDNF promoted the proliferation of UB tip cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref058">58</xref>], while another showed no such effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref015">15</xref>]. Here, we could directly assess the cell-autonomous effect of loss of Ret signaling on UB tip cell proliferation, by observing the cell cycle lengths of the <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ versus <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells in MADM clones, in time-lapse movies. Our results showed that <italic>Ret−</italic>/− tip cells divided only slightly less often than their <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ sister cells. Because the <italic>Ret</italic>−/− cells typically lagged behind their <italic>Ret</italic>+/+ sisters, and since cell proliferation in wild-type kidneys becomes slower as UB cells leave the tips and enter the trunks, it is likely that the modest effect of <italic>Ret</italic> genotype on tip cell proliferation is a secondary consequence of its effect on cell movement (and thus cell position). In <italic>Etv4</italic>-MADM clones, we also observed only a small difference between the proliferation of <italic>Etv4</italic>+/+ and <italic>Etv4</italic>−/− UB cells. Thus, the strongest effect of the <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> genotypes was an influence on the ability of tip cells to remain near the tips during kidney growth. Apparently, in wild type kidneys, the higher rate of proliferation of tip versus trunk cells is mainly due to the mitogenic effects of other factors expressed by the cap mesenchyme cells that surround the tips, such as FGFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref041">41</xref>], and not primarily to GDNF.</p>
<p>Why do <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> wild-type cells tend to remain closer to the branching UB tips than their mutant sister cells? We propose that many (but not all) cells in the UB tips move in the direction of growth of the newly forming tips, and that Ret signaling, via Etv4 and Etv5, promotes these cell movements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>). Presumably, Etv4 and Etv5 induce the expression of effector genes that participate in cell movement; candidates include the chemokine receptor <italic>Cxcr4</italic> and the matrix metalloprotease <italic>Mmp14</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref025">25</xref>]. How these cell movements are guided remains unclear; they could be directed by diffusible signals from the cap mesenchyme, or from other tip cells, or perhaps by other positional cues such as gradients of cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref059">59</xref>]. An obvious candidate for a chemoattractive signal is GNDF, as <italic>Ret</italic>-expressing cultured cells can migrate towards a source of GDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref060">60</xref>], and GDNF appears to act as a chemoattractant for enteric neural crest cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref062">62</xref>]. The cap mesenchyme cells expressing GDNF are broadly distributed around the entire UB tip, and it is thus unlikely that the expression pattern of GDNF generates gradients that could direct cell movements towards the specific sites of new tip formation; however, it remains possible that GDNF gradients are shaped by secondary mechanisms, such as binding to extracellular matrix components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref066">66</xref>], or other mechanisms of ligand sequestration or redistribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref069">69</xref>]. Alternatively, Ret signaling via Etv4/Etv5 could up-regulate the expression of another receptor(s) for a different signal(s) that provides the positional information for tip cell movements; or it might promote general cell motility per se (although this was not apparent from examination of mutant versus wild-type UB cells in the time lapse movies).</p>
<p>While our observations on the role of <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> in cell behaviors were made in genetically mosaic kidneys, we observed extensive cell movements in the normal UB epithelium, similar to those seen in the genetically mosaic kidneys. Furthermore, in wild type UB tips, the level of Ret signaling activity appeared to be extremely heterogeneous from cell to cell. This suggests a model in which Ret signaling is somehow repressed in a subset of UB tip cells but maintained in others, generating UB tips that are “mosaic” in Ret signaling, although genetically wild-type (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>). The mechanism by which such heterogeneity is generated remains unclear. According to this model, the tip cells with reduced Ret signaling are fated to become trunk cells and fail to move toward the newly forming tips, while those cells retaining high levels of Ret signaling preferentially move tipward. Since GDNF/Ret signaling maintains <italic>Ret</italic> gene expression through a positive feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref058">58</xref>], the <italic>Ret</italic>-expressing tip cells with reduced signaling activity will eventually lose <italic>Ret</italic> expression as well. Our results support the hypothesis that <italic>Ret</italic>-dependent cell movements are part of the basic mechanism by which the UB tip epithelium changes its shape, thus forming new branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref070">70</xref>]. Thus, the abnormalities in UB branching caused by mutations affecting the Ret pathway, in mice and humans, are likely to be caused by defects in epithelial cell movements.</p>
<p>How do UB cells move with respect to their sisters and other neighboring cells? Several mechanisms of UB cell movement have been described, including MACD, short-range cell intercalation, and rosette rearrangement. MACD causes the rearrangement of most dividing cells within the UB tips, due to the jumping of one daughter to a noncontiguous location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref032">32</xref>]. But these are relatively short-range movements (typically 1–3 cell diameters), they are apparently unaffected by lack of <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic>, and they occur at mitosis, while we observed extensive tip cell movements in between cell divisions. Rosette resolution and cell intercalation have been documented in elongating mouse-collecting ducts and frog pronephric duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref031">31</xref>], but these are also relatively short-range forms of cell movement; in contrast, we observed long-range movements of labeled cells in the UB tips, both wild type and genetically mosaic, which are unlikely to be explained by these mechanisms. It thus appears that UB epithelial cells are capable of extensive migration within the epithelium during branching morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Mutant clonal analysis is an important approach to study gene function during development and has been used widely in lower organisms such as the fly, but infrequently in mammalian systems. MADM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref071">71</xref>], like MARCM in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref072">72</xref>], is a particularly powerful method, as it generates pairs of mutant/wild type sister cells that are differentially labeled, and whose behaviors can be directly visualized and compared. While MADM has been used to study the distribution of mutant/wild type clones in neural development and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref073">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref075">75</xref>], it has not been previously combined with time-lapse analysis to study cell behaviors during organogenesis. While the genes that can be studied using this approach are currently limited to those on chromosomes for which MADM alleles have been generated, currently chromosomes 6, 7, 11, and 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref076">76</xref>], the generation of additional MADM strains will extend the number of chromosomes amenable to this powerful method of clonal analysis.</p>

<p>To plot the starting locations of labeled wild-type clones (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6F</xref></bold>), we selected clones in UB tips that were at a stage of branching at which (width at the tip)/(width at the “neck”) was ≥ 2, but in which the two nascent tips had not yet begun to branch again; for example, in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold> this would include the tip in the middle but not the tip on the left (too narrow) nor the one on the right (nascent tips already branching again). As the shapes of the initial T-shaped UB tips at E11.5 were very heterogeneous, only clones arising in later branching generations were used; the latter were also excluded if the tip shape was too irregular to accurately measure the cell position. The position of each founder cell was measured along the proximal–distal and medial–lateral axes of the tip, and a symbol was drawn at the corresponding position on the idealized UB tip shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002382.g006">Fig 6F</xref></bold>.

<title>Generation of labeled cells using MADM.</title>
<p>The key in the upper right explains the symbols used. In the starting cell (top diagram), shown in G1 phase, one chromosome 6 homolog carries the <italic>MADM-GT</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref036">36</xref>] at the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus in <italic>cis</italic> to a <italic>Ret</italic>-null allele (−), and the other chromosome 6 homolog carries the <italic>MADM-TG</italic> allele at the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus in <italic>cis</italic> to a wild-type <italic>Ret</italic> allele (+). Thus, the cell is heterozygous for <italic>Ret</italic>. Neither the <italic>MADM-GT</italic> nor <italic>MADM-TG</italic> allele expresses a functional fluorescent protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref036">36</xref>]. If Cre-mediated recombination occurs during G1 phase (or during G0, or in postmitotic cells), it generates a functional Tomato (red fluorescent protein) gene and a functional GFP gene in the same diploid cell, so the cell is double-labeled and appears yellow. It also remains heterozygous for <italic>Ret</italic>. If Cre-mediated recombination occurs during G2, after DNA replication, the recombination products include a functional Tomato gene in <italic>cis</italic> to a <italic>Ret</italic> wild-type allele, and a functional GFP gene in cis to a <italic>Ret</italic>-null allele (shown on chromatids 2 and 3, respectively), as well as two non-recombined, non-functional MADM alleles (on chromatids 1 and 4). At mitosis, the four chromatids segregate in either of two patterns, X-segregation or Z-segregation. The former yields a <italic>Ret</italic>−/−, GFP-expressing cell and a <italic>Ret</italic> +/+, Tomato-expressing cell. The latter yields an unlabeled cell and a double-labeled (yellow) cell, both of which remain <italic>Ret</italic>+/−. Subsequent cell divisions preserve the genotype and fluorescent protein expression of the initial recombinant cells. The strategy for <italic>Etv4</italic>-MADM was similar, except we used MADM alleles on chromosome 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002382.ref037">37</xref>], where <italic>Etv4</italic> is located.
