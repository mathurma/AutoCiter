<article-title>Neuropeptides Modulate Female Chemosensory Processing upon Mating in Drosophila</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>The ability to find and consume nutrient-rich diets for successful reproduction and survival is fundamental to animal life. Among the nutrients important for all animals are polyamines, a class of pungent smelling compounds required in numerous cellular and organismic processes. Polyamine deficiency or excess has detrimental effects on health, cognitive function, reproduction, and lifespan. Here, we show that a diet high in polyamine is beneficial and increases reproductive success of flies, and we unravel the sensory mechanisms that attract <italic>Drosophila</italic> to polyamine-rich food and egg-laying substrates. Using a combination of behavioral genetics and in vivo calcium imaging, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> uses multisensory detection to find and evaluate polyamines present in overripe and fermenting fruit, their favored feeding and egg-laying substrate. In the olfactory system, two coexpressed ionotropic receptors (IRs), IR76b and IR41a, mediate the long-range attraction to the odor. In the gustatory system, multimodal taste sensation by IR76b receptor and GR66a bitter receptor neurons is used to evaluate quality and valence of the polyamine providing a mechanism for the fly’s high attraction to polyamine-rich and sweet decaying fruit. Given their universal and highly conserved biological roles, we propose that the ability to evaluate food for polyamine content may impact health and reproductive success also of other animals including humans.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Animals, including humans, evaluate food by its smell and taste. Odors and tastes not only signal the presence of food, they also reveal details about the type and amount of nutrients contained in it. A preference for certain foods frequently reflects the specific metabolic needs of an animal. Among the important but less known compounds that animals consume with their diet are polyamines. These pungent smelling molecules are essential for reproduction, development, and cognition. Interestingly, they are also produced by the cell and body, but their levels decline with age. A diet high in polyamines can improve age-related memory deficits and loss of fertility. We have used the model fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to unravel if and how animals detect polyamines in their food and environment, and which role this detection plays in their food choice behavior. Polyamine levels are particularly high in the fly’s favorite food and egg-laying substrate, overripe and decaying fruit. We found that food supplemented with polyamines indeed improves the reproductive success of a fly couple. We show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> is highly attracted to polyamines and uses them to identify promising egg-laying and feeding sites. It detects them through an ancient clade of receptor proteins on its olfactory and taste organs. We speculate that other animals can also detect polyamines and use their smell and taste to identify sources of these beneficial nutrients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animals make use of all of their senses while searching and evaluating food. For most, smell and taste are the major modalities to assess the quality and nutritional value of food. While odors help the animal to track down food over long distances, short-range evaluation using the sense of taste is ultimately crucial for the decision whether to feed or to lay an egg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref002">2</xref>]. In general, animals prefer calorie-dense and sweet foods to bitter foods (see for instance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref003">3</xref>]). In addition, animals need to consume food containing other important nutrients. Among the vital dietary constituents are polyamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref004">4</xref>]. Polyamines, most notably putrescine, spermine, and spermidine, are essential for basic cellular processes such as cell growth and proliferation, and are of specific importance during reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref006">6</xref>]. While polyamines can be generated by endogenous biosynthesis or microbes in the gut, a significant fraction comes from the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref004">4</xref>]. Animal products, soybeans, or certain fruits are rich sources of polyamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref004">4</xref>]. In cells, these polycations are bound to nucleic acids, proteins, and phospholipids, where they participate in fundamental cellular processes such as DNA replication, RNA translation, and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref007">7</xref>]. Polyamine deficiency can have fatal consequences on reproductive success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref005">5</xref>]; and low polyamine levels have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref008">8</xref>]. Yet, high polyamine concentrations are found in cancer cells suggesting that their excess could be unhealthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref006">6</xref>]. Notably, the enzymes that generate endogenous polyamines decline with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref007">7</xref>]. And the exogenous supply through high polyamine diets can have beneficial effects on ageing, memory loss, and reproduction in a variety of model species and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref011">11</xref>]. Given their beneficial but also detrimental roles, food industry has consequently measured the amount of polyamines in many food items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref012">12</xref>]. Whether animals can directly evaluate polyamine content for instance through their taste organ is not known. The smell of polyamines, however, can be detected by animals, including humans; it is strongly pungent and at higher concentrations unpleasant to humans. There is circumstantial evidence indicating that insects may detect the smell and taste of polyamines. For instance, <italic>Calliphora</italic> blowflies are attracted to decaying flesh and lay their eggs exclusively into corpses. This attraction could be due to the carrion smell of cadaverine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref013">13</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies are notorious for their attraction to overripe and fermenting fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref015">15</xref>]. The amount of polyamines increases dramatically in fruit within days after harvest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref016">16</xref>] and during fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, for these flies, polyamines are candidate molecules for the detection of beneficial feeding and egg-laying sites. This may also hold true for females of other insects. For instance, females of the dengue fever vector, the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> typically lay their eggs in batches in standing waters such as flowerpot plates with decaying organic and polyamine-rich materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref019">19</xref>]. Although an olfactory receptor, trace amine-associated receptor 13c (TAAR13c), for one polyamine, cadaverine, was recently described in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref020">20</xref>], no taste receptor has been identified so far. Chemosensory receptors for the detection of polyamines remain uncharacterized in insects.</p>
<p>To detect chemosensory stimuli animals use highly specialized families of receptor proteins that are present in sensory neurons on peripheral taste or smell organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref021">21</xref>]. Given their importance in animal life, a large effort goes into identification of these receptors and their putative odors or tastes. <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> has proven to be a useful model in matching olfactory and gustatory receptors (GRs) to their ligands and has contributed much to our understanding of chemosensory coding in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Insects possess three classes of olfactory receptors (ORs): the classical ORs, the more recently described but evolutionarily older family of ionotropic receptors (IRs), and a few GRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref026">26</xref>]. Each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) is located in a sensillum on either antenna or maxillary palp and expresses a specific type or very small combination of receptors, which are tuned to a narrow group of molecules. All OSNs that express the same receptor project their axons to one of ~50 glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) in the central brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref027">27</xref>]. This highly conserved architecture allows the translation of a nonspatial sensory cue into a highly organized spatial map and provides the logic for odor coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref021">21</xref>]. Upon additional local processing at the level of the AL, the odor information is sent via projection neurons (PNs) to two main higher brain centers, the mushroom body and the lateral horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref028">28</xref>]. While many of the ~45 ORs have been deorphanized, ligands for a number of IRs remain uncharacterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref029">29</xref>]. Previous work showed that most of the IR OSNs express one of the putative coreceptors IR8a or IR25a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref031">31</xref>]. Among the deorphanized IRs is IR92a, the receptor for ammonia and small amines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref032">32</xref>]. The behavioral role of most IRs, however, remains elusive with few exceptions such as IR84a and IR64a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), in contrast to OSNs, are found on many peripheral as well as internal organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref035">35</xref>]. On the external sensory organs, GRN-containing sensilla are mainly found on the labellum, the legs, and the wing margins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref035">35</xref>]. The labellum carries ~60 morphologically distinct sensilla with four GRNs each that are tuned to distinct flavors such as sweet, salty, water (appetitive) or bitter, and acidic (noxious). While GRs form the best-characterized family of taste receptors to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref036">36</xref>], more recent members of the IRs have been implicated in the sensation of tastants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref039">39</xref>]. For instance, IR76b was shown to be essential for the detection of appetitive concentrations of salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]. Interestingly, IR76b is also expressed in GRNs that do not detect salt, but a role for these neurons has not been assigned yet. Finally, increasing evidence suggests that dietary amines can be tasted, but receptors have not been identified yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref037">37</xref>]. Peripheral GRNs project to the central brain or in the case of GRNs on tarsae or wings, also to the ventral nerve cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref035">35</xref>]. In the central brain, the distinct patterns of innervation in an area called the subesophageal zone (SEZ) by bitter and sweet neurons indicated a taste map similar to but less structured than the map found in the AL of the olfactory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref041">41</xref>]. In contrast to the olfactory system, however, higher order processing of tastes is still not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>We have analyzed at the sensory, molecular, and behavioral levels how polyamines guide insect preference behavior. First, we demonstrate that a polyamine-rich diet significantly increases the number of progeny of flies. Second, we show that flies can find and evaluate polyamine-rich feeding and egg-laying sites using their senses of smell and taste. We characterize the polyamine receptors and demonstrate an essential role for specific IRs in olfactory and gustatory organs. Altogether, our data characterize sensory receptors for polyamines and their behavioral role in insects and indicate that the ability to sense polyamines promotes reproductive success and survival.</p>

<title>Polyamine-Rich Diet Increases Reproductive Success of <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>Given the evidence that polyamines are vital molecules during reproduction, we asked whether males and females feeding on polyamine-rich food would produce more offspring compared to flies on standard fly food (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and Methods</xref>). Therefore, we crossed single males to single females in two different conditions—on standard fly food and fly food that had been supplemented with putrescine or cadaverine solution (~2.5 mmol polyamine/l of food). After 4 d, the parental generation was discarded, and the number of eggs laid was quantified. In addition, once these eggs had developed into flies, these were counted again. Females on polyamine-enriched food laid ~3 times the amount of eggs compared to females on standard food. Similarly, fly pairs fed a high-polyamine diet had ~3 times more offspring than the couples on standard fly food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Thus, it indeed appeared that polyamine-enriched food was beneficial for reproduction of flies similarly as what has been suggested for other species such as humans.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Is Strongly Attracted to Volatile Polyamines</title>
<p><italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> flies are notorious for being attracted to, and for laying their eggs into, decaying fruits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref014">14</xref>]. We asked whether this preference was rooted in the need to consume polyamines, present in fermenting fruit. First, we quantified the attraction of male and female flies to fruits at different stages of maturity with a laboratory choice assay, the T-maze. We found that flies show a strong aversion to green bananas, are indifferent to yellow bananas, but are highly attracted to the same batch of overripe bananas 5–7 d later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref043">43</xref>]. Next, we tested whether <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s attraction to decaying fruit could, in part, be attributed to increased concentrations of polyamines produced during ripening and decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref016">16</xref>]. Running the same T-maze assays with different polyamines, we found that female and male flies were strongly attracted to the odor of spermine (sperm.), spermidine (sperd.), diaminopropane (prop.), putrescine (put.), cadaverine (cad.), diaminohexane (hex.), diaminoheptane (hept.), diaminooctane (oct.), and diaminodecane (dec.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The responses were dose-dependent with 1 mM (~10 ppm) eliciting the strongest attraction compared to lower as well as higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s002">S1A Fig</xref>; 1 μM–1 M). This concentration roughly corresponded to the amount of putrescine found in fermented banana (~0.9 mmol/kg) or fresh oranges (~1.3 mmol/kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref012">12</xref>]. We observed the same attraction when single female flies were assayed in the T-maze, suggesting that individual flies perceive and are attracted to the odor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s002">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To uncover the neural basis of the fly’s attraction to this class of important nutrients, we sought to identify the receptor for polyamine sensation. Preference to a chemical in the T-maze is typically mediated by the olfactory system. Indeed, flies with surgically removed antennae, the main olfactory organ, lost their T-maze preference for polyamines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Previous reports indicated that OR- and IR-expressing OSNs respond to putrescine in single sensillum recordings (SSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>]. From these two receptor classes, the entire OR system can be impaired at once by mutating the obligatory OR coreceptor (Orco) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref047">47</xref>]. <italic>Orco</italic> mutant flies maintained normal attraction to putrescine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s002">S1D Fig</xref>), excluding this family of receptors from our search as suggested before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>]. We then analyzed the requirement of IRs. To suppress all IR-mediated chemosensation, we relied on <italic>atonal</italic> (<italic>ato</italic>) mutants, as they fail to develop IR-expressing coeloconic sensilla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref049">49</xref>]. <italic>ato</italic> mutant flies did not show any preference for putrescine or cadaverine in the T-maze (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s002">S1E Fig</xref>). We concluded that IRs mediate attraction to volatile polyamines. To identify specific IRs, we carried out a small genetic screen using loss of function of single IRs. From all IR mutants tested, including the two putative coreceptors <italic>IR8a</italic> and <italic>IR25a</italic>, only <italic>IR76b</italic> mutants showed a significant reduction in polyamine attraction in the T-maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s002">S1F Fig</xref>). To confirm a requirement for IR76b, we silenced the activity of IR76b neurons by expressing the inward-rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref050">50</xref>]. Flies of the genotype <italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> showed a strong impairment in attraction to putrescine or cadaverine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that IRs may form functional heteromers in olfactory neurons, similarly to ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore, IR76b as judged by reporter expression using a previously characterized <italic>IR76b-Gal4</italic> transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>] was expressed in multiple types of OSNs with axons innervating four glomeruli strongly and three weakly in the AL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1F</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>]). This strengthened the notion that another receptor might be used in conjunction with IR76b as previously hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>]. Among the OSNs previously shown to respond to putrescine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>] is a subset of IR41a-expressing neurons, housed in ac2 sensilla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>]. We blocked the activity of IR41a neurons with Kir2.1 <italic>(IR41a-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1)</italic> and found that similar to IR76b neuron silencing, these flies showed no attraction to polyamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Using double labeling with <italic>IR41a-Gal4</italic> and <italic>IR76b-QF</italic>, which labels the same neurons as <italic>IR76b-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s003">S2 Fig</xref> and see also Silbering et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>]), we found that a small subset of OSNs innervating a ventral and central (VC5) glomerulus coexpresses IR41a and IR76b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To obtain more direct evidence of a requirement of IR76b in IR41a neurons, we re-expressed IR76b in the <italic>IR76b</italic> mutant background selectively in IR41a or in all IR76b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). As expected, re-expression of IR76b in IR76b neurons fully rescued the flies’ attraction to polyamine odor (<italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-IR76b;IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Importantly, the same rescue was observed when we re-expressed IR76b selectively in IR41a neurons (<italic>IR41a-Gal4;UAS-IR76b;IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). In a reciprocal experiment to test the role of IR41a in these neurons, we used RNAi to knockdown IR41a in IR76b-expressing neurons (<italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-IR41a-i</italic>) and assayed the effect in the T-maze. Knockdown of IR41a using two different RNAi transgenes reduced attraction to polyamines significantly as compared to control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>These data, taken together, provide strong evidence that IR41a/IR76b coexpressing neurons are necessary and sufficient to mediate polyamine attraction.</p>

<title>IR76b Is Required for the Polyamine Odor Response of IR41a OSNs</title>
<p>To strengthen the evidence for a role of IR41a/IR76b OSNs in the detection of polyamine odor, we used in vivo calcium imaging as a proxy of neuronal activity of these OSNs. To this end, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref051">51</xref>] under the control of <italic>IR76b-Gal4</italic> or <italic>IR41a-Gal4</italic> (<italic>IR-Gal4;UAS-GCaMP6f</italic>) and recorded increases in intracellular calcium levels in response to the polyamine odor stimulus at the level of the axon terminals in the AL in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). When GCaMP was expressed exclusively in IR41a neurons, the innervated glomerulus strongly responded to putrescine in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref046">46</xref>]). Similarly, only a single glomerulus, the one innervated by IR41a/IR76b neurons, responded strongly to polyamine odor when GCaMP was expressed in all IR76b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g002">Fig 2E–2H</xref>). An independent IR76b, but not IR41a, neuron-innervated glomerulus, by contrast, did not respond significantly to polyamines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s004">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>). Notably, the response was very long lasting (&gt; 15 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g002">Fig 2D and 2H</xref>). Photoionization detector (PID) measurements suggested that odor might have been released into the airstream for up to 4 s with a 500 ms stimulus, because polyamine leaves a trace in the delivery line, which is cleaned out by air. This could, in part, explain this long-lasting response. Alternatively, this prolonged response could be a feature of some IR neurons as has been observed for other odors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<title>Taste Neurons Mediate Short-Range Egg-Laying Choices on Polyamines</title>
<p>Our data indicated that flies are attracted to a source of volatile polyamine such as overripe fruit through specific olfactory neurons. Furthermore, we showed that females on polyamine-enriched food laid more eggs and had more offspring than females on standard food (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We therefore asked if females use polyamines as a hallmark of beneficial egg-laying sites. To analyze this, we quantified the number of eggs laid on a polyamine-rich but otherwise plain, sugar-free substrate (polyamine and 1% agarose) versus a control substrate (1% agarose) in an oviposition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, and in contrast to their olfactory preference, female flies avoided the polyamine-rich substrate and laid the majority of eggs on the polyamine-free site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4A–S4C Fig</xref>). Single females made the same choice as groups of females and laid their eggs away from polyamines showing that this aversion was not a consequence of overcrowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). While it was previously suggested that female flies avoid laying their eggs directly into feeding substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref052">52</xref>], the apparent dislike of the beneficial polyamine-rich substrates as oviposition sites was surprising. This behavior could reflect the rather artificial assay conditions, where flies chose between polyamine-rich and polyamine-free but an otherwise taste- or odorless substrate. Because in a decaying fruit, polyamines appear together with other food odors and tastes, we reasoned that females might find them more appealing for oviposition when combined to other chemosensory cues. We tested this by mixing either of two polyamines, putrescine or cadaverine, with apple juice and gave the flies the choice to lay their eggs either on apple juice alone or on the mixture. While flies prefer to lay their eggs on apple juice compared to pure polyamine, they strongly preferred the mixture of apple juice and polyamines to apple juice alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4E Fig</xref>). Similarly, flies laid significantly more eggs onto a substrate that contained sugar and putrescine than on sugar alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4F Fig</xref>). Thus, polyamines are not only beneficial for egg-laying and increase the number of progeny, they also provide and enhance appealing landmarks for oviposition.</p>

<p>The data highlighted that females use combinatorial sensory cues to decide where to lay an egg. We therefore examined which sensory modalities contributed to this short-range decision during oviposition. To facilitate the dissection of sensory mechanisms, we returned to assays using polyamine alone (agarose + polyamine versus agarose) and first determined the role of different sensory organs in polyamine choice during egg-laying. We found that ablation of antennae had no effect on oviposition avoidance to putrescine showing that IR41a/IR76b OSNs were dispensable once the female had closed in on an egg-laying substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4G Fig</xref>). We therefore turned to the other chemosensory modality, gustation. Taste organs are specified during development by the transcription factor Poxn. In <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants, most taste organs with the exception of some taste organs in the pharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref053">53</xref>] are transformed into mechanosensory organs, including those found on the labellum, the legs, and the wings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref055">55</xref>]. Compared to wild type females, the taste-impaired <italic>Poxn</italic> mutant females completely lost their aversion to oviposit onto polyamine-rich substrate and laid their eggs in equal numbers of both sites of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4H Fig</xref>). This phenotype was rescued to wild type levels when <italic>Poxn</italic> was re-expressed using a full-genomic <italic>Poxn</italic> construct that rescued all taste neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4H Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref055">55</xref>]. Therefore, we concluded that the ultimate choice for egg-laying choice depends on GRNs, but does not involve pharyngeal taste neurons. We next sought to determine the external taste organs most critical for the female’s egg-laying decision. To this end, we ablated single taste organs and assayed oviposition behavior. Ablation of the lower segments of front, middle, or hind legs had no effect on the oviposition choice of wildtype females and the majority of eggs were laid on the polyamine-free site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4G Fig</xref>). Similarly, females with clipped wings behaved normally to polyamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4G Fig</xref>). By contrast, ablation of the labellum resulted in equal egg-laying on both sides of the plate and complete loss of oviposition preference, strongly suggesting, together with the <italic>Poxn</italic> mutant data, that polyamine-based oviposition choice requires taste neurons on the fly’s labellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4G Fig</xref>). As we cannot ablate all legs simultaneously, it remains possible that tarsal IR76b neurons also contribute to some extent to the choice. Nevertheless, these other IR76b neurons cannot compensate for the lack of labellar neurons. Thus, gustatory neurons on the labellum are essential to mediate the short-range polyamine choice behavior during egg-laying.</p>
<p>Taste sensilla contain several types of neurons including bitter-, salt-, and sugar-sensitive neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref037">37</xref>]. How flies taste any amine including polyamines is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref037">37</xref>]. We thus sought to determine which taste receptors mediate the gustatory perception of polyamines. Some GRNs express IRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref056">56</xref>]. In contrast to the odor-detecting IR41a, IR76b is expressed in the gustatory system including GRNs of the labellum. These IR76b neurons project to the SEZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Given the requirement of IR76b olfactory neurons in attraction to polyamines, we tested the involvement of their gustatory counterparts in oviposition behavior. Four loss of function mutants of IR76b (e.g., <italic>IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>), as well as the Gal4-mediated neuronal silencing of IR76b neurons (<italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) completely abolished polyamine avoidance during egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4I Fig</xref>). By contrast, mutants for other IRs (e.g., <italic>IR8a and IR25a</italic>) or <italic>ORCO</italic> or silencing of sugar-sensitive neurons (GR5a and GR64f) by Kir2.1 had no effect on polyamine avoidance of pure polyamine-agar substrate during oviposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4I–S4K Fig</xref>). These data implicate labellar IR76b taste neurons into the detection of polyamine taste.</p>
<p>Polyamines are strongly bitter-tasting compounds to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref057">57</xref>]. We tested whether this sensation could trigger the aversion of polyamines in the absence of fruit or sugar (see above). When we silenced bitter-sensing GR66a taste neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref058">58</xref>] during egg-laying, the aversive (pure) polyamine became attractive to these females (<italic>GR66a-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>), which then strongly preferred to lay their eggs on the polyamine-rich otherwise plain substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4K Fig</xref>). These results confirm that polyamines are highly attractive egg-laying substrates and suggest that GR66a neurons may inhibit or counteract such attractiveness. This result also provides a mechanistic explanation for why polyamines in the context of fruit or sugar are highly attractive to flies, because sweet sensation can quench the perception of bitter ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref059">59</xref>] see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). Silencing of both IR76b and GR66a neurons simultaneously (<italic>GR66a-Gal4</italic>,<italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) abolished this preference for the polyamine-rich substrate. This further demonstrates that the attraction to polyamine indeed depends on IR76b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4K Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that IR76b and GR66a are both expressed in taste organs, we carried out double-labeling experiments using genetic reporters to analyze their relative position on the labellum and their axonal projections into the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). We first confirmed that <italic>IR76b-QF</italic> and <italic>IR76b-Gal4</italic> used in the behavioral assays were coexpressed in gustatory neurons. Although the relative expression levels of the two reporters showed some variation, they were by and large coexpressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). We therefore used the <italic>IR76b-QF</italic> reporter to analyze potential expression in GR bitter neurons (<italic>GR66a-Gal4</italic>). Our reporter expression data suggested that these receptors are not expressed in the same neurons in the labellum as the respective axon populations innervated distinct regions of the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s006">S5 Fig</xref>, e.g., SEZ panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]. These results suggest that two different taste neuron populations on the labellum are required to taste and evaluate polyamine-rich egg-laying substrates.</p>
<p>To strengthen this evidence and to confirm that IR76b receptors were indeed required to taste polyamines, we carried out rescue experiments in <italic>IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutant females. Re-expression of IR76b in IR76b receptor neurons (<italic>IR76b-Gal4</italic>,<italic>UAS-IR76b;IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>) resulted in a full rescue of oviposition behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4L Fig</xref>). By contrast, re-expression of IR76b selectively in IR41a OSNs (<italic>IR41a-Gal4</italic>,<italic>UAS-IR76b;IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>) did not rescue oviposition choice confirming that this behavior depended on taste neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4L Fig</xref>). Finally, we re-expressed IR76b in GR66a neurons (<italic>GR66a-Gal4</italic>,<italic>UAS-IR76b;IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> and observed no rescue of the choice behavior confirming that IR76b receptors critical for polyamine taste do not reside in GR66a bitter neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4L Fig</xref>). Hence, the fly receives and integrates two types of information, quality and valence, from one molecule, using two types of taste neurons. Given our data on polyamine and apple juice/sugar, such integration could potentially follow a mechanism that was recently demonstrated for sugar neurons, which are indirectly inhibited by bitter neurons via GABAergic inhibitory neurons of the SEZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref059">59</xref>]. This type of multimodal taste integration would allow the fly to measure the relative levels of polyamines and sugars during the evaluation of food.</p>

<title>Taste Neurons Respond to Polyamines</title>
<p>Our behavioral data provides strong evidence that polyamine sensing in the context of oviposition requires IR76b receptor in taste neurons on the female’s labellum. To test more directly whether taste neurons responded to polyamines, we monitored the response of IR76b neurons to putrescine using in vivo calcium imaging with GCaMP6f (<italic>IR76b-Gal4; UAS-GCaMP6f</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Labellar stimulation with a putrescine solution led to a significant increase in GCaMP-fluorescence in primarily two regions of the SEZ innervated by at least two distinct sets of IR76b taste neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4A–4E</xref>). One of these regions (region of interest [ROI] 1) responded more strongly at for egg-laying behavior relevant concentrations (1 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). By contrast, ROI 2 responded to higher concentrations of polyamine (100 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4C and 4E</xref>). We also observed calcium increases in ROI 1 in IR76b neuron axon terminals upon stimulation with salt consistent with a previous report implicating IR76b in the detection of low salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s007">S6A Fig</xref>, 50 mM NaCl, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]). Given that IR76b neurons are also found on the legs, we tested their responses to polyamines. To this end, we recorded GCaMP-fluorescence directly from the neurons on the tarsae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s007">S6B–S6D Fig</xref>). Our results suggest that polyamine-sensitive tarsal taste neurons exist on all legs and therefore could potentially contribute—although probably to a lesser extent—to the egg-laying choice. Of note, we only observed a significant response to high (100 mM) but not to lower polyamine concentrations (1 mM).</p>

<p>To gain more evidence for a role of IR76b as polyamine receptor, we recorded changes in GCaMP fluorescence in <italic>IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutant flies and found that the response to polyamine was absent in both the ROI 1 and ROI 2 areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4F–4I</xref>). Similarly, the response to salt was also significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s007">S6E Fig</xref>). These results demonstrate that IR76b receptor is required for polyamine detection by GRNs. Together with our behavioral data, these results show that IR76b, in addition to its function as salt receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>], is a taste receptor for polyamines.</p>
<p>We wondered which type of IR76b-expressing labellar GRN detects polyamines. Labellar taste neurons are housed in three types of taste bristles, short (S), intermediate (I), and long (L), as well as in taste pegs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref035">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). L-type GRNs expressing IR76b promote the attraction to low levels of salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]; and IR76b expression as judged by the Gal4 reporter (<italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-mCD8GFP</italic>) can be observed in L-type sensilla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]. In addition, we found that the reporter was strongly expressed in taste pegs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Consistent with this, the innervation of the ROI 1 area in the SEZ by IR76b GRN axons resembled the innervation previously observed for GRNs in taste pegs (e.g., GRNs responding to carbonation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref060">60</xref>]). As the ROI 1 area responded most strongly to behaviorally relevant concentrations of polyamines, it is conceivable that IR76b peg neurons are required for oviposition choice behavior. To test which neurons responded to the taste, we used tip recordings and recorded putative responses of the taste neurons housed in sensilla. In particular, we asked whether L-type sensilla were activated by polyamines. We found that none of the recorded L-type sensilla showed a response to putrescine consistent with our hypothesis that a different GRN type detects polyamines such as the peg neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4K and 4L</xref>). We next tested the responses of S-type sensilla. These sensilla responded significantly to polyamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4K and 4L</xref>), but IR76b did not mediate these responses, as tip recordings on <italic>IR76b</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutants still showed strong responses of S-type sensilla to putrescine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g004">Fig 4L</xref>). Given that bitter receptors are prominent in these sensilla, we hypothesize that bitter receptors such as GR66a might instead mediate these responses consistent with their involvement in oviposition behavior.</p>
<p>We conclude that the fly’s taste sensation of polyamines requires IR76b in labellar GRNs, most likely in peg neurons but not in L-type sensilla that mediate the response to salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]. IR76b is also not required in S-type sensilla, which presumably mediate the bitter taste of these compounds. Finally, it appears that amongst IR76b taste neurons, some are involved in the sensation of polyamines while others sense salt, indicating the involvement of up-to-now unidentified partner receptors for salt and polyamines, respectively.</p>

<title>Multisensory Detection of Polyamines Explain Egg-Laying Behavior</title>
<p>Our data suggest that female flies sense and interpret polyamine odor and taste. To address how flies use and integrate this multisensory input elicited by a single compound during egg-laying site selection, we video-monitored the time flies spend on polyamine-rich compared to control substrate in the setup of the oviposition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To simplify the assay and the interpretation, we carried out the experiments on polyamine-rich substrates devoid of additional odors or tastes. We found that wild type female flies spent significantly more time on the polyamine site (positive position index; solid lines), although they preferred to lay their eggs on the control site (negative oviposition index; dashed lines) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7A Fig</xref>). Notably, flies showed the strongest positional preference for polyamine at the beginning of the experiment, but this preference steadily declined in parallel to an increase of eggs laid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We investigated which of the identified receptor neurons and thus sensory modalities are used for position and oviposition, respectively. Taste neuron-deficient <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants confirmed that oviposition aversion was dependent on taste; <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants showed no aversion and laid their eggs on both sides of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7B and S7C Fig</xref>). By contrast, positional attraction to polyamines remained intact in these flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Of note, <italic>Poxn</italic> mutant females laid significantly less eggs in the first three hours that were observed in this assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7B Fig</xref>). However, in the longer assay as shown above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4H Fig</xref>), the total number of eggs was comparable to controls suggesting that a lack of the sense of taste may initially inhibit the female’s willingness to deposit her eggs.</p>

<p>We found that silencing IR41a OSNs (<italic>IR41a-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) selectively affected position preference and not oviposition avoidance, suggesting that positional preference required olfactory detection of polyamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, females with silenced IR76b neurons (<italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>), which included the IR41a/IR76b OSN population as well as the IR76b taste neurons, were completely indifferent to polyamines in position and oviposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7D Fig</xref>).

Silencing of GR66a bitter taste neurons (<italic>GR66a-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) had no effect on position behavior, but as reported above, reversed oviposition avoidance to preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7D Fig</xref>). Egg numbers were comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, concurrent inactivation of IR76b and bitter tasting neurons (<italic>Gr66a-Gal4</italic>,<italic>IR76b-Gal4;UAS-Kir2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) completely abolished positional and oviposition preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s008">S7D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these data show that odor- and taste-induced behaviors do not depend on each other but rather happen in a parallel or sequential manner. Polyamine odors could be long-range attractive cues for female flies to navigate to putative oviposition sites. Upon arrival on or in close proximity of such sites (a decaying fruit or the confined space of our oviposition assay), the sense of smell is dispensable, and females refine their choice for oviposition with their taste organs, likely integrating polyamine inputs with other tastes (e.g., sugar).</p>

<title>Polyamines Attract <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> Mosquitoes to Egg-Laying Sites</title>
<p>Having shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies use polyamines to identify egg-laying sites, we next investigated a more general role of these compounds beyond the vinegar fly. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes transmit the dangerous disease dengue fever and cause about 25,000 deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref061">61</xref>].

<p>Because <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito adults live in human households and are often found attached to sheets, curtains, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref062">62</xref>], insecticide treatments of adults are often limited by their proximity to humans. Targeting breeding sites might therefore be more practical and efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref063">63</xref>]. Using laboratory oviposition assays, we asked whether <italic>Aedes</italic> females are attracted to the odor of polyamines for egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Single females were released into a caged area and given the choice between laying into a cup that smelled of polyamines and an odorless cup. They were prevented from tasting the compounds in this assay and forced to use their sense of smell. We found that egg-laying female mosquitoes deposit significantly more eggs into water that smelled of putrescine or cadaverine compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). This attraction was concentration-dependent, and mosquitoes were most attracted at 1μM and 10 μM of putrescine or cadaverine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). By contrast, concentrations as of 100 μM started to become repulsive, and females preferred to lay their eggs into the nonsmelling cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we show that polyamines, important biogenic amines, are beneficial components of a diet that increases the reproductive success of <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies. In line with this, flies are highly attracted to polyamines and use them to identify food sites for instance for egg-laying. The decision to approach or lay eggs on polyamine-rich substrates requires multisensory integration of two distinct sensory modalities, olfaction and taste. We have identified the sensory and molecular mechanisms involved in polyamine-guided behavior in both modalities and show that they share the requirement of the IR, IR76b.</p>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Polyamines Are Beneficial Nutrients Involved in Reproductive Success</title>
<p>Polyamines represent an important component of animal nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref012">12</xref>]. Deficiency as well as excess of polyamines can be detrimental to health and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref006">6</xref>]. Therefore, species might have undergone a selection to choose food with levels of polyamines that meet their physiological needs. Our results provide important biological significance for the preference of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> for polyamine-rich food such as fermented fruit or fresh oranges (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref015">15</xref>]). In particular, we show that a polyamine-enriched diet increases the number of offspring produced by a fly couple. Females feeding on polyamine-supplemented food lay significantly more eggs. Mechanistically, we speculate that the diverse and conserved roles of polyamines during cell cycle progression, differentiation, and autophagy among others are responsible for the beneficial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref005">5</xref>]. Interestingly, in addition to uptake through the diet, polyamine-synthesis enzymes (i.e., ornithine decarboxylase) are selectively up-regulated after mating in the spermatheca of female mosquitoes, a tissue involved in sperm storage, egg-production, and laying in mosquito and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, consistent with a role in fertility and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
<p>Conception and proper embryonic development depend on polyamines also in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref005">5</xref>]. Polyamines also form a substantial part of the male ejaculate (i.e., spermine and spermidine) and infertile men show lower levels of spermine, spermidine, and putrescine in their semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref005">5</xref>]. Interestingly, polyamine-synthesizing enzymes in the cell decay with age, spurring studies on the beneficial effects of polyamines in the diet. Polyamine supplementation might counteract age-related loss of fertility in men and women, but also other ageing-induced deficits such as loss of memory or even lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref011">11</xref>]. On the other hand, an excess of these compounds in the cell, and therefore possibly in the diet has been linked with the occurrence and progression of cancer and other diseases suggesting that polyamine intake should be carefully regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref006">6</xref>]. With the characterization of sensory mechanisms underpinning the attraction to polyamines, we can begin to analyze how fundamental physiological needs shape sensory processing and ultimately impinge on feeding and reproductive behavior.</p>

<title>Multisensory Detection of Polyamines</title>
<p>Flies detect the odor and taste of polyamines. In addition, our data suggests that two types of gustatory neurons evaluate quality and valence of polyamines separately. The female to identify egg-laying sites uses these two taste modalities, polyamine taste and bitter taste. In this context and presumably during feeding, sugar in the fruit appear to override the bitter taste of polyamines, which translates at the behavioral level to a preference for polyamine-rich compared to polyamine-poor fruity substrates. This claim is supported by data showing that female flies strongly prefer to lay their eggs into pure polyamine substrates when their bitter sense is silenced genetically. Therefore, several modalities contribute to polyamine choice behavior. Such multimodal detection of polyamines might ensure that the animal only consumes polyamines in the context of a suitable food source and at beneficial concentrations. A similar interaction was suggested between sugar and bitter taste sensation in the fly, indicating that concentrations might be generally estimated by assessing the relative amounts of tastants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref066">66</xref>]. Multimodal taste experiences are essential to judge food quality also for humans. Therefore, sugar is frequently used to quench bitter tastes in food and to make medication more palatable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref067">67</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to integrating two types of taste modalities, flies also appear to use their sense of smell to find polyamine-rich foods. Our tracking data shows that these two kinds of information, smell and taste, are used sequentially consistent with odor being a long-range and taste a short-range signal. Flies that have found the source of the polyamine using their sense of smell do no longer require it to make the decision on where to lay eggs. However, whether odor and tastes are integrated in a more complex odor/taste environment of polyamines and other cues remains to be investigated.</p>

<title>IR76b Receptors Are Required to Detect the Smell and Taste of Polyamines</title>
<p>Our behavioral data shows that flies are attracted to all polyamines tested including putrescine, spermine, and cadaverine. Notably, they appear to prefer concentrations that are typically found in fermented foods, overripe fruit, or oranges, also a favorite of flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref015">15</xref>]. The receptor IR76b is required for the detection of the odor as well as the taste. Mutants for <italic>IR76b</italic> show significantly reduced attraction to polyamines. In this context, IR76b seems to work with another receptor, IR41a, which is specific to a very small subset (~7) of antennal OSNs. Although IR76b is more broadly expressed than IR41a in the olfactory system, it is unclear whether it plays the role of a coreceptor like IR8a or IR25a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref031">31</xref>]. IR25a, which appears to be coexpressed with IR76b and IR41a, could play this role in polyamine detection. However, <italic>IR25a</italic> mutant flies show no decrease in polyamine attraction compared to controls. Thus, it is possible that IR76b and IR41a work as functional receptor heteromers, a configuration that is necessary and sufficient to form functional chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Notably, the effect of the <italic>IR76b</italic> mutation in calcium imaging of OSNs appeared significantly stronger than the effect of the mutation in odor-guided behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g002">Fig 2</xref>), although IR76b and the IR41a glomerulus appeared to be necessary and sufficient to mediate polyamine odor attraction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This difference could be due to the slightly different conditions in behavior and imaging. On the one hand, animals are freely moving during behavior and might experience odor plumes rather than constant streams. On the other hand, animals are exposed for longer periods of times to the odor in the T-maze as compared to the imaging experiments. These effects might also explain a discrepancy between our behavioral data and a previous study implicating the IR coreceptor IR8a in the detection of putrescine using single sensillum electrophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref031">31</xref>]. As mentioned above the same <italic>IR8a</italic> loss of function mutants as used by Abuin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref031">31</xref>] did not show any significant reduction in polyamine odor attraction in behavioral assays.</p>
<p>In the gustatory system, IR76b expressed in labellar GRNs is necessary and sufficient to mediate polyamine choice behavior. In contrast to the olfactory system, a mutation in <italic>IR76b</italic> results in complete loss of preference behavior to polyamines as well as a loss of calcium responses in GRNs. Calcium imaging and tip recording along with expression data indicate that polyamines are not recognized by IR76b expressed in L-type or S-type sensilla on the labellum, but instead might be detected by peg taste neurons that express IR76b. Furthermore, IR76b taste neurons on the leg, although not essential for egg-laying decisions, responded to polyamines. Based on our data, we can exclude and infer the involvement of certain types of IR76b taste neurons for polyamine detection, but further experiments will be required to reveal their exact identity and position.</p>
<p>A previous study showed that IR76b in L-type neurons was required for the fly’s attraction to low levels of salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]. How can the same receptor mediate two or more different taste modalities? The easiest explanation might be the involvement of at least one coreceptor for either salt or polyamine. Given that IR76b expressing L-type sensilla do not respond to polyamines, this appears to be a likely scenario at least for the detection of polyamines. Up to now, our candidate approaches, however, have not identified such a coreceptor. The other possibility is that the same receptor has putative binding sites for both of these ligands. In fact, ORs with few exceptions such as the CO<sub>2</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref026">26</xref>] detect multiple odorants. Nevertheless, salt and polyamines appear to be very different types of ligands. The activation of IR76b receptor by salt seems to depend on a particular amino acid located in the transmembrane domain, which is required for ion conductance in ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref040">40</xref>]. The authors propose that this amino acid will keep the channel in a constitutively open or partly open position, which allows sodium entry when GRNs contact salt.</p>
<p>The structural similarity of IRs and iGluRs might provide hints for how polyamines could activate IRs. Polyamines are released from presynaptic terminals and can thus interact with the extracellular domains of synaptic iGluRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref068">68</xref>]. Such interactions appear to modulate the activity of some iGluRs (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref069">69</xref>]). For instance, spermine can potentiate the activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor by binding at a site within the extracellular domains of one of the subunits, the NR1 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref071">71</xref>]. Comparison of the putative structures of IR41a and IR76b and the structure of the NR1 subunit shows that these receptors share a high structural similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s009">S8 Fig</xref>). It is thus conceivable that polyamine activation of IR41a and IR76b follows a similar mechanism as polyamine potentiation of NMDAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref072">72</xref>]. Structure–function analysis guided by studies on the NMDAR will help to test this model. It is certainly exciting to speculate that the binding and modulation by polyamines has been acquired early on in the evolution of iGluRs and further optimized in specific IRs.</p>

<title>T-maze assay</title>
<p>The use of the T-maze assay is indicated in all figures with a fly head schematic with red colored antennae to show that polyamine preference depends on OSNs on the antenna. Five to seven days old flies raised at 25°C were used for all experiments with the exception of experiments where RNAi was used. For these experiments, flies were raised at 30°C to increase the efficacy of RNAi. Flies were tested in groups of ~60 (30 females and 30 males or 60 females) in a T-maze and were allowed 1 min to respond to stimuli. Experimentation was carried out within climate controlled boxes at 25°C and 60% rH in the dark. 50 μl of fresh odor solution at different concentrations diluted in distilled water applied on Whatman chromatography paper was provided in the odor tube while 50 μl of distilled water (polyamine solvent) applied on Whatman chromatography paper was placed into the control tube. Unless otherwise indicated 1 mM (according to photo-ionization detector (PID) measurements corresponds to ~10 ppm) of either putrescine or cadaverine were used. After experimentation, the number of flies in each tube was counted. An olfactory PI was calculated by subtracting the number of flies on the test odor site from the number of flies on the control site and normalizing by the total number of flies. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni multiple comparisons post-hoc test using Prism GraphPad 6.</p>

<title>Oviposition assay</title>
<p>The oviposition assay is indicated in all figures by an illustration of the fly head with a red-labeled proboscis showing that oviposition preference depends on labellar taste neurons. In addition, oviposition assays are shown in simple schemes in most figures. Here, the gray circle shows the oviposition plate filled with 1% agarose and the colored squares indicate the addition of putrescine or cadaverine on one half of the plate. Unless otherwise stated 1 mM of polyamine was used in all assays. Five to seven day old flies raised at 25°C were used for all experiments with the exception of experiments where RNAi was used. For these experiments, flies were raised at 30°C to increase the efficacy of RNAi. Mated female flies, reared on standard cornmeal medium at 25°C and 60% rH, were separated on ice from male flies at day 4 d posteclosion. Female flies were kept for two more days on fly food and used on day 6 for the oviposition assays. 1% low melting agarose was poured in 60 x 15 mm petri dish, and two halves were marked with a permanent marker on the bottom of the dish. 50 μl of polyamine solution at different concentrations was applied on one site (test) of the dish. In initial experiments, we also tested odor mixed into 1% low melting agarose compared to agarose only and obtained the same results as with applying the polyamine solution onto the hardened agarose. 60 female flies were put in a gauzed top round cage and the cage was closed with the test petri dish. Flies were kept for exactly 16 h in a light:dark cycle at controlled temperature and humidity conditions. An oviposition PI was calculated by subtracting the number of eggs on the test site from the number of eggs on the control site and normalized by the total number of eggs. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni multiple comparisons posthoc test using Prism GraphPad 6.</p>

Behavior of flies was video-tracked, and position preference of flies was quantified in 30 min time intervals. The number of eggs was quantified also every 30 min for 3 h. Position and oviposition preference indices were calculated as described above for individual time points.

<p><italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> (Rockefeller strain) were reared at 27 ± 2°C, 70 ± 2% RH under a 12 h:12 h light:dark period. Larvae were reared in plastic containers (20 x 18 x 7 cm) and fed Superwhite fishfood (Tropical, Poland). Pupae were transferred into 20 ml plastic cups and placed into Bugdorm-1 cages (Megaview, Taiwan; 30 x 30 x 30 cm). Adults had ad libitum access to 10% sucrose presented on a filter paper. Four to six days post emergence, females were starved for 6 h prior being offered defibrillated sheep blood (Håtuna lab, Sweden) through a membrane feeding system (Hemotek Ltd, UK). After taking a full blood meal, the females were transferred to the experimental chamber for oviposition experiments. Females had ad libitum access to the sucrose solution.</p>

<title>Oviposition assay</title>
<p>Oviposition assays were performed in a climate chamber maintained under the same conditions as the rearing chamber. The assays consisted of a Bugdorm-1 cage with two oviposition cups diagonally oriented at a distance of 20 cm from each other. Four separate cups made up an oviposition cup. In the bottom, a transparent 250 ml cup (Houseware Nordic Business Association AB, Sweden), filled with 1 ml of the test compound or control (water). Two paper cups (230 ml; Clas Ohlson, Sweden), the first with a 10 mm centre hole and the second with eight 1 mm piercings, were stacked into the plastic cup. In the second paper cup, a 30 ml cup (Nolato Hertila, Sweden), with a folded filter paper (Munktell Filter AB, Sweden) and 5 ml dH2O, provided the oviposition substrate. Four days post blood meal, female mosquitoes were transferred from the rearing cage to individual test cages where they were deprived of the sucrose solution. Female <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> were then allowed to oviposit for three consecutive L:D cycles after which the number of eggs laid in the test cup and control cup were counted.

<p>Adult fly brains were dissected, fixed and stained as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref074">74</xref>]. Briefly, brains were dissected in cold PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde (2%, overnight at 4°C or for 2 h at RT), washed in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% donkey serum, and stained overnight at 4°C or for 2 h at RT with the primary and after washes in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 with the secondary antibody using the same conditions. All microscopic observations were made at an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope. Images were processed using ImageJ and Photoshop. The following antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (molecular probes, 1:100), rabbit anti-Dsred (Clontech, Living colors DsRed polyclonal AB, 1:200), and rat anti-N-cadherin (anti-N-cad DN-Ex #8, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1:100).

<title>In vivo calcium imaging</title>
<p>For calcium imaging experiments, GCaMP6f was expressed under the control of IR41a-Gal4 or IR76b-Gal4. In vivo preparations of flies were prepared according to a method previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref074">74</xref>]. In vivo preparations were imaged using a Leica DM6000FS fluorescent microscope equipped with a 40x water immersion objective and a Leica DFC360 FX fluorescent camera. All images were acquired with the Leica LAS AF E6000 image acquisition suit. Images were acquired for 20 s at a rate of 20 frames per s with 4 x 4 binning mode. During all measurements the exposure time was kept constant at 20 ms. For all experiments with odor stimulation, the stimulus was applied 5 s after the start of each measurement. A continuous and humidified airstream (2000 ml/min) was delivered to the fly throughout the experiment via an 8 mm diameter glass tube positioned 10 mm away from the preparation. A custom-made odor delivery system (Smartec, Martinsried), consisting of mass flow controllers (MFCs) and solenoid valves, was used for delivering a continuous airstream and stimuli in all experiments. In all experiments stimuli were delivered for 500 ms and during stimulations the continuous flow was maintained at 2,000 ml/min. A continuous and humidified airstream (2,000 ml/min) was delivered to the fly head throughout the experiment via an 8 mm diameter glass tube positioned 10 mm away from the preparation. For putrescine stimulation, 1 ml of odor solution (0 mM (air stimulus), 1 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM diluted in pure water) was filled in the odor delivery cup and the collected airspace odor was injected into the main airstream for 500 ms without changing airstream strength. PID measurements suggested that 100 mM corresponded to ~10 ppm of odor and therefore compared best to the optimal concentration used in behavioral experiments. To measure the fluorescent intensity change, the ROI was delineated by hand and the resulting time trace was used for further analysis. To calculate the normalized change in the relative fluorescence intensity, we used the following formula: ΔF/F = 100(Fn − F0)/F0, where Fn is the nth frame after stimulation and F0 is the averaged basal fluorescence of 15 frames before stimulation. The peak fluorescence intensity change is calculated as the mean of normalized trace over a 2 s time window during the stimulation period. The pseudocolored images were generated in MATLAB using a custom written program. All analysis and statistical tests were done using Excel and GraphPad6 Prism softwares, respectively.</p>
<p>Imaging with taste stimuli was performed in a similar setup as described above with some modifications. The flies expressing GCaMP-fluorescence under IR76b-Gal4 were prepared according to a method previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref075">75</xref>]. The proboscis of the fly was pulled out by suction and fixed by gluing to prevent it from going back into the head capsule. For taste stimulation, taste stimuli were diluted in distilled water and delivered by a custom-build syringe delivery system to the proboscis. Distilled water (control), 1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM putrescine were applied, respectively. Application of the stimulus was monitored by a stereomicroscope. A drop of taste was delivered to touch the labellum. The stimulus was applied for 1 s after the start of each measurement. Imaging of leg IR76b taste neurons was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref076">76</xref>]. Briefly, legs were detached from the body of the fly and glued to double-sided tape on a slide. 100 μl of water were added to the free lower segments of the leg to help focus the preparation on the IR76b neurons. For stimulation, different concentrations of 100 μl polyamine solution were added as 2 x to the water. All analysis and statistical tests were done using Excel and GraphPad6 Prism softwares as described above.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Tip recordings were carried out as previously described tip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref077">77</xref>] with minor modifications. Female flies at 5–7 d after eclosion were used for all experiments. Legs and wings were removed to reduce movement. For recording, the flies were wedged into the narrow neck of a 200 μl pipette tip. The proboscis was extended and pasted by double-sided tape on a cover slide. The tip of a glass micropipette was used to hold the proboscis in a stable position. A reference electrode containing 0.01 mM KCL was inserted into the eye of the fly. The recording electrode consisted of a fine glass pipette (10–15 μm tip diameter) and a silver wire connected to an amplifier. The recording electrode played the dual function of recording and container for the stimulus. Recording started the moment that the recording electrode contacted the tip of the sensillum. The polyamine solution used for stimulation contained 30 mM tricholine citrate (TCC) as the electrolyte to suppress responses from the osmolarity-sensitive taste neuron. To avoid desensitization, stimuli were given at least 3 min apart. In all recordings, concentrations were increased sequentially and a control stimulus without polyamine was applied first in all cases. Recordings were performed on L-type and S-type sensilla on the labial palp. The recording electrode was connected to an amplifier Multiclamp 700B, and the AC signals (10–2,800 Hz) were recorded for 2–3 s, starting before stimulation, recorded and analyzed using Clampex10.3 (Digidata 1440A). The responses of neuron firing were calculated by counting the number of action potentials from 200 to 700 ms after initial contact, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002454.ref074">74</xref>].</p>

<title>IR76b and Gr66a are not coexpressed in labellar taste neurons.</title>
<p>Expression analysis of IR76b (<italic>IR76b-QF;QUAS-mdTomato-3xHa</italic>) and Gr66a (<italic>Gr66a-Gal4;UASmCD8GFP</italic>) in proboscis, brain (SEZ), and legs. No coexpression could be observed in neurons of the labellum and axons projecting from these to the SEZ innervated neighboring regions and did not overlap. Coexpressing cells were occasionally found in the leg. The legs, however, were redundant for fly’s taste preference behavior. Confocal images were taken at an Olympus Confocal microscope. Step size 0.5 μM. Single sections or small stacks are shown.</p>

<title>Egg numbers after 3 h of egg laying.</title>
<p>(A–D) Graphs display the number of eggs females laid in the first 3 h of a position–oviposition assay on control (1% low melting agarose) or stimulus (agarose plus polyamines) site corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002454.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Note that the low number of eggs in some test lines reflects the slow start of oviposition due to genetic or other manipulations. Egg numbers caught up later significantly (see for instance <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002454.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). However, it is important to interpret some of the oviposition preferences with caution due to the low number of eggs.
