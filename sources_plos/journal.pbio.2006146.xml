<abstract>
<p>Stress responses are crucial processes that require activation of genetic programs that protect from the stressor. Stress responses are also energy consuming and can thus be deleterious to the organism. The mechanisms coordinating energy consumption during stress response in multicellular organisms are not well understood. Here, we show that loss of the epigenetic regulator G9a in <italic>Drosophila</italic> causes a shift in the transcriptional and metabolic responses to oxidative stress (OS) that leads to decreased survival time upon feeding the xenobiotic paraquat. During OS exposure, G9a mutants show overactivation of stress response genes, rapid depletion of glycogen, and inability to access lipid energy stores. The OS survival deficiency of G9a mutants can be rescued by a high-sugar diet. Control flies also show improved OS survival when fed a high-sugar diet, suggesting that energy availability is generally a limiting factor for OS tolerance. Directly limiting access to glycogen stores by knocking down glycogen phosphorylase recapitulates the OS-induced survival defects of G9a mutants. We propose that G9a mutants are sensitive to stress because they experience a net reduction in available energy due to (1) rapid glycogen use, (2) an inability to access lipid energy stores, and (3) an overinduced transcriptional response to stress that further exacerbates energy demands. This suggests that G9a acts as a critical regulatory hub between the transcriptional and metabolic responses to OS. Our findings, together with recent studies that established a role for G9a in hypoxia resistance in cancer cell lines, suggest that G9a is of wide importance in controlling the cellular and organismal response to multiple types of stress.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Stress responses require proper activation of genetic programs to protect the organism from the stressor. However, the mechanisms controlling energy consumption during stress responses are not well understood. Here, we investigate the role of epigenetic modifier G9a in regulating metabolism and gene transcription during oxidative stress responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Flies lacking G9a show a shift in the metabolic and transcriptional responses to oxidative stress, leading to decreased stress tolerance despite intact oxidative stress defense mechanisms. During oxidative stress exposure, G9a mutants show overactivation of stress response and many other genes, rapid depletion of glycogen energy stores, and an inability to access lipid energy stores. The increased susceptibility of G9a mutant flies to oxidative stress can be rescued simply by providing extra sugar. This suggests that G9a mutants are sensitive to stress because of reduced access to immediately available energy. Wild-type flies also become more tolerant to oxidative stress when they are fed extra sugar, whereas blocking energy access by genetically reducing a key metabolic enzyme leads to oxidative stress sensitivity. Though the genetic response to oxidative stress has long been appreciated, our study emphasizes the importance of energy metabolism for stress tolerance and identifies the histone methyltransferase G9a as an important player regulating both.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of an organism to sense and adapt to changes in the environment is essential for survival. In particular, harmful environmental challenges require acute responses to avoid cellular and organismal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref001">1</xref>]. The coordinated regulation of stress response genes coupled with a reallocation of cellular energy use is required to implement effective cellular stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref003">3</xref>]. In extreme cases, translation of non-stress-related proteins is repressed, and cellular energy stores become primarily dedicated to the stress response, at the expense of other normal cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref004">4</xref>]. Little is known about the regulators that safeguard an appropriate amplitude of stress response and ensure sufficient cellular resources to execute an effective defense.</p>
<p>Conserved defense mechanisms have evolved to counteract stress such as heat shock, DNA damage, and oxidative stress (OS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref005">5</xref>]. Exposure to xenobiotics such as paraquat or hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) can lead to increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS triggers multiple signaling pathways, which activate key transcription factors such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref006">6</xref>], activator protein 1 (AP-1) (D-Fos/D-jun) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref007">7</xref>], forkhead box O (FoxO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref008">8</xref>], and activating transcription factor 3 (Atf-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref009">9</xref>]. These transcription factors induce the expression of ROS scavengers (superoxide dismutases [SODs], catalases, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases) and genes involved in the repair of ROS-mediated damage (peroxiredoxins, proteasomal components, DNA repair machinery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent studies have indicated that chromatin regulators are critical factors in mediating the cellular response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref012">12</xref>]. Chromatin modifiers of the evolutionarily conserved G9a/euchromatin histone methyltransferase (EHMT) protein family mediate histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) within euchromatic regions the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref013">13</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that G9a is required for hypoxia resistance during the rapid proliferation of cancer cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref015">15</xref>]. At the organismal level, G9a is important in mediating responses to various environmental insults and stimuli, including viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref016">16</xref>], starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref018">18</xref>], cocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref020">20</xref>], and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref022">22</xref>]. Previously, we characterized putative genomic H3K9me2 target sites of G9a in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. These G9a target sites were enriched at genes that are regulated in environmentally induced processes requiring immediate responses, including memory, immune response, and response to OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref022">22</xref>]. Whereas the former were demonstrated to be predictive for defects in learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref022">22</xref>] and immune responses to virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref016">16</xref>] of G9a-null mutant flies, the biological relevance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> G9a OS-related targets has remained elusive.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrate an essential role for G9a in OS tolerance. Our data suggest that G9a mutants experience an overactivated stress response, elevated glycogen use, and an inability to access lipid energy reserves, resulting in premature death due to reduced net energy availability. This defines G9a as an important regulator of transcriptional and metabolic homeostasis that is required for an optimal metabolic response to stress.</p>

<title>G9a is required for optimal survival in response to paraquat-induced OS</title>
<p>To investigate whether G9a is required for OS response, we exposed G9a-null mutants (<italic>G9a</italic><sup><italic>DD1</italic></sup> and <italic>G9a</italic><sup><italic>DD2</italic></sup>) and an isogenic control strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref022">22</xref>] to paraquat, a potent inducer of OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref023">23</xref>]. Scoring survival of the three genotypes over time, we found that G9a mutants showed reduced survival upon paraquat exposure, dying dramatically faster than the controls. In contrast, untreated G9a-null mutants and controls showed full viability over the time course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). To independently verify this finding, we also generated G9a knockdown flies and exposed them to paraquat. Knocking down G9a using the ubiquitous <italic>actin-Gal4</italic> driver and a previously validated <italic>G9a</italic> RNA interference (RNAi) line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref024">24</xref>] also led to a significant reduction in median survival time during exposure to paraquat compared to controls. Untreated G9a-knockdown and control flies were viable over the time course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The observation that two <italic>G9a</italic>-null alleles and G9a-knockdown flies show reduced survival in response to paraquat suggests that G9a may play a role in OS response. G9a mutant flies were also sensitive to the OS-inducing agent menadione sodium bisulfide (MSB) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), demonstrating that the sensitivity to OS is not specific to paraquat.</p>

<title>G9a mutants show a highly augmented transcriptional response to OS</title>
<p>Previous chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) profiling of H3K9me2, the epigenetic mark deposited by G9a, in G9a mutants versus control larvae revealed that genes implicated in OS are enriched among putative G9a target genes. Based on this finding and the increased susceptibility of G9a mutants to OS, we hypothesized that G9a may be required for an appropriate transcriptional response to OS. To address this hypothesis and to uncover specific mechanisms underlying OS sensitivity of G9a mutant flies, we assessed gene expression changes in G9a mutants over a time course of OS exposure. For this, we generated transcriptome profiles by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of G9a mutant and control heads at 0, 6, and 12 h after paraquat exposure. We mapped reads to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> reference genome and created normalized count data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Materials and methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s011">S1 Data</xref>). Euclidean sample-to-sample distance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) showed that (1) biological duplicates cluster together, (2) controls and G9a mutants with no OS exposure cluster apart from each other, (3) samples with OS exposure cluster apart from samples with no OS exposure, and (4) G9a mutant samples after 6 and 12 h OS exposure cluster apart from the control samples with OS exposure. These findings suggest that there are differences in the global transcriptional response to OS in G9a mutants compared to controls. Principal component analysis confirms that sample duplicates cluster closely together. It also illustrates that transcriptional changes upon OS are more dramatic in the mutants than in the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). To identify differentially expressed (DE) genes, we used DESeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref025">25</xref>], with cutoffs of ≥1.5-fold change and <italic>p</italic>-adj ≤ 0.05. We performed four pairwise comparisons: 0 h versus 6 h OS exposure and 0 h versus 12 h OS exposure in controls and in G9a mutants. We found 2,731 genes to be differentially expressed in at least one of the four pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s012">S2A Data</xref>). To reveal patterns in global gene expression changes among the two genotypes during OS exposure, we used the partitioning around medoids (PAM) R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref026">26</xref>] to identify 12 clusters of genes with similar expression changes in response to OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Some of these 12 clusters showed a similar pattern across the four conditions, varying mostly by the amplitude of the changes. These were pooled, resulting in five principal groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s012">S2A Data</xref>). Genes in group 1 (271 genes, cluster 1) were up-regulated upon OS exposure in both G9a mutants and controls to a similar extent. Group 2 (384 genes, cluster 2) represents genes that were down-regulated in both G9a mutants and controls. Group 3 (1,139 genes, clusters 3–7), the largest group, includes genes that were induced by OS in control and mutant conditions but to a larger extent in G9a mutants. Group 4 (285 genes, clusters 8–10) represents genes that were up-regulated in the controls but down-regulated in G9a mutants. Group 5 (652 genes, clusters 11 and 12) contains genes that were down-regulated in the control and mutant conditions but to a larger extent in G9a mutants.</p>

<p>Next, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to obtain a global understanding of the biological function associated with the genes in the five principle groups described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2B</xref> (complete GO statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s013">S3A Data</xref>). We identified several GO terms related to stress response in the large group 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, highlighted in yellow, e.g., response to toxic substances, response to stimulus, regulation of translation, immune system process, protein folding, response to stress), which contained genes that were up-regulated in response to OS but more up-regulated in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Thus, G9a mutants show an augmented transcriptional response to OS. In addition, many metabolic terms were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, highlighted in brown). This was especially evident for group 5 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, e.g., lipid metabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, carbohydrate transport, steroid metabolic processes, generation of precursor metabolites, and energy and cellular amino acid metabolic processes), which were down-regulated in response to stress but more down-regulated in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We also investigated an alternative RNA-seq data analysis approach by performing pairwise comparisons of transcriptional changes in G9a mutants versus control at each of the three time points: 0, 6, and 12 h of OS exposure (cutoffs of ≥1.5-fold change and <italic>p</italic>-adj ≤ 0.05). Using this approach, we identified 2,600 DE genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s012">S2B Data</xref>). By PAM clustering of DE genes, as described above, we again identified five principle gene expression groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We found similar patterns of expression changes and comparable representation of biological process within five different principal groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s003">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s013">S3B Data</xref>). For example, group 3 of this alternative analysis contained many stress genes that were up-regulated in G9a mutants only at 6 and 12 h after OS but not at 0 h in steady-state conditions. Group 5 of the alternative analysis contained many metabolic genes that were down-regulated in G9a mutants after 6 and 12 h of OS exposure but not at 0 h in steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Taken together, we consistently see augmented activation of stress response genes and reduced expression of metabolic genes in G9a mutants after exposure to OS.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Transcriptional overactivation of OS defense mechanisms in G9a mutants</title>
<p>We initially hypothesized that the strongly reduced survival of G9a mutants in response to OS may be due to the inability to initiate the transcriptional defense mechanisms protecting against OS. It was thus surprising to identify stress response genes to be enriched in group 3, characterized by an exaggerated transcriptional response in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We therefore further analyzed specific genes encoding proteins that function in neutralizing ROS and oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). SOD catalyzes transformation of oxygen radicals (<sup>•</sup>O<sup>−</sup><sub>2</sub>) into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Catalase, glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, and thioredoxins help to reduce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to water. Examining OS-induced expression changes of these enzymes, we found similar expression in G9a mutants and controls at steady state. Upon OS exposure, we observed an increase in mRNA levels after 6 h and even more after 12 h of OS exposure, a response that was augmented in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The most striking examples for augmented induction by OS are <italic>glutathione S-transferase E1</italic> (<italic>GstE1</italic>) (fold increase at 12 h after OS = 1.8 in controls versus 22.1 in G9a mutants, <italic>p</italic> = 0.017, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, bottom left) and <italic>peroxiredoxin 2540–1</italic> (<italic>Prx2450-1</italic>) (fold increase at 12 h after OS = 2.2 in controls versus 10.5 in G9a mutants, <italic>p</italic> = 0.025, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, middle right). These expression differences were validated in independent quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). <italic>GstE1</italic>, <italic>Prx2450-1</italic>, and <italic>Catalase</italic> (<italic>Cat</italic>) were previously predicted to be G9a targets by H3K9me2 ChIP-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref022">22</xref>], suggesting that G9a might be required to buffer the stress-induced induction of some OS response genes. These data show that G9a mutants are not defective in their ability to induce expression of OS response genes but rather show increased induction.</p>

<p>Cellular ROS can react with and cause damage of lipids, DNA, and proteins. We therefore further surveyed the expression of protein groups that counteract ROS-mediated damage. These included glutathione S-transferases, which are responsible for detoxifying peroxidized lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), DNA damage repair machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), and genes encoding components of the proteasome complex, a key organelle in clearing damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In general, genes involved in these processes are not differentially expressed in G9a mutants under steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3C–3E</xref>, G9a null versus control after 0 h OS). At 6 h and 12 h OS, glutathione S-transferase genes show a trend toward increased expression in controls, which is somewhat augmented in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). DNA repair genes show no induction after OS in controls or G9a mutants, with the exception of some outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). For genes encoding components of the proteasome, we observed a trend toward increased expression in controls after OS exposure, and this increase was significantly higher in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, G9a null versus controls after 6 h OS: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0012, G9a null versus control after 12 h OS: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0011). Together, our data indicate that G9a mutants show an intact and even exaggerated transcriptional response of genes implicated in OS defense.</p>

<title>No accumulation of ROS or ROS-induced damage in G9a mutants</title>
<p>Having identified that the transcription of OS defense genes was enhanced in G9a mutants, we set out to measure markers of OS and oxidative damage in G9a mutants and controls upon OS induction. We measured H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, an intermediate ROS metabolite used as a marker for ROS levels. G9a mutants already had significantly higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at steady state (0 h OS) compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> remained unchanged for up to 18 h after OS exposure, which was the latest time point at which we were able to collect sufficient living G9a mutant animals to perform measurements. We also estimated lipid peroxidation as a marker for oxidative damage, by quantifying malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in G9a mutants and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We observed similar levels of MDA in both genotypes at steady state (0 h OS) and no changes in MDA levels upon OS induction. This indicates that G9a mutants are not defective in clearing ROS or eliminating molecules that are damaged by ROS, in agreement with the transcriptional data. In addition, we tried to rescue the G9a mutant OS sensitivity by feeding the antioxidants vitamin E and glutathione at concentrations that have previously been shown to counteract harmful effects of OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref028">28</xref>].

<title>G9a mutants show altered regulation of metabolic genes driving energy storage and usage</title>
<p>The results obtained above strongly suggested mechanisms other than an impaired stress response to underlie reduced survival of G9a mutants in response to OS. We therefore turned to the second predominant biological theme of misregulated genes: genes involved in metabolism. We examined OS-induced expression changes for genes encoding the main enzymes that drive energy use and storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7</xref> Figs).

Upon OS induction, there were no global changes in expression of genes involved in glycogen metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenases, citric acid cycle, ketogenesis, ketolysis, or mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5B–5L</xref>). There were also no significant differences in expression of these genes in G9a mutants compared to controls after OS induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). However, we noticed that specific genes regulating fatty acid beta oxidation showed highly diverging expression changes (in either direction, up and down) in response to OS in the G9a mutants compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7</xref> Figs). Genes involved in triglyceride synthesis showed a clear trend toward augmented down-regulation in G9a mutants upon both 6 h and 12 h of OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7</xref> Figs).

<title>G9a mutants show accelerated glycogen consumption and failure to mobilize triglycerides during OS exposure</title>
<p>Having observed misregulation of several genes involved in fat metabolism (see fatty acid beta oxidation and triglyceride synthesis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7</xref> Figs) and energy use (<italic>Ldh</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5M</xref>) in G9a mutant heads at steady state and upon OS induction, we asked whether G9a mutants show altered energy use during OS exposure. In controls, glycogen stores were gradually depleted at a rate of −0.29 normalized glycogen units (ngu)/h over the time course of OS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Although glycogen levels were 2.5-fold higher in G9a mutants at steady state compared to controls (G9a mutants = 19.75 ngu, controls = 7.73 ngu, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), glycogen stores got depleted at a much higher, exponential rate (−0.99 ngu/h) in G9a mutants, reaching values lower than in controls after 12 h of OS. These differences in glycogen metabolism might be mediated through posttranslational modifications rather than transcriptional changes, since mRNA levels of glycogen regulators were overall not significantly different in G9a mutants versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Similar to glycogen energy stores, triglyceride levels were also highly increased in G9a mutants at steady state when compared to controls (G9a mutants = 462.81 normalized triglyceride units [ntu], controls = 150.06 ntu, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Upon OS exposure, triglyceride levels gradually decreased in control flies at a rate of −4.68 ntu/h (controls 0 h versus 18 h, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In contrast, triglyceride levels in the G9a mutants did not decrease during OS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In agreement with the measured high triglyceride levels in G9a mutants, histological sectioning revealed that G9a mutant heads, in comparison to controls, presented with a striking increase in overall pericerebral fat body size and in lipid droplet diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Thus, G9a mutant heads showed a dramatic increase in steady-state energy stores and showed altered use of these stores during the OS response. This is consistent with the observed misregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in G9a mutants at steady state and during OS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>We asked whether the observed differences of energy stores between G9a mutants at steady state and during OS exposure are due to differences in feeding. We found that G9a mutants have normal food intake; they eat neither more at steady state nor less upon OS exposure, as could be expected in light of increased steady-state energy stores and quickly declining glycogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data show that <italic>G9a</italic> mutants rapidly used up glycogen during the OS response, and they failed to mobilize triglycerides. The data also indicate that the observed differences in energy stores result from transcriptional and metabolic dysregulation that occurs despite normal food intake.</p>

<title>G9a is required for proper OS response in tissues that regulate energy homeostasis</title>
<p>Because the results above revealed abnormal energy consumption and metabolic dysregulation in G9a mutants, we investigated the role of G9a in tissues regulating energy homeostasis. We performed tissue-specific knockdown of G9a in fat body tissue using the <italic>lsp2-Gal4</italic> driver, in insulin-secreting cells using the <italic>dilp2-Gal4</italic> driver, and in all neurons using the <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body is the main organ for energy storage and important for energy homeostasis during growth and development as well as in immediate energy release in response to environmental stressors such as starvation, infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref016">16</xref>], and OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref029">29</xref>]. G9a knockdown in the fat body reduced survival upon OS, demonstrating a crucial function of G9a in fat body tissue during OS induction by paraquat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptide 2 (dilp2) neurons have a neuroendocrine function and are responsible for orchestrating hormonal regulation of energy storage and release via secretion of dilps, which act on fat body, muscles, gut, and other organs involved in uptake, storage, synthesis, and release of energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref030">30</xref>]. Decreasing G9a levels in dilp2-expressing neurons also resulted in reduced OS resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In contrast, panneuronal knockdown using <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> did not have an effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), possibly because <italic>elav</italic>-driven Gal4 is not as strongly expressed as <italic>dilp2</italic>-driven Gal4 in dilp2-expressing neurons. Taken together, the data suggest that G9a safeguards energy homeostasis during OS in tissues with a known role in mediating organismal energy homeostasis.</p>

<title>Energy availability is a key determinant of OS resistance</title>
<p>Finally, we asked whether energy could be a limiting factor for survival in our paraquat-induced OS regime and whether abnormal energy consumption in G9a mutants underlies their premature death in response to OS. We addressed these questions by manipulation of glucose availability in G9a mutant and control animals.</p>
<p>First, we provided a high dose of glucose as an immediately accessible energy source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This high-sugar diet restored survival of G9a mutants to control levels (G9a null versus G9a null high sugar, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; controls versus G9a null high sugar, <italic>p</italic> = 0.885) while also extending the survival of controls (controls versus controls high sugar, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). In contrast, when flies were provided a high-protein diet, no improvement of survival in G9a mutants or controls was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Improved OS resistance in response to a high-sugar diet in G9a mutants and controls suggests that energy availability is generally a limiting factor in OS resistance. To directly address if limiting energy availability affects OS resistance, we determined survival of flies with ubiquitous knockdown of glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP), the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown into glucose. Ubiquitous GlyP RNAi knockdown resulted in a 66% reduction in <italic>GlyP</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) and caused partial lethality. The surviving GlyP-knockdown adults recapitulated the reduced OS tolerance of G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Taken together, these data show that access to energy stores is a limiting factor in resistance to OS exposure. G9a mutants, which are characterized by a perturbed metabolic response to OS resulting in a net reduction of available energy, show reduced OS resistance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that G9a mutants show reduced survival upon OS exposure and investigated the underlying transcriptional and physiological mechanisms. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the largest group of DE genes are highly augmented upon OS induction in the G9a mutant (41.7% of all DE genes, Group 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The second largest group of DE genes (23.9% of all DE genes, Group 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) were more down-regulated in G9a mutants in response to OS. Genes that are overactivated in G9a mutants are predominantly involved in OS response and OS-mediated damage, whereas genes that are down-regulated in G9a mutants are involved in energy metabolism.</p>
<p>Analyses of OS markers revealed that G9a mutants were able to cope with the OS challenge, since ROS levels and OS-mediated damage were not increased in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g004">Fig 4</xref>), and antioxidant supplementation did not rescue G9a mutant survival during OS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Instead, G9a mutants showed abnormal energy use during OS exposure that was characterized by a rapid depletion of glycogen stores and by a failure to mobilize triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Death of the mutant population coincided with exhausted glycogen stores and was rescued effectively by supplying an immediately available energy source, glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Moreover, we found that energy stores also declined in control animals in response to the applied OS regime and that survival of controls also improved upon glucose supplementation, suggesting that energy availability in general is a limiting factor in OS resistance. In support of this, we demonstrated that directly limiting access to glycogen stores through knockdown of GlyP, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen mobilization, also causes OS sensitivity. Together, our data suggest that G9a safeguards appropriate transcriptional and metabolic responses to OS to ensure that optimal energy recourses are available to fuel the stress response.</p>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Mechanistic basis of OS susceptibility in G9a mutants</title>
<p>We propose that three mechanisms may contribute to increased OS susceptibility in G9a mutants: (1) inaccessible fat stores, (2) inefficient use and thus accelerated wasting of glycogen, and (3) an overactivated transcriptional response to OS that will consume additional energy.</p>
<p>At steady state, expression of the lipid phosphatases <italic>CG11437</italic> and <italic>CG11438</italic>, which are important for triglyceride synthesis, are up-regulated in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s004">S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7</xref> Figs). Furthermore, expression of <italic>heimdall</italic> and <italic>bubblegum</italic>, two important enzymes in charge of breaking down triglyceride long-chain fatty acids, are down-regulated in G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s004">S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s007">S7</xref> Figs). These findings may account for the identified high triglyceride stores and increased abundance and size of fat body lipid droplets in G9a mutants at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). <italic>Heimdall</italic> and <italic>bubblegum</italic> expression levels remain low in G9a mutants during OS exposure, whereas in controls <italic>heimdall</italic> is strongly induced, which could explain the defect in lipid mobilization during the OS response. Three transcription factors are known to bind to both <italic>heimdall</italic> and <italic>bubblegum</italic> cis-regulatory elements (dorsal, kruppel, and medea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref031">31</xref>]), but none of them has been linked to G9a, and in general little is known about G9a’s sequence-specific cofactors.</p>
<p>Whereas triglycerides remain inaccessible in G9a mutants, we observed a rapid exhaustion of glycogen stores, suggesting that there is a high energy demand during the OS response. Depletion of glycogen stores during OS exposure has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref032">32</xref>]. Energy is needed for the rapid production and activity of ROS protective enzymes. In the absence of G9a, ROS protective enzymes are overactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Our data argue that this inappropriate scaling of the transcriptional response to OS causes an additional energy demand in G9a mutants that is exacerbated by their deficiency in triglyceride breakdown, resulting in early death due to lack of available energy. Some of the overactivated genes, such as <italic>GstE1</italic>, <italic>Prx2450-1</italic>, <italic>Cat</italic>, and <italic>Ldh</italic>, were previously identified as targets for G9a-mediated H3K9me2. This suggests that this epigenetic modification might serve to buffer stress-induced gene activation, as we have previously observed in the response to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref016">16</xref>]. However, these epigenetic differences were identified originally in whole larvae, and it remains to be seen if chromatin changes are also present in G9a mutant heads or in other specific tissues/cells that we identified to be important, such as the fat body or dilp2-expressing neurons.</p>
<p>Our data further indicate that G9a mutants may suffer from an OS-induced metabolic shift resulting in energy wasting, known as the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref033">33</xref>]. The rapid use of glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and the highly increased expression of <italic>Ldh</italic> in <italic>G9a</italic> mutants under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g005">Fig 5M</xref>) are consistent with this metabolic state that is often seen in tumors, in which all energy is derived from glycolysis rather than from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, despite the presence of oxygen. Under these conditions the main product of glycolysis, pyruvate, is converted to lactate by Ldh, a process that produces energy quickly but less efficiently than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.</p>

<title>G9a functions as protective factor in various stress responses</title>
<p>Recently, it was suggested that G9a is required for optimal survival in response to starvation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref017">17</xref>]. An and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref017">17</xref>] proposed that the role of G9a is highly specific for this type of stress, as they were unable to detect susceptibility of G9a mutants to heat stress and observed no difference in survival time upon exposure to 10 mM paraquat when compared to controls. In contrast, we demonstrate the importance of G9a in the transcriptional and physiological response to OS and have previously provided evidence for G9a’s role in the response to virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, we have observed that G9a-deficient flies are sensitive to several stresses in addition to paraquat, including the alternative potent OS-inducing agent MSB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) and other stressors such as heat stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s010">S10A Fig</xref>) and cold shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). Our observations are supported by several recent cell culture studies indicating the importance of G9a in hypoxia resistance during the rapid proliferation of cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, in contrast to previous conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref017">17</xref>], it appears that <italic>Drosophila</italic> G9a has a protective function in response to multiple different types of stress. Another recent study has shown that G9a mutants show increased resistance to starvation on agar media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref034">34</xref>], which is consistent with our own findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s010">S10C Fig</xref>) and makes sense in light of the increased steady-state energy stores. The inconsistencies with An and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref017">17</xref>] might arise from methodological differences that were employed by the authors, such as the use of high temperature (29°C) in combination with using filter paper during starvation assays, as opposed to agar media. It is conceivable that these conditions might result in confounding factors such as dehydration.</p>
<p>Here, we report reduced survival of two G9a-null mutants and G9a RNAi-mediated knockdown flies upon exposure to 50 mM paraquat, which induces lethality within 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g001">Fig 1</xref>). An and colleagues concluded that G9a is not important for OS resistance. Their applied level of OS using 10 mM paraquat appears to be mild, as flies survived for up to 20 d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref017">17</xref>]. This may suggest that G9a is particularly essential to defeat high levels of OS, which may be supported by our observation that G9a was not required for OS resistance when exposed to 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006146.s010">S10D Fig</xref>), a milder OS agent than paraquat. It is also compatible with our finding that G9a mutants are well able to combat ROS and oxidative damage, even under high OS as tested in our study, and that decreased OS resistance results from energy shortage. An and colleagues also observe that G9a mutants have a higher level of glycogen in steady-state conditions, which is rapidly depleted in response to starvation. They did not observe increased triglycerides in G9a mutant flies, nor did they observe an inability to access these stores in response to starvation, findings for which we provided evidence both in histology as well as in metabolite assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006146.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Although the discrepancy at steady state may relate to the different G9a mutant that they have utilized, triglyceride usage in G9a mutants may also be specific to the type of stress. Taken together, these studies suggest that G9a is involved in a complex metabolic response to multiple types of environmental stress.</p>

<p>Recent studies have shown that G9a dampens expression of target genes regulating hypoxia, tumor suppression, autophagy, and angiogenesis, making it an attractive target to interfere with cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref015">15</xref>]. Of note, mutations in the <italic>G9a</italic> orthologue <italic>EHMT1</italic> in humans cause Kleefstra syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by intellectual disability and autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref035">35</xref>] and that also shows neurodegenerative features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref036">36</xref>]. Whether the disorder is characterized by increased cancer resistance and/or metabolic defects is unknown, but increased frequency of obesity has been reported as a feature of Kleefstra syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref038">38</xref>]. Combined loss of <italic>Drosophila heimdall</italic> and <italic>bubblegum</italic>, the two key enzymes of triglyceride long-chain fatty acid breakdown that we found to be highly down-regulated in G9a mutants, causes neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref039">39</xref>], raising the possibility that equivalent metabolic mechanisms could underlie neurodegenerative features of Kleefstra syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref036">36</xref>]. Our data propose metabolic dysregulation as a novel hypothesis about the mechanisms underlying physiological and pathological aspects of Kleefstra syndrome, meriting novel lines of clinical investigation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified a role for <italic>Drosophila</italic> G9a in the transcriptional and metabolic response to systemic OS exposure. These findings were obtained by feeding adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> a lethal dose of paraquat. Paraquat has been used as a herbicide in agriculture and adverse effects on health due to chronic exposure are well studied in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006146.ref040">40</xref>]. Although our experimental conditions do not mimic the environmental exposure in human populations, it has allowed us to identify the mechanistic role of G9a as a generally protective factor in the organismal response to environmental stress.</p>

<title>RNA-seq and data analysis</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from 200 fly heads per sample using QIAGEN lipid mini tissue kit. The TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) was used to prepare adapter ligated PCR fragments for sequencing. In brief, mRNA was purified from total RNA and fragmented. The cleaved mRNA was primed with random hexamers and reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA. The RNA template was then removed, and a replacement, complementary strand was generated. The ends of the double-stranded cDNA were repaired and adenylated. Then, sequencing adapters were ligated to the prepared cDNA. PCR was used to selectively enrich the fragments containing the adapters. The PCR fragments were validated using Agilent 2200 TapeStation. Single indexed samples were multiplexed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing system in single-end mode with a read length of 30 bp. Quality of sequenced reads was assessed with FastQC. The RNA-seq experiments were conducted on two biological duplicates for each condition.
