<p>This study reveals an important family of fungal regulatory proteins to be transcription factors that contain a DNA-binding “velvet” domain structurally related to that of mammalian NFkB.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Morphological development of fungi and their combined production of secondary metabolites are both acting in defence and protection. These processes are mainly coordinated by <italic>velvet</italic> regulators, which contain a yet functionally and structurally uncharacterized <italic>velvet</italic> domain. Here we demonstrate that the <italic>velvet</italic> domain of VosA is a novel DNA-binding motif that specifically recognizes an 11-nucleotide consensus sequence consisting of two motifs in the promoters of key developmental regulatory genes. The crystal structure analysis of the VosA <italic>velvet</italic> domain revealed an unforeseen structural similarity with the Rel homology domain (RHD) of the mammalian transcription factor NF-κB. Based on this structural similarity several conserved amino acid residues present in all <italic>velvet</italic> domains have been identified and shown to be essential for the DNA binding ability of VosA. The <italic>velvet</italic> domain is also involved in dimer formation as seen in the solved crystal structures of the VosA homodimer and the VosA-VelB heterodimer. These findings suggest that defence mechanisms of both fungi and animals might be governed by structurally related DNA-binding transcription factors.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In many fungi, developmental processes and the synthesis of nonessential chemicals (secondary metabolites) are regulated by various external stimuli, such as light. Although fungi employ them for defensive purposes, secondary metabolites range from useful antibiotics to powerful toxins, so understanding the molecular processes that regulate their synthesis is of particular interest to us. In the mold <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> the main regulators of these processes are the so-called “<italic>velvet</italic>” proteins VeA, VelB, and VosA, which share a 150-amino acid region known as the <italic>velvet</italic> domain. <italic>Velvet</italic> proteins interact with each other, alone (“homodimers”), in various combinations (“heterodimers”), and also with other proteins, but the molecular mechanism by which these proteins exert their regulatory function has been unclear. In this work we show that <italic>velvet</italic> proteins form a family of fungus-specific transcription factors that directly bind to target DNA, even though analysis of their amino acid sequence does not reveal any known DNA-binding domains or motifs. We determined the three-dimensional structure of the VosA-VosA homodimer and the VosA-VelB heterodimer and found that the structure of the <italic>velvet</italic> domain is strongly reminiscent of the N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain found in the mammalian transcription factor NFκB-p50, despite the very low sequence similarity. We propose that, like NFκB, various homo- or heterodimers of <italic>velvet</italic> proteins modulate gene expression to drive development and defensive pathways in fungi.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fungal and the animal kingdom are related as they both belong to the ophistokonts with a common ancestor existing about 1 billion years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Baldauf1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Wainright1">[2]</xref>. Animals have evolved with an elaborate inflammation and immune system for self-defence. Inflammation, the immune system, and animal development are controlled by various mono- and multiprotein assemblies of RHD-containing proteins. Among others, one family, named NF-κB, consists of five members, which respond to external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-ODea1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Oeckinghaus1">[4]</xref>. In contrast to animals, fungi are normally secured by a thick cell wall and had been misclassified as plants for centuries due to their loss of motility and the establishment of a cell wall. In addition, in response to various abiotic or biotic signals, filamentous fungi produce small signalling and/or defensive bioactive molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Calvo1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Bayram1">[6]</xref>. These secondary metabolites range from antibiotics such as penicillins to mycotoxins such as aflatoxins, affecting everyday life of animals and human beings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Yu1">[7]</xref>. Regulation of the secondary metabolism as well as the control of growth and differentiation of the model mold <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> are coupled by a family of fungal regulators, the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Bayram1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Park1">[8]</xref>. These <italic>velvet</italic> regulators are present in most parts of the fungal kingdom from chytrids to basidiomycetes. The <italic>velvet</italic> proteins share a homologous region comprising about 150 amino acids, which lack significant sequence homology to any other known proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>A. nidulans</italic> the four <italic>velvet</italic> proteins VeA, VelB, VelC, and VosA have been identified and characterized. They can interact with each other and also with non-<italic>velvet</italic> proteins resulting in complexes, which link morphological and chemical development of fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Bayram2">[9]</xref>. The regulation of sexual development and secondary metabolism has been shown to be a light-regulated process coordinated by the heterotrimeric complex, consisting of the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins VeA, the VeA-like protein B (VelB), and the putative methyltransferase LaeA. The heterotrimeric VelB/VeA/LaeA-complex activates secondary metabolism and sexual development. The Δ<italic>laeA</italic> and Δ<italic>veA</italic> mutant strains are unable to produce hardly any sterigmatocystin, the penultimate precursor of aflatoxins. Similarly Δ<italic>veA</italic> and Δ<italic>velB</italic> strains do not form any sexual fruiting body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Bayram2">[9]</xref>. Notably, in the dark VeA is predominantly found in the nucleus, whereas it is mostly in the cytoplasm in the light. VeA contains an N-terminally located nuclear localisation signal (NLS) recognized by the nuclear import factor KapA mediating the transport from the cytoplasm into the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Stinnett1">[10]</xref>, once it becomes accessible by a yet unknown factor or mechanism.</p>
<p>VosA contains an N-terminally located <italic>velvet</italic> domain and is required for the transcription of several genes essential for spore viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Ni1">[11]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>vosA</italic> results in a severe down-regulation of genes associated with trehalose biosynthesis (<italic>tpsA</italic>, <italic>tpsC</italic>, and <italic>orlA</italic>) and the lack of trehalose biogenesis in spores. As a consequence, spores of Δ<italic>vosA</italic> strains are much less resistant to heat, UV, and other stress conditions and exhibit a strongly reduced survival rate after 10 d. Studies of spore viability of the Δ<italic>velB</italic> mutant revealed that the interaction of VosA with VelB is required for proper expression of the trehalose biosynthesis genes in fungal spores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-SarikayaBayram1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Park2">[13]</xref>. Similar to the Δ<italic>vosA</italic> strain, the Δ<italic>velB</italic> strain produces spores that contain virtually no trehalose, rendering them much more susceptible to desiccation and other stresses.</p>
<p>The role of <italic>velvet</italic> proteins in other fungi has been extensively studied in the past few years. While external stimuli can be different, their regulatory function on secondary metabolism and development seems to be conserved. In the human pathogen <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, the switch from filamentous growth to the pathogenic yeast form is triggered by a temperature increase and requires the VosA and VelB orthologues Ryp2 and Ryp3, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Webster1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-LaskowskiPeak1">[15]</xref>. In <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic>, the deletion of the <italic>veA</italic> and <italic>velB</italic> homologues <italic>Ffvel1</italic> and <italic>Ffvel2</italic> affects the secondary metabolism and virulence on rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Wiemann1">[16]</xref>. In several cases the <italic>veA</italic> null mutation could be rescued by complementation of cross-genus <italic>veA</italic> from other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Wiemann1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Park3">[18]</xref>. Numerous recent studies support a role of <italic>velvet</italic> proteins in fungal virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Yang1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Dhingra1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we report the molecular basis of the <italic>velvet</italic>-mediated gene regulation. Genome-wide and targeted DNA binding studies of VosA reveal that its <italic>velvet</italic> domain recognizes an 11-nucleotide sequence present in the promoter regions of many regulatory and structural genes. The crystal structure analysis of the <italic>velvet</italic> domains of VosA and the heterodimeric VosA-VelB complex demonstrate that the <italic>velvet</italic> domain is an RHD-like domain related to NF-κB. Besides the <italic>velvet</italic> domain, VosA contains a predicted C-terminal transcriptional activation domain, implying that it is likely a transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Ni1">[11]</xref>. Taken together, the existence of novel fungus-specific transcription factors possessing a mammalian NF-κB–like DNA-binding domain suggests a common functional origin for the coordination of fungal development with secondary metabolism and the immuno-inflammatory response control in humans.</p>

<title>VosA Is a DNA-Binding Protein</title>
<p>Due to their regulatory roles and nuclear localization, a function as transcription factor was proposed for <italic>velvet</italic> proteins. However, based on their amino acid sequences, no known DNA-binding domain could be identified. To test for a potential DNA binding activity of <italic>velvet</italic> proteins, <italic>in vivo</italic> chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) employing the VosA protein tagged with FLAG followed by <italic>A. nidulans</italic> tiling microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) was carried out. The results revealed that more than 1,500 genes' promoters were enriched by the VosA-FLAG-ChIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s016">Table S1</xref>). For verification of these results, we further carried out ChIP-PCR and demonstrated that VosA-FLAG-ChIP indeed specifically enriched the promoter regions of the genes associated with asexual development (<italic>brlA</italic>, <italic>wetA</italic>, and <italic>vosA</italic>) and trehalose biosynthesis (<italic>tpsA</italic> and <italic>treA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Using VosA-ChIP-chip result, we then performed the consensus motif analysis, which led to several motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s017">Table S2</xref>). Independent of this computer-based analysis, we carried out a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with full-length or truncated VosA proteins (VosA, VosA_N, VosA_C) using various regions of the <italic>brlA</italic> promoter as probes. Such a promoter-walking EMSA revealed that full-length and the N-terminal half of VosA (VosA_N, residues 1–216) containing the entire <italic>velvet</italic> homology region binds to a 35 bp fragment of the <italic>brlA</italic>β promoter (−1,395 to −1,361, marked by the arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To develop a preliminary motif recognized by VosA, we used 14 sequences from ChIP-chip and Northern blot results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s018">Table S3</xref>) and one 35 bp <italic>brlA</italic>β fragment from EMSA. These 15 sequences were subject to MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Bailey1">[23]</xref> and an 11-nucleotide consensus sequence was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This motif (positions 5 through 10) is similar to motif 1 from ChIP-chip results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s017">Table S2</xref>) and has a very good palindrome structure (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCGCGG</named-content>). In addition, the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGG</named-content> sequence (positions 2 to 4 in a preliminary motif sequence) is included in three motifs from ChIP-chip results. To test whether these sequences (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCGCGG</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGG</named-content>) in the 35 bp <italic>brlA</italic>β fragment are core sequences that are needed for DNA-binding, we designed three probes that specifically deleted these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). VosA-DNA binding was decreased when the mutated probes were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggested that the VosA <italic>velvet</italic> domain represents a novel type of DNA-binding domain that recognizes an 11-nucleotide DNA sequence.</p>

<p>Previous studies proposed that the VelB-VosA heterodimer is a functional unit of trehalose biosynthesis in spores and of spore maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-SarikayaBayram1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Park2">[13]</xref>. To test whether VelB-ChIP also enriches the promoter regions of the VosA target genes, a VelB-ChIP-PCR analysis was performed. VelB-FLAG-ChIP enriched the same promoter, but not ORF-regions of VosA target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s003">S3</xref>). To test the molecular consequences of the lack of VosA or VelB in spores, we then examined the mRNA levels of the high score genes in wild-type, Δ<italic>vosA</italic>, and Δ<italic>velB</italic> strain conidia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s018">Table S3</xref>). Deletion of <italic>velB</italic>, similar to deletion of <italic>vosA</italic>, caused reduced accumulation of AN8694, <italic>nsdD</italic>, AN5371, <italic>cteA</italic>, AN6508, and AN5709 mRNAs, but increased transcript levels of <italic>brlA</italic>, <italic>treA</italic> AN8741, and <italic>rfeG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that these two <italic>velvet</italic> regulators play a dual role in activating genes associated with spore maturation and repressing certain development-associated genes. As mentioned above, the <italic>velvet</italic> domain of VosA is a DNA-binding domain. To test the DNA binding ability of the <italic>velvet</italic> domains of other <italic>velvet</italic> proteins, we carried out further EMSAs using VeA, VelB, or a heterodimer composed of VelB and the minimal <italic>velvet</italic> domain of VosA encompassing amino acid residues 1–190 (VosA<sub>1–190</sub>), which was designed for crystallization (see below). The VelB protein alone failed to bind to the <italic>brlA</italic> probe, whereas VosA<sub>1–190</sub>-VelB and VeA bind to this probe readily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s004">S4</xref>). In addition, VosA<sub>1–190</sub>-VelB and VeA binding to DNA was decreased when the mutated probes of the <italic>brlA</italic>-promoter region were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Overall, these results imply that the homodimers of VosA and VeA may recognize the same promoter regions, while VelB alone at least does not bind the <italic>brlA</italic> promoter. However, binding sequences and affinities might be different for heterodimers.</p>

<title>Crystal Structure of the Velvet Domain Reveals a NF-κB–Like Fold</title>
<p>In order to gain insights into the structural basis of the specific DNA recognition and to increase the chances for crystallization, a minimal <italic>velvet</italic> domain of VosA encompassing residues 1–190 (VosA<sub>1–190</sub>) was cloned, expressed, and purified. The DNA binding properties—albeit weaker than for the VosA_N—indicated a properly folded and active entity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which crystallized readily forming well-diffracting tetragonal crystals. The crystal structure of VosA<sub>1–190</sub> was determined <italic>de novo</italic> by means of single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). The structure was refined at a resolution of 1.79 Å (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001750-t001">Table 1</xref>) and comprises residues 8–185 belonging to one VosA monomer occupying the asymmetric unit. Crystal packing analysis revealed the existence of a homodimer defined by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis, which is consistent with the results from size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle-light-scattering (MALS), demonstrating that VosA<sub>1–190</sub> exists in solution as a homodimer (Figures S6 and S7).</p>

<p>The VosA <italic>velvet</italic>-domain folds into a highly twisted β-sandwich containing seven antiparallel β-strands. One side of the β-sandwich is involved in dimer formation, whereas the other one is flanked by several loops of which two fold into an α-helix. These α-helical fragments are located between β-strands 2 and 3 and at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The 2-fold symmetry of a homodimer results in an antiparallel orientation of β-strands 2, 3, 5, and 7 to the same strands of the other subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The surface area covered by the interaction of the subunits is 1,078 Å<sup>2</sup> corresponding to 12.7% of the total molecule surface sufficient for a stable interaction required for dimer formation. Both subunits contribute to a positively charged patch on the homodimer's surface likely to be involved in binding and recognition of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>A search for proteins structurally homologous to VosA using DALI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Holm1">[24]</xref> identified the mammalian transcription factor NF-κB-p50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Mller1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Ghosh1">[26]</xref> as the most similar protein structure with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.8 Å for 113 common C<sub>α</sub>-atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Given the low amino acid sequence identity of 13.7%, this structural similarity was quite unexpected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s008">Figure S8</xref>). NF-κB itself belongs to the family of Rel-proteins containing the conserved Rel-homology-region, which encompasses 300 residues that fold into two immunoglobulin-like domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Mller1">[25]</xref>,. Both of these domains are involved in DNA-binding, but dimerization of Rel-proteins is exclusively mediated by the C-terminally localized, shorter domain (Rel-C). Opposing, the fold of the VosA <italic>velvet</italic> domain resembles that of the longer N-terminal domain of NF-κB-p50 (Rel-N). The major difference between p50-Rel-N and the <italic>velvet</italic> domain is an insertion of three additional α-helices between β-strands 7 and 8 of p50-Rel-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s008">S8</xref>). A C-terminal helix that covers the β-sheet in the region formed by β1, β2, β5, and β4 of VosA is missing in p50-Rel-N. Instead p50-Rel-C interacts with a long loop connecting β1 and β2, extending the protein on that side.</p>
<p>The crystallized VosA fragment comprises the 190 N-terminal residues corresponding to the <italic>velvet</italic> domain. An amino acid sequence analysis of the missing C-terminal part of VosA performed with HHpred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Soding1">[27]</xref> revealed a homology to the Sec24 transport protein for a fragment comprising residues 240 to 434 of VosA (sequence identity and similarity of 23% and 35%, respectively). This C-terminally located domain is connected via a 50-residue-long region without any detectable structural homology, which nevertheless could correspond to the C-terminally located Rel-C domain of NF-κB-p50. Superposition of VosA and NF-κB-p50 structures revealed that the flexible loop connecting two domains in NF-κB-p50 could be structurally equivalent to a loop preceding the C-terminal helix (K160-M165) in VosA. The interpretation of the experimental electron density map of that loop was not unambiguous, as it is located close to crystallographic 2-fold axis. Hence the two possible conformations of that loop affect the positioning of the remaining C-terminal fragment that can either cover the β-sheet of the same protein molecule or the β-sheet of the adjacent protein molecule related by the 2-fold symmetry by employing a domain swapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<title>VosA Residues Involved in DNA-Binding</title>
<p>Utilizing the structural similarity to NF-κB, the mode of DNA binding of the <italic>velvet</italic> domain may be deduced from the superposition of the VosA monomer to crystal structures of NF-κB-DNA complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Mller1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Ghosh1">[26]</xref>—for example, the NF-κB p50 homodimer bound to DNA (PDB ID code 1SVC). The superposition reveals that the loop connecting the first and second β-strand (loop A) as well as the loop located before the C-terminal helix of VosA (loop B) could be involved in DNA binding by interactions with the major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Indeed, several positively charged residues (Lys, Arg) prone for DNA-binding activity are located within these loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). To test whether these residues are critical for DNA-binding, K37, K39, R41, and K42 located in loop A and K160 in loop B were individually substituted with alanine. The DNA binding activity of the mutated VosA<sub>1–190</sub> proteins was tested by an EMSA with the 35 bp fragment of the <italic>brlA</italic>β promoter containing the VosA binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and additionally with the same <italic>brlA</italic>β promoter fragment with deleted VosA binding motifs 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s010">Figure S10</xref>), verifying the importance of both motifs in VosA-DNA interaction. Remarkably, severely reduced DNA-binding activity was observed for all mutants located in loop A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, the loop B K160A mutant retained its DNA-binding capability. This observation suggests a minor, if any, involvement of the second loop in DNA binding and supports its assignment as a flexible loop joining two individual VosA domains. Substituting all four positively charged residues in this loop—namely K37, K39, R41 and K42—simultaneously with alanine completely abolished DNA binding activity. Similar to this quadruple mutant, already the double mutant K37A/K39A cannot bind to DNA anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This strongly indicates that this loop of VosA is involved in protein–DNA interactions, which is consistent with structural superposition with the NF-κB-DNA complex (PDB ID code 1SVC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The function of the double mutated protein K37/39A was also analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. The introduction of the mutated version of the <italic>vosA</italic> gene in a <italic>vosA</italic> deletion strain only partially complemented the <italic>vosA</italic> deletion phenotype, suggesting that the mutated protein is not working properly due to its reduced DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s011">Figure S11</xref>).</p>

This insertion is rich in proline, glutamine, glycine, tyrosine, and serine residues, and it is predicted to form an intrinsically disordered region. Even though full-length VelB (369 residues) was used for complex formation and crystallization, the insertion is not present in the crystal structure most likely due to a proteolytic removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s013">Figure S13</xref>). This proteolytic activity might also be the reason why residues 161–190 of VosA in this heterodimer structure are not defined in the electron density map, even though residues 161–185 are defined in the structure of the VosA homodimer. Overall VosA exhibits an almost identical fold as in the homodimer structure with an r.m.s.d. of 0.80 Å. The VelB <italic>velvet</italic> domain adopts a fold similar to that of VosA (r.m.s.d. of 1.01 Å for 136 Cα positions), however it contains one additional N-terminal β-strand.</p>
<p>In the heterodimer, VosA and VelB share the same interaction surface with respect to the secondary structure elements involved in the interaction as the monomers of the VosA homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The surface covered by the interaction of both molecules (1,453 Å<sup>2</sup>) is slightly larger than that in the VosA homodimer (1,078 Å<sup>2</sup>). A major difference to the VosA homodimer is that the VelB protein in the VosA-VelB heterodimer is oriented differently. With respect to the second VosA-molecule, in the homodimer it is rotated by around 30° and shifted about 3 Å closer toward VosA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s014">Figure S14</xref>). Importantly, the lack of the 99-residue-long insertion in the VelB <italic>velvet</italic> domain does not compromise the binding of VelB to VosA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>Superposition of VelB with VosA reveals that DNA-binding loops A and B in VelB differ in arrangement and/or sequence from VosA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s012">Figure S12</xref>). Loop B, which is highly similar in the overall structure to VosA, contains two lysines instead of one, both pointing away from the protein molecule. In both VosA and VelB, loop A is made up of eight residues. While loop A of VelB has an irregular conformation, the corresponding loop A of VosA contains a short helical element resulting in an elongated loop. The lysines in loop A of VosA play an important role in DNA binding, however there is only one lysine in loop A of VelB present and K42 is exchanged into R81. Interestingly, R80 (corresponding to R41 in VosA) is not pointing inward as in the VosA homodimer, but is oriented outward and interacts with a sulfate ion and the neighbouring D77 side chain and D79 carbonyl group. Flexibility of the loop regions comprising the positively charged residues might be a prerequisite for these interactions to contribute to both DNA binding and subsequent stabilization of the loop conformation of VelB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s012">Figure S12</xref>).</p>
<p>All together the differences in the DNA-binding loops are indicative for a different interaction surface, which in turn could cause different DNA sequence specificity of VosA and VelB, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Members of the <italic>velvet</italic> protein family have been defined by a conserved sequence comprising some 150 amino acids, denoted as <italic>velvet</italic> domain. Only in VelB the <italic>velvet</italic> domain contains an insertion of 99 residues of yet unknown function. The crystal structure analysis of VosA and VelB revealed that the <italic>velvet</italic> domain represents a structural entity. The <italic>velvet</italic> domain is involved in specific DNA binding as well as in the dimerization of the different <italic>velvet</italic> proteins, resulting in formation of homo- and heterodimers.</p>
<p>The common fold of the VosA and VelB <italic>velvet</italic>-domain comprises a highly twisted β-sandwich composed of seven antiparallel β-strands, an α-helix inserted in the loop connecting β-strands 2 and 3, and a second, C-terminally located α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g005">5</xref>). VosA forms a homodimer, as indicated by an interaction surface encompassing 12.7% of the total surface. This is supported by results from gel-filtration and MALS experiments. Head-to-head homodimer formation buries equivalent outside surfaces formed by strands β4, β3, β6, β7 of each VosA monomer resulting in formation of an intradimer eight-stranded β-sandwich. The newly formed β-sandwich buries several hydrophobic residues located on β3, β6, and β7, in particular three Phe (F72, F136, and F145), positioned in a row perpendicular to β-sandwich axis. Thus a cluster of six Phe forming a large hydrophobic patch could be the major driving force for VosA oligomerization. Interestingly, although using the identical region for interaction in the VosA-VelB heterodimer, the complexes significantly differ in relative orientation of individual monomers. This is mostly due to different length and curvature of the β6 and β7 and interconnecting loop found in VelB β-sandwich, which in order to pack against a β-sandwich of VosA needs to be rotated by 32° and shifted by 3 Å. This results in a better fit of the two subunits and increase of the interaction surface, which similarly to the VosA homodimer buries several hydrophobic side chains in the core of newly formed intradimer eight-stranded β-sandwich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Both proteins reveal a structural similarity to members of the NF-κB-p50-family, especially to a conserved region of about 150 amino acids that resembles an RHD-like fold. In contrast to NF-κB, where the C-terminal domain is responsible for the dimerization and both domains are capable of binding to DNA, the <italic>velvet</italic> domain harbours both functions. Based on the obtained structural information of VosA and VelB and their specific DNA binding properties (discussed below), we propose that the fungal <italic>velvet</italic> proteins represent a new class of direct DNA-binding transcription factors sharing a common ancestor(s) with the NF-κB-p50 family.</p>
<p>Comparison of VosA and VelB overall structure with NF-κB allowed identification of critical residues for DNA-binding activity located in a loop region within a patch of positively charged surface. According to the superposition, binding would occur to the major groove of the DNA. Substitution of these residues with alanine in VosA clearly abolishes DNA-binding activity. The strongest effect on DNA-binding is observed by replacing K37/K39, suggesting that these two residues together with K42 provide the major interactions with the DNA. The introduction of a mutated <italic>vosA</italic> K37/39A in the genome of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> proves that these two residues are important for proper function of the protein. The deletion of <italic>vosA</italic> results in an up-regulation of the <italic>brlA</italic> gene and to a loss of viability after 10 d of growth due to the lack of trehalose. Additionally, the deletion influences the production of sexual spores and of pigments released to the agar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s011">Figure S11B</xref>). The introduction of the mutated <italic>vosA</italic> K37/39A allele in a Δ<italic>vosA</italic> strain fails to fully complement these defects. Only the production of sexual spores was restored, whereas the spore viability was partially restored, but the defected control of pigmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s011">Figure S11B</xref>) and <italic>brlA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s011">Figure S11C</xref>) was not rescued.</p>
<p>This patch of positively charged residues defined by K37, K39, and K42 is well conserved among all <italic>velvet</italic> proteins, suggesting a common mode of protein-DNA interaction for VosA and VelB. Furthermore, the structural comparison with NF-κB suggests that the VosA homodimer recognizes about 11 base-pairs, which is in agreement with the predicted 11 nucleotides consensus sequence recognized by VosA in our ChIP-chip analysis.</p>
<p>However, the arrangement of the VosA homodimer and the superposition and modelling of the DNA reveals that the putative DNA-binding loops of the second molecule is at least ∼13 Å distant to the backbone of a dsDNA with ideal B-form conformation. A simultaneous binding to both VosA molecules would require a kink in the DNA. In contrast to the VosA homodimer, in the putative VosA-VelB-DNA complex model with VosA in close proximity to the DNA, the distance of the <italic>velvet</italic> domain of VelB to the DNA backbone is reduced and would require less bending of an ideal B-form DNA for tight interaction. Both DNA sequence motifs 1 and 2 play an important role in DNA binding of VosA, however with differing importance. Deletion of motif 1 has a higher influence on binding efficiency than deletion of motif 2. A recent study demonstrated that the DNA-binding sequence of the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins Ryp2 and Ryp3 in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> is highly similar to the motif 1 derived from our ChIP-chip result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s017">Table S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Beyhan1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>The electron density obtained from the VosA<sub>1–190</sub> crystals allows an interpretation of two alternate conformations of its C-terminal helix. The missing C-terminal part of VosA might lead to an overall conformation of VosA similar to the one observed for NF-κB and could increase the effect of loop B on DNA binding. The additional residues present in VosA-N might therefore explain its increased DNA binding in comparison to VosA<sub>1–190</sub>.</p>
<p>In summary, we suggest that the modulation of gene transcription is achieved by the use of varying homo- and heterodimers as seen for VosA and VelB, potentially allowing the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins to specifically recognize different DNA sequences causing differential regulatory outcomes. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic> there are four <italic>velvet</italic> proteins, three of which have been studied. VosA-VelB is essential for the regulation of asexual development and spore viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Ni1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Park2">[13]</xref> and VelB-VeA for sexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Ni1">[11]</xref>. The trimeric VelB-VeA-LaeA complex coordinates differentiation and secondary metabolism in response to external signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Bayram2">[9]</xref>. Little is known about the function of the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins in other clades of fungi outside of the ascomycetes, where much remains to be discovered. Interestingly, the unicellular eukaryote <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic>, which is a symbiont in the haemolymph of the tropical freshwater snail <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>, carries a gene for both an NF-κB and a VosA-like protein, suggesting the coexistence of both in this organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Hertel1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several studies indicate that the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins are global regulators controlling a diverse set of processes ranging from toxin production and cell wall formation to the development of resting or sexual fruiting structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Bayram1">[6]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine what additional common themes and features exist between fungal growth and developmental control by the <italic>velvet</italic> protein family and the immune, inflammation, and differentiation response of animals by the NF-κB protein family. One candidate for a common denominator of RHD and <italic>velvets</italic>' functions is the COP9 signalosome, a conserved multiprotein complex controlling the life span of proteins. The COP9 signalosome is required for the control of NF-κB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Schweitzer1">[30]</xref> as well as the control of fungal development and secondary metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Braus1">[31]</xref>. Recently it has been shown that the physical interactions between the COP9 signalosome and an additional developmental regulator protein are conserved between humans and fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Christmann1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly to the NF-κB transcription factors, the founding member of the <italic>velvet</italic> protein family, VeA, resides in the cytoplasm but is prevented from nuclear import in the light by a yet unknown factor or mechanism. It is tempting to speculate that the light signal leads to a posttranscriptional modification—e.g. phosphorylation—of VeA, hindering the interaction with the nuclear import factor KapA. The control of nucleocytoplasmic transport by phosphorylation is known for various proteins like Hxk2, LASP-1, IPMK, and hTERT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Chung1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-FernandezGarcia1">[36]</xref>. Notably, the regulation on the level of nucleocytoplasmic transport applies also for NF-κB, as the NF-κB inhibitor Iκ-Bα binds to NF-κB, thereby masking the NLS of NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Latimer1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Huxford1">[39]</xref>. However, the similarity of the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins to NF-κB does not extend to this regulatory mechanism, since no Iκ-B homolog or functional homolog could be identified in fungi yet. Hence, the precise understanding of differences and similarities in the molecular mechanisms of the <italic>velvet</italic>/Rel family might help to control fungi, which not only cause increasing problems for human health and crop yield/quality, but also play a crucial role as environmental recyclers, fermenters, industrial producers, and agricultural aids.</p>

<p>The calculated Matthews coefficient of 1.59 Å<sup>3</sup> Da<sup>−1</sup> (corresponding to a solvent content of 22.9%) excluded the presence of both proteins, VosA and VelB, used for crystallization trials in the asymmetric unit. Assuming that the asymmetric unit comprises two protein molecules with the size of VosA<sub>1–190</sub>, the calculated Matthews coefficient value is 2.27 Å<sup>3</sup> Da<sup>−1</sup> (45.6% solvent content). At this step of structure solution, the assumption was made to look for two molecules using the available model of VosA<sub>1–190</sub> comprising 143 amino acids (Ser 17 to Asp 79 and Ala 86 to Met 165). As the two proteins (VosA and VelB) share about 42% amino acid identity, the VosA<sub>1–190</sub> model could also be used to search for the fragments of VelB in case a proteolytic digest had occurred prior to crystal formation. The molecular replacement search was carried out with PHASER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-McCoy1">[50]</xref> using data between 30 and 2.2 Å resolution.

Then, 1/20 volume of 2.5 M glycine solution was added to stop the cross-linking reaction. The conidia were collected by centrifugation and the conidia were washed with cold PBS for three times. About 1.5 ml FA lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) per 50 ml) was added before use. Silica beads (∼300 µl) were added into cross-linked cell lysates and the lysates were broken by a mini-bead beater for three cycles (1.5 min homogenization with 1.5 min sitting on ice). Subsequently the samples were sonicated for seven cycles (30 s on, 60 s off) with a sonifier equipped with a microtip at 70% amplitude and level 5 of output control. All steps were carried out on ice. The sonicated cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by a 2,000×g spin for 3 min five times. The supernatant was collected, and its DNA concentration was checked using a biophotometer (Eppendorf). About 25 µl supernatant was kept as input chromatin control (glycerol was added to 10% final concentration if samples had to be frozen). The rest of supernatant was adjusted to 10 ml with FA lysis buffer, and 50 µl of Anti-Flag M2-agarose from mouse (SigmaAldrich) was added for ChIP with constant mixing overnight at 4°C. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with FA lysis buffer three times. About 50 µl elution buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) was added to the beads, and the sample incubated at 65°C for 10 min to elute chromatin samples from the beads. Both the recovered supernatant from the elution and the input chromatin supernatant (saved before ChIP) were adjusted to 170 µl by elution buffer, and incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse the crosslinking reaction. Then, the samples were treated by protease K for 2 h at 37°C, and protein extracted twice with phenol (equilibrated with TE, pH 8.0) and once with chloroform∶isoamyl alcohol (24∶1). DNA was precipitated by ethanol and resuspended in 30 µl RNase TE (to digest RNA). Finally, the DNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 30 µl of the elution buffer provided with the kit. To obtain sufficient amounts of DNA for further labelling and hybridization, DNA was amplified using the WGA kit (Sigma, WGA2). DNA labelling and hybridization were performed by Roche Nimblegen. The DNA bound by the VosA-FLAG protein was labelled with Cy5, while the control DNA was labelled with Cy3. We used the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> whole-genome tiling-oligonucleotide array containing 65,536 oligonucleotides (50∼65 nucleotides at a 75-bp interval, Roche Nimblegen). The array data from hybridization of two independent immune-precipitation experiments for the VosA∶FLAG strain were used for analysis. The data were processed using NimbleScan (Roche Nimblegen). Briefly, NimbleScan detects peaks by searching four or more probes whose signals are above the specified cutoff values using a 500 bp sliding window. The ratio data were then randomized 20 times to calculate the probability for being “false positive.” Every peak is assigned with a false discovery rate (FDR) score based on the randomization. The lower the FDR score, the higher the possibility that the peak corresponds to a real binding site. When finalizing the candidates, we used the cutoff value “1” (log 2 ratio of experiment to control) as peak score and cutoff value “0.05” for FDR score. Then we found the overlapping candidates from two chips.</p>

<title>VosA Binding Motif Analysis</title>
<p>To define the DNA motif recognized by VosA, we employed two separate approaches. First, using the VosA-FLAG ChIP-on-chip results, sequences of 400 bp on the midpoint of about 1,500 enriched peaks from the two VosA-ChIP biological replicates were used as target sequences. As a background, 6 kbp sequences on about 6,000 promoter regions of genes without the VosA peaks were used (BIOINFORX Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The data were then analysed using HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/" xlink:type="simple">http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/</ext-link>). The predicted VosA binding motifs are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s017">Table S2</xref>. Second, the ChIP-on-chip data were imported into RINGO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Toedling1">[52]</xref>, an R/Bioconductor package, for the analysis of ChIP-chip readouts, including the quality assessment, normalization, smoothing, and peak calling. We normalized the probe intensities by variance-stabilizing normalization (VSN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Huber1">[53]</xref>. We only included the peaks that were consistent in two independent VosA-ChIP biological replicates. Then several sequences were selected according to maxLevel, the highest smoothed probe level in the enriched region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s018">Table S3</xref>). We then examined mRNA levels of these genes and found that 10 genes' mRNA levels are affected by VosA and/or VelB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally, VosA-ChIP enriched sequences from these 10 genes, four sequences from the known target genes <italic>wetA</italic>, <italic>tpsA</italic>, <italic>orlA</italic>, and <italic>treA</italic>, and the 35 bp <italic>brlAβ</italic> promoter fragment shown to be bound by VosA in EMSA were subject to MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elecitation) analysis, which led to the predicted VosA binding motif <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGGCCaaGGC</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001750-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>ChIP-PCR</title>
<p>ChIP-PCR analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with a minor modification using MAGnify Chromatin Immunoprecipitation System (Invitrogen). Two-day-old conidia (1×10<sup>9</sup>) of WT (FGSC4), Δ<italic>velB</italic> (THS16.1), and Δ<italic>vosA</italic> (THS15.1) strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001750-Park2">[13]</xref> were cross-linked with fresh 1% formaldehyde at RT for 15 min. Then, 1/20 volume of 2.5 M glycine solution was added to stop the cross-linking reaction. The conidia were washed and broken by a mini-bead beater for two cycles (1 min homogenization with 1 min sitting on ice). The cell lysates were sonicated for four cycles (30 s on, 60 s off) with a sonifier. The sonicated cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 13,000×g for 10 min. The diluted chromatin extracts were incubated with 2 µg of anti-FLAG antibody-Dynabeads complex for 2 h at 4°C and then washed three times with the IP buffer. The input control and chromatin sample were eluted from the beads at 55°C for 15 min with reverse crosslinking buffer with proteinase K. DNA was purified by DNA purification Magnetic Beads (Invitrogen). For amplification of precipitated DNA by PCR, the GO Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) was used. The primer sets used for PCR are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s019">Table S4</xref>. As negative controls, the chromatin extract being incubated with bead only (without anti-FLAG antibody) and the samples of FGSC 4 lacking FLAG-tagged VosA or VelB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001750.s003">Figure S3</xref>) were used. Individual input DNA samples before immune-precipitation (IP) were used as positive controls. Two biological replicates have provided essentially identical ChIP-PCR results. Signal intensities of PCR results obtained from ChIP assays were analyzed by the ImageJ software available online (National Institutes of Health; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).</p>

<p><bold>Schematic drawing of the roles of the </bold><bold><italic>velvet</italic></bold><bold> regulators in </bold><bold><italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic></bold><bold> development.</bold> The VelB protein is part of at least two <italic>velvet</italic> protein complexes. In darkness VosA-VelB inhibits asexual development and simultaneously VelB-VeA favours sexual development. The nuclear heterotrimeric complex consisting of the <italic>velvet</italic> proteins VeA-VelB and the non-<italic>velvet</italic> protein LaeA coordinates sexual development with production of the mycotoxin Sterigmatocystin. Light inhibits this process and favours the asexual program, as the nuclear bridging of VelB to LaeA by VeA is interrupted. VosA contains a NLS, whereas VeA supports the transport of VelB into the nucleus. VosA is also found in the nucleus of spores and the VosA-VelB heterodimer plays an additional important role for spore maturation and long-term viability by coupling spore formation and trehalose biogenesis in spores.</p>
