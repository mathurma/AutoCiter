<abstract>
<p>The nucleosome repeat length (NRL) is an integral chromatin property important for its biological functions. Recent experiments revealed several conflicting trends of the NRL dependence on the concentrations of histones and other architectural chromatin proteins, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, but a systematic theoretical description of NRL as a function of DNA sequence and epigenetic determinants is currently lacking. To address this problem, we have performed an integrative biophysical and bioinformatics analysis in species ranging from yeast to frog to mouse where NRL was studied as a function of various parameters. We show that in simple eukaryotes such as yeast, a lower limit for the NRL value exists, determined by internucleosome interactions and remodeler action. For higher eukaryotes, also the upper limit exists since NRL is an increasing but saturating function of the linker histone concentration. Counterintuitively, smaller H1 variants or non-histone architectural proteins can initiate larger effects on the NRL due to entropic reasons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different regimes of the NRL dependence on histone concentrations exist depending on whether DNA sequence-specific effects dominate over boundary effects or <italic>vice versa</italic>. We consider several classes of genomic regions with apparently different regimes of the NRL variation. As one extreme, our analysis reveals that the period of oscillations of the nucleosome density around bound RNA polymerase coincides with the period of oscillations of positioning sites of the corresponding DNA sequence. At another extreme, we show that although mouse major satellite repeats intrinsically encode well-defined nucleosome preferences, they have no unique nucleosome arrangement and can undergo a switch between two distinct types of nucleosome positioning.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The DNA molecule of a human or mouse can be up to two meters long, if stretched. However, it is stored inside the small volume of the nucleus in the living cell. DNA compaction is achieved at different hierarchical levels with the help of a number of architectural proteins. The elementary unit of compaction is the nucleosome, where DNA is wrapped around the protein octamer core. Each nucleosome contains about 147 DNA base pairs; the length of DNA between the neighboring nucleosomes varies from nearly zero to several hundred of base pairs. This variability determines the biological function of the underlying DNA, since some parts of the genome are less compact, and thus potentially actively transcribed, while others are more compact, and their transcription is limited. The DNA distances between neighboring nucleosomes depend on the interaction with many chromatin-associated proteins. The average distance between two neighboring nucleosomes change for different genomic locations and even for the same genomic region in different cell states of the same organism. Here we study these effects and provide their quantitative biophysical description using available experimental data in a number of organisms, ranging from yeast to frog to mouse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The elementary unit of DNA packaging in the eukaryotic cell is the nucleosome, which consists of ∼147 bp of DNA wrapped around the core histone octamer. The nucleosome is commonly associated with the linker histone H1, this complex being referred to as the chromatosome. In addition, a number of other non-histone architectural proteins present in quantities comparable to histones help to shape chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-vanHolde1">[1]</xref>. Since the discovery of the nucleosome as the basic unit of chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Olins1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kornberg1">[3]</xref>, it become apparent that nucleosomes sometimes form ordered arrays, and scientists were trying to understand the principles governing the regularity and fuzziness of nucleosome arrays <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Lohr1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Trifonov1">[6]</xref>, the question which is still far from being understood. In practice, the knowledge of nucleosome positions is required to estimate the accessibility of transcription factors (TFs) to their DNA binding sites, quantify 3D chromatin structure, and ultimately understand the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. For this purpose, 1D lattice descriptions with nucleosome positions characterized by a single genomic coordinate became very popular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Chereji1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Reynolds1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>An important chromatin property that determines its biological function is the so-called nucleosome repeat length (NRL), defined as the average distance between the centers of neighboring nucleosomes. NRL can be defined either as a genome-average value, or as an average for a smaller subset of genomic regions. Past studies going back to 1970s showed that, in general, NRL is different for different species and even for different cell types of the same organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-vanHolde1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Weintraub1">[26]</xref>. In addition, recent publications reported NRL variations for different genomic regions of the same cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Valouev1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif5">[28]</xref>. An important recent work that compared the NRL around yeast transcription start sites (TSSs) <italic>in vivo</italic> and that for the reconstituted chromatin on the same DNA sequences <italic>in vitro</italic>, has showed that ordered nucleosome positioning arises only in the presence of ATP and chromatin remodelers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, it was reported that the NRL determined around yeast TSSs is an invariant value universal for a given wild type yeast strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Celona1">[30]</xref>, although it can change when one of chromatin remodelers is missing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Hennig1">[31]</xref>. These findings are difficult to explain within a simplistic theory of a homogenous 1D lattice gas of nucleosomes, which predicts that NRL is a decreasing function of the nucleosome density on the DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Mobius2">[32]</xref>. In addition, large NRL changes have been determined experimentally in higher eukaryotes as a function of histone concentration, including “<italic>in vivo</italic> titration” experiments in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, where exogenous concentrations of H1 variants were varied in a controlled way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Oberg1">[33]</xref>, as well as experiments in the living mouse cells with knock out of certain H1 variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Woodcock1">[34]</xref>. In the latter case, a linear dependence of the NRL on the linker-to-core histone ratio was found, which is consistent with electrostatic models attributing NRL changes to the DNA charge neutralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Woodcock1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Blank1">[36]</xref>. There are many other abundant architectural chromatin proteins in addition to H1, such as, e.g. the high-mobility group (HMG)-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Nalabothula1">[37]</xref>, or DNA methyl-binding proteins, MeCP2, which are expressed at near core-histone levels in neurons and globally alter the chromatin state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Skene1">[38]</xref>. An interesting recent work has showed that genomic region-specific NRL differences in the Drosophila genome can be accounted for by the HMGD1 to H1 ratio in those regions. Both HMGD1 and H1 bind DNA electrostatically, but affect NRL in the opposite ways. Thus, specific cooperative interactions between architectural proteins and nucleosomes need to be taken into account on top of nonspecific electrostatic effects. In addition, NRL can change as a function of the 3D structure of the chromatin fiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Routh1">[39]</xref>, which indicates that long-range internucleosome interactions also need to be considered.</p>
<p>A biophysical theory quantitatively incorporating the interplay of the above mentioned effects together with the DNA sequence to predict local NRL changes is currently missing. In order to develop such a theory, we depart from the previous 1D lattice models for nucleosome positioning, and focus on the next levels of complexity to study the effects on the NRL of the chromatin fiber structure and contributions of binding of linker histones and non-histone architectural proteins, as well as the binding of sequence-specific TFs. We start with a systematic analysis of the parameter space of the updated lattice model and determine how NRL depends on the short- and long-range interactions between nucleosomes, DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome and the concentration of core and linker histones. In the following section we apply our model to explain the seemingly controversial published dependencies of NRL on the concentration of core and linker histones <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Oberg1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Woodcock1">[34]</xref>. Finally, we combine biophysical and bioinformatics analysis with our high-resolution nucleosome positioning data in mouse embryonic stem cells to show that while direct and indirect sequence-specific effects dominate at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, the NRL of the constitutive heterochromatin appears to be mostly determined by the chromatin context rather than the repetitive DNA sequence.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>Classical 1D lattice models for DNA-ligand binding go back to 1970s (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif6">[40]</xref>). Together with a related class of lattice models for the DNA helix-coil transition, these are the descendants of the famous Ising model of ferromagnetism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Ising1">[41]</xref>. A common theme of these models is that the DNA is considered as a lattice of units (base pairs, bps), which can be in different states (e.g. bound or not bound by a given protein type), and the state of a given lattice unit can affect the states of its neighbors. An important conclusion from these studies is that non-specific binding of a large ligand to DNA in the presence of boundaries (close to the ends of the DNA segment or close to some other obstacles) results in a non-random periodic oscillation of the ligand binding probability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Epstein1">[42]</xref>. In 1988, Kornberg and Stryer proposed that a similar effect accounts for regular oscillations of preferred nucleosome positions in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kornberg2">[43]</xref>. The model of Kornberg and Stryer assumed a “1D gas” of self-excluding histone octamers which can freely diffuse along the DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kornberg2">[43]</xref>. This model had only one input parameter, the nucleosome density. Later, it was generalized in the spirit of classical ligand-DNA binding models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-McGhee1">[44]</xref> to include basic thermodynamic parameters such as the histone octamer binding constant, the length of the nucleoprotein particle in units of DNA base pairs (bp), and the contact cooperativity parameter for the interaction between nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Nechipurenko1">[45]</xref>. Following bioinformatic studies based on high-throughput sequencing provided compelling arguments to introduce a discrete distribution of sizes of the linker DNA between nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Wang1">[17]</xref> and long-range nucleosome-nucleosome interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Lubliner1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Chereji2">[46]</xref>. Additionally, arguments have been put forward that the model should be modified to take into account that the nucleosome core particle is not a static structure and some plasticity and partial DNA unwrapping from the histone octamer core can allow and facilitate the binding of TFs to the nucleosome-associated DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Chou1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Cherstvy2">[50]</xref>. Correspondingly, generic lattice models were adapted to include nucleosome unwrapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif3">[16]</xref>, and DNA unwrapping, which was shown to be an essential feature required for an adequate analysis of the available experimental data on nucleosome positioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Chereji1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Mobius1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif3">[16]</xref>. We will start from the model that includes all the features mentioned above. On top of it, we will take into account nucleosome interactions with each other and with chromatin architectural proteins (H1, HMG1, etc).</p>
<p>The scheme of our generalized 1D lattice model for nucleosome arrangement is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In the framework of this model, genomic DNA is represented as a 1D lattice of units numbered by index <italic>n</italic>, each of which can be either bound by any of <italic>f</italic> protein species or remain unoccupied. Each protein type <italic>g</italic> is characterized by its size <italic>m</italic>(<italic>g</italic>) in terms of the number of DNA base pairs covered upon its binding, the concentration of free protein, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>g</italic>), and DNA sequence-specific binding constant, <italic>K</italic>(<italic>n</italic>, <italic>g</italic>). In principle, the histone octamer is treated as just one of the many possible types of DNA-binding protein complexes. The use of the binding constant for the histone octamer does not mean that the complex freely binds and unbinds at equilibrium. Indeed, it is known that the free thermal sliding of the histone octamer along the DNA is limited at physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Meersseman1">[51]</xref>, and most nucleosome repositioning events happen <italic>in vivo</italic> actively with the help of ATP-dependent remodelers and histone chaperones, which decrease energy barriers for nucleosome translocations and effectively help to equilibrate the system. Remodelers can have their context- and cell type-dependent rules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif4">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Lngst1">[52]</xref>, but since these rules are not well known in practice, we can assume that these rules are already taken into account in the experimentally measured cell type-specific nucleosome distributions. Thus, the “equilibration” to get such a nucleosome distribution is actually a non-equilibrium process. Still, one can treat it as a collective equilibrium in an ensemble of many identical cells or for many instances of the cell at different time points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif7">[53]</xref>.</p>

<title>Lattice models to calculate nucleosome/TF binding landscapes in chromatin.</title>
<p>A) All-or-none models require that a DNA region is either within a nucleosome or bound by a transcription factor. B) Advanced view on co-binding of a TF and histone octamer to the same DNA region (top), and the corresponding lattice model (bottom), which takes into account the possibility of partial nucleosome unwrapping. C) Taking into account linker histones requires the introduction of long-range interactions between DNA-bound proteins. D), E) The scheme of the method of NRL calculation. Firstly, the oscillations of the nucleosome density are plotted around the boundary of interest (for example, an end of the DNA segment would be appropriate as a boundary). Then the coordinates of the peaks from (D) are collected and fitted with a linear function. The slope of the line in (E) determines the NRL.</p>

<p>The nucleosome core particle (NCP) is characterized by a nominal size <italic>m</italic>(NCP) = 147 bp, but the model allows its unwrapping by <italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub> bp from each end, up to a total allowed unwrapping length of <italic>h</italic><sub>max</sub>≥<italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>+<italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>. The linker histone H1 (or any other architectural protein) is allowed to bind both the free DNA and the nucleosome. The model assumes, for mathematical simplicity, that the binding takes place at the DNA lattice units free from other proteins. The physical connectivity between the linker histone and nucleosome (and in general for other protein binders) is accounted for by the interaction potential <italic>w</italic>(<italic>L</italic>,<italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>), where <italic>L</italic> is the distance along the DNA between proteins <italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>. In the limiting case in the absence of protein-protein separation (<italic>L</italic> = 0), <italic>w</italic>(0,<italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>) has a meaning of a standard McGhee-von Hippel contact cooperativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-McGhee1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif8">[54]</xref>. Another limiting case of <italic>w</italic>(<italic>L</italic>&lt;<italic>V</italic>,<italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>) = 0 corresponds to the long-range anti-cooperativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Lando1">[55]</xref> (for a given protein pair, protein binding is prohibited within <italic>L</italic>&lt;<italic>V</italic> bp from another bound protein). In particular, since H1 interacts mostly with the nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhou1">[56]</xref>, this has to be reflected by a high value of the contact cooperativity parameter <italic>w</italic>(0,H1,NCP). An intermediate case <italic>w</italic> = <italic>f</italic>(<italic>L</italic>) has been considered elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif9">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>The lattice model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g001">Figure 1</xref> can be solved mathematically either using dynamic programming or the transfer matrix formalism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif6">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif7">[53]</xref>. Here we have performed the calculations of nucleosome binding maps using our software suite <italic>TFnuc</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif7">[53]</xref>, which is based on the dynamic programming algorithm developed in our previous publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif6">[40]</xref>. See Supplementary Materials for the details of the computational implementation. <italic>TFnuc</italic> takes as input concentrations of DNA and DNA-binding proteins and position weight matrices (PWMs) for all the TFs studied, as well as the thermodynamic parameters listed above, which define the properties of the interaction model. As the output, TFnuc calculates binding probabilities <italic>c</italic>(<italic>g, n</italic>) for each protein type <italic>g</italic> at a genomic position <italic>n</italic> taking into account the presence of all other proteins and nucleosomes. The NRL for a given genomic region can be then determined, following our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif5">[28]</xref>, from a linear fit of the nucleosome occupancy peak positions versus the corresponding peak numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g001">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p>

<title>1) Higher nucleosome density leads to shorter NRLs</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2A</xref> demonstrates that as the nucleosome density increases, NRL sharply decreases down to the minimum size defined by neighboring nucleosome-nucleosome interactions (see below).

Interestingly, the magnitude of the effect predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2A</xref> (∼10 bp NRL decrease corresponding to a ∼10% nucleosome density increase) is consistent with recent remodeler knockout experiments in <italic>S. pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Hennig1">[31]</xref>.</p>

The non-linearity arises due to the fact that not all nucleosomes adopt the state with the largest possible unwrapping; some nucleosomes in the ensemble stay completely intact, while some others have just a few base pairs unwrapped (due to the thermal distribution of NCP unwrapping lengths). More unwrapping requires more energy to break attractive histone-DNA contacts, which is only partially compensated by the favorable entropy increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif3">[16]</xref>.

<title>4) Non-core-histone protein intercalation between nucleosomes increases NRL</title>
<p>Now let us consider linker histones H1 (or their variants such as H5, or other chromatin proteins such as HMGN1), as schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. In the 1D lattice model, the linker histone is assumed not only to bind the nucleosome, but also to cover several free DNA lattice units between nucleosomes, depending on the size of this protein. A proper affinity of the linker protein (“linker”) to the nucleosome core particle (“NCP”) is introduced by the interaction potential <italic>w</italic>(<italic>L</italic>, linker, NCP). Effectively, linker proteins introduce additional nucleosome-nucleosome interactions (e.g. repulsive steric interactions and attractive electrostatic interactions). The results of our calculations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2E</xref> suggest that the effect of linker proteins is quite different from the effect of direct nucleosome-nucleosome interactions considered in panels 2C and 2D. The major difference is that the effect of linker proteins is concentration-dependent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2E</xref> shows that when the linker protein concentration is large, it has a significant effect of the NRL.

<title>5) Smaller linker proteins can introduce stronger effects on the NRL</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2F</xref> shows that the size of the linker histone (or other non-histone players nonspecifically binding the nucleosome and the DNA linker between nucleosomes) is quite important for its ability to alter the NRL. Counterintuitively, smaller proteins appear to be more effective in increasing the NRL due to larger configurational entropy of rearrangements of bound proteins along the DNA. The latter effect was obtained assuming that H1-DNA binding affinity does not depend on the H1 size, which is not necessarily the case if the electrostatics of DNA-histone binding prevails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Cherstvy1">[35]</xref>. The finding that smaller proteins can exert larger steric effect on the NRL is in line with <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA condensation experiments, which have established that although cationic ligands with higher charge are better DNA condensing agents, smaller cations have stronger DNA condensing propensity when ligands of the same charge are considered, such as e.g. linear flexible polyamines and multivalent metal ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif10">[59]</xref>.

While revealing the expected oscillatory occupancy pattern, this model fails to describe the experimental data quantitatively. In particular, the first dip of the nucleosome density at position around 147 bp is too sharp in comparison with the experimental curve. This discrepancy has been noted by Riposo and Mozziconacci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Riposo1">[60]</xref>, which they tried to solve mathematically via blurring the precise nucleosome dyad positions by a finite-width Gaussian distribution. A more physically motivated tuning of the model was used to correct for this effect in a recent study by Mobius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Mobius1">[10]</xref>. In the latter work it was shown that allowing DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome makes the distribution smoother and more resembling the experimental one. Yet, the calculation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows that extending the model to allow nucleosome unwrapping brings another problem. Nucleosome unwrapping makes the nucleosome effectively “shorter”, which in turn shortens the NRL.

In particular, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g003">Figure 3C</xref> shows that the introduction of the linker histone H1, while allowing properly changing the NRL, does not lead to the proper shapes of the peaks of the nucleosome density.

<p>The only model change that helped us arriving to the experimentally observed yeast TSS nucleosome distribution was the introduction of the long-range anticooperative interactions between nucleosomes, as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows that the model with <italic>w</italic>(<italic>L</italic>&lt;30 bp) = 0 and <italic>h</italic><sub>max</sub> = 40 bp allows describing the nucleosome distribution around yeast TSSs quite well. Note that the experimentally determined average distance between nucleosomes is around 15 bp, which is less than <italic>V</italic> = 30 bp due to partial nucleosome unwrapping. Several previous publications have also encountered the problem that the theoretically predicted NRL is too short for this experimental system, and attempted to solve it by empirically assuming that nucleosomes cannot form closer than a certain distance (e.g. 10 DNA bp) from the end of one nucleosome to the beginning of the consecutive one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Wang1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Lubliner1">[18]</xref>, or even assuming that the nucleosome core particle contains 158 bp instead of the commonly perceived 147 bp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Rube1">[61]</xref>. However, the latter model fails to describe another yeast strain, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which has NRL = 154 bp, leaving only 7 bp between neighboring nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Lantermann1">[65]</xref>. The 3D structure of the nucleosome is essentially the same in these species, so if one postulates a nucleosome consisting of 158 bp in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, then why <italic>S. pombe</italic> would have different nucleosomes? Therefore, instead of setting the fixed-geometry contact interaction between nucleosome core particles, our model only assumes that nucleosomes need to overcome a certain energy barrier to position themselves closer than a certain distance at a given genomic region. Thus the lower NRL limit determined by long-range interactions is different for different cell types depending on the thermodynamic conditions.</p>
<p>What can be the source of such long-range interactions? One of the differences between <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is that <italic>S. pombe</italic> lacks ISWI remodelers, which require at least a 10 bp DNA linker for their nucleosome-spacing activity, but has an expanded CHD remodeler family instead <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Clapier1">[66]</xref>. Different remodeler composition could explain NRL differences in different species; in addition, the co-evolution of the remodeling system and the nucleosomal DNA code might determine that the DNA sequence is also adapted to this or that NRL in different regions in different species. Another possible justification for long-range nucleosome-nucleosome interactions could be a specific structural nucleosome arrangement in the chromatin fiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Cherstvy3">[67]</xref>. For instance, the geometries and nucleosome axial densities of the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted chromatin fibers in the presence of linker H5 histones were shown to be dramatically different for the NRL of 167 and 197 bp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Routh1">[39]</xref>.

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> NRL is an increasing but saturating function of H1 concentration</title>
<p>Let us compare predictions of the model with available experimental dependences of NRL on the concentration of linker histone H1, [H1]. We will use two experimental examples. In the first example, Oberg and coauthors have systematically studied the effect of the concentration of different histone variants on the NRL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Oberg1">[33]</xref>. In their system, linker histone concentration was “titrated” exogenously in living cells, <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. They have found that for all the histone variants an increase of the NRL with increasing H1 concentration was observed, which saturated at a certain value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The fact that NRL is a smooth function of [H1] speaks against a purely DNA-sequence or remodeler-determined NRL formation mechanism in this case. In addition, a simple competitive model where H1 binds the nucleosomal DNA and excludes nucleosomes cannot explain the saturating behavior of NRL as a function of [H1]. To recapitulate this feature, we have introduced in the model a limiting case of cooperative binding: we prohibit H1 binding if there is no nucleosome in its vicinity. This model keeps nucleosome-H1 and nucleosome-H1-nucleosome distances flexible, but allows not more than one H1 per nucleosome to be bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows that this model leads to the NRL saturation at high H1 concentrations. Furthermore, this modified model predicts the correct slope of the curve and the correct saturation level in comparison with the experiment of Oberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Oberg1">[33]</xref>. This leads us to the refined lattice model for H1-nucleosome interaction, where nucleosomes can bind a small number of H1 molecules, or accommodate different types of nucleosome-H1-nucleosome connectivity, but only less than a critical number of H1 molecules per nucleosome is allowed (one H1 per nucleosome in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This model is consistent with recent simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Pachov1">[70]</xref> and structural data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Harshman1">[62]</xref> which suggest that H1 binds to distinct sites almost exclusively in the nucleosome entry/exit area.</p>

<p>In the second experimental example, Woodcock and colleagues investigated the effect of H1/NCP ratio in different mouse cells where some of H1 variants were knocked out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Woodcock1">[34]</xref>. The authors have found a mostly linear dependence of the NRL on the [H1]/[NCP] ratio, which they have interpreted in terms of the electrostatic screening and mutual charge neutralization of the negative DNA charge by basic histones H1. A similar behavior was also found by Blank and Becker for various smaller charged molecules such as metal cations and polyamines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Blank1">[36]</xref>. Electrostatics is also believed to play a role in the regulation of chromatin states through histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Korolev1">[71]</xref>. Here, our calculations performed in the frame of the lattice model allow to recapitulate the experimentally found NRL dependence on the H1/NCP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, the linear regime observed by Woodcock and colleagues represents only a fraction of the interval of H1 concentrations, where the overall saturating dependence of NRL on the H1 concentration was found by Oberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Oberg1">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Thus, our model is consistent both with the Oberg et al. saturation behavior and with the Woodcock at al. and the Blank and Becker's concept of the electrostatic screening, and provides a deeper understanding and NRL predictions for the wide interval of histone concentrations. This model is not limited to the <italic>in vitro</italic> system consisting of just the DNA and histones. Importantly, it is also readily applicable to more complicated systems where histones are complemented by non-histone chromatin proteins such as HMGN1.

<title>Sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning at mammalian <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions</title>
<p>Let us now return to the sequence-specific NRL effects at genomic regions. Korber and colleagues have noted that the statistical model of Kornberg and Stryer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kornberg2">[43]</xref> predicts a pronounced NRL change with the increase of the nucleosome density (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which they did not observe experimentally upon reconstituting nucleosomes at the DNA sequences enclosing yeast TSSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Korber1">[58]</xref>. Furthermore, subsequent experimental work of Celona et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Celona1">[30]</xref> showed that only weak nucleosomes are being removed upon core histone depletion, while strong nucleosomes remain at their places, effectively keeping the NRL independent of the core histone concentration. In line with this, the authors of a recent Monte Carlo simulation hypothesize that DNA sequence-specific effects have the primary role on nucleosome positioning near TSSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Parmar1">[72]</xref>. To check this hypothesis in a more general context, we have utilized the nucleosome positioning data measured by MNase-seq for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif5">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows that the average nucleosome landscape in mESCs calculated for two different experimental nucleosome datasets from Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif5">[28]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang2">[73]</xref> around bound RNA polymerase (Pol2) from Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Shen1">[74]</xref> is characterized by a strong depletion of the nucleosome density in the region (−1000 bp; +1000 bp) around Pol2 peaks. This is not surprising since most stalled Pol2 reside near the TSS, which is known to be nucleosome-depleted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif5">[28]</xref>. The ∼1 kb nucleosome depletion is combined with the smaller oscillations of the nucleosome coverage centered at the bound Pol2 peaks (the red and green lines in panel 5A). Panel 5B shows the heat map of the nucleosome density for each of the individual genomic regions used in the calculation of the average profile in panel 5B. This heat map also reveals oscillations of the nucleosome density. To check whether these oscillations are only determined by the TSS-induced boundary or also reflected by the DNA sequence, we have calculated nucleosome distributions using the DNA sequence preferences of histone octamer predicted by Segal and coauthors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kaplan1">[13]</xref> (black and blue lines in panel 5A). Surprisingly, this nucleosome pattern also exhibits pronounced oscillations. Furthermore, the NRL hard-wired in the DNA sequence (181.8 bp) appears to be quite similar to the NRL found experimentally for these regions (183.4 bp). While the oscillatory pattern was similar, the ∼1 kb depletion was not recovered in the calculations; instead, the theoretical nucleosome landscape calculated for a very small core histone concentration shows average nucleosome enrichment rather than depletion around bound Pol2 sites. When core histone concentration was increased, we obtained even more pronounced oscillations at an overall a flatter landscape. Panel 5C shows the average raw energy of nucleosome formation predicted by the algorithm of Segal and coauthors around Pol2 bound genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kaplan1">[13]</xref>. The raw energy has a ∼1 kb dip (the nucleosome affinity is the inverse value, which has a peak, explaining the predicted nucleosome enrichment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The oscillations of the energy are not visually apparent from the black curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5C</xref>. To make the oscillations more pronounced, we have calculated the difference between the average raw energy and its fit with the polynomial regression. As a result we obtained the signal with visually detectable oscillations (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This was further Fourier-transformed, which revealed the period of oscillations, 181.3 bp, consistent with panel 5A. These DNA sequence oscillations explain the unexpected result of the nucleosome periodicity predicted from the sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. Importantly, the magnitude of the energy oscillations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5C</xref> is very small for each individual base pair. Yet, these lead to the appreciable oscillations of the nucleosome density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5A</xref> due to synergistic effects: firstly, for each individual nucleosome the contributions of each of the 147 base pairs are added up (if in phase), and secondly, neighboring nucleosomes affect each other through excluded-volume interactions, resulting in the nonlocal effects of local DNA sequence variations. On the other hand, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that these oscillations of the DNA sequence appeared as a consequence rather than the cause of formation of ordered nucleosome arrays through the co-evolution of nucleosome arrangement and the underlying DNA sequence.

<p>As another test case, we have considered NRL around CTCF binding sites in mESCs. CTCF is a zinc-finger protein, which binds to its ∼20 bp recognition motif in ∼40,000 sites throughout the mouse genome. CTCF is implicated in the insulator functions (isolating expressed versus non expressed regions, etc), and is known to be involved in the formation of chromatin loops maintaining 3D chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-VanBortle1">[76]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5D</xref> shows our calculation of the average nucleosome landscape around bound CTCF sites in mESCs without taking into account the competition of CTCF with nucleosomes. As noted previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Valouev1">[27]</xref>, the nucleosome affinity predicted from the DNA sequence at CTCF binding sites is higher than the average. Recently it was shown that differential CTCF binding during stem cell development is determined by the competition with nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif11">[77]</xref>. In line with this, many studies assumed that nucleosome oscillations around CTCF are solely due to their statistical positioning by the boundary created by CTCF. Here, our calculation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5D</xref> shows that the oscillations of nucleosome density can be predicted also from the DNA sequence around validated CTCF binding sites in mESCs without taking into account CTCF binding <italic>per se</italic>. The latter calculation assumes that there is no competition of nucleosome with CTCF. When the binding competition of CTCT with nucleosomes is taken into account, we predict nucleosome depletion instead of enrichment and still measurable oscillations of the nucleosome density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, black line), in agreement with our experimentally observed nucleosome landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, red line). Interestingly, the NRL around CTCF sites observed in the experiment (177.5 bp in Panel 5E, red line) is similar to the NRL predicted without nucleosome/CTCF competition (176.5 in Panel 5D), rather than the NRL that is predicted with CTCF/nucleosome competition (183.1 bp in Panel 5E, black line).</p>
<p>The nucleosome formation energy profiles around CTCF calculated using the methods of Segal and coauthors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kaplan1">[13]</xref> and Tolstorukov and coauthors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Tolstorukov1">[75]</xref> did not reveal apparent oscillations, and the Fourier transformation procedure similar to panel 5C did not reveal the energy signal periodicity around CTCF (data not shown). However, sequence-specific features do exist in the vicinity of CTCF sites. One of such features is the presence of “strong nucleosomes” (SNs). SNs is a new class of nucleosomes reflected by a specific symmetry of the underlying DNA sequence, the 10.4 base periodical (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">RRRRRYYYYY</named-content>)<sub>11</sub> pattern, recently discovered by Trifonov and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Salih1">[78]</xref>. About 291 SNs (24% of all SNs predicted in the annotated mouse genome) reside within 10 kb from bound CTCFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Salih2">[79]</xref>. Panel 5F shows the probability to find SNs as a function of the distance from CTCF. The oscillations are very symmetric on average, although in most cases there is exactly one SN in the vicinity of one CTCF (See Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003698.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Unlike usual nucleosomes predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, strong nucleosomes are not found at the center of CTCF site. Thus, SN provides a second boundary (in addition to CTCF) for positioning the rest of nucleosomes in this region. This situation is different from what would be in the case of a sole CTCF boundary, which explains why the NRL predicted taking into account CTCF/nucleosome competition without the knowledge of SN positions does not coincide with the experimental NRL.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates that sequence-specific effect play an important role in nucleosome positioning at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions. This can explain the puzzle of the NRL independence of the nucleosome density in the chromatin reconstitution at yeast TSSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Korber1">[58]</xref>. In this regime, DNA sequence preferences dominate over non-specific statistical positioning. The latter effect is further illustrated in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003698.s004">Figure S4</xref>. We have selected an exemplary mouse genomic region around one of the CTCF binding sites. For this region, we have performed calculations of the nucleosome binding maps at different nucleosome densities as indicated in the figure. Due to the dominance of sequence-specific effects, the nucleosome map almost does not change during these calculations in terms of the change in the NRL. Thus, in the DNA-sequence-dependent scenario relevant for the situation at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, the dependence of the NRL on histone concentration might be not so pronounced.</p>

<title>Sequence-specificity is not the main NRL determinant in heterochromatin</title>
<p>A situation opposite to the cis-regulatory regions studied above is encountered in highly compacted, mostly transcriptionally inactive, constitutive heterochromatin. For example, mouse pericentric heterochromatin contains tandem DNA repeats with conserved sequence, so called major satellite repeats. From the point of view of the nucleosome positioning code approach, there would be a strong nucleosome positioning preference and the corresponding NRL equal to the length of a single repeat, 234 bp. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows our calculation of the nucleosome occupancy and nucleosome start site probability calculated along 50 tail-to-head satellite repeats using the web server from the Segal lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kaplan1">[13]</xref>. The 234-bp NRL predicted from the DNA sequence would be much larger than genome-average; such a dramatic NRL difference was observed neither in our experimental nucleosome positioning dataset in mouse embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif5">[28]</xref>, nor in the human blood cells studied by Valouev et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Valouev1">[27]</xref>. What we did observe was a nucleosome start site probability broadly scattered along the satellite repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) with the periodicity of preferred nucleosome start sites equal to 10 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The 10-bp periodicity is consistent with previous experimental observations for mouse satellite repeats performed in the pre-NGS era <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang3">[80]</xref> and theoretical predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Trifonov1">[6]</xref>. Interestingly, the distribution of DNA fragment sizes for paired-end DNA sequencing tags mapped to satellite repeats was very broad, with many nucleosomes digested in the middle of the DNA fragment. When we have introduced a constrain that the MNase-seq DNA fragment size corresponding to a mononucleosome should be in the interval 145–150 bp, a different picture emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Surprisingly, we have found two preferred nucleosome positions covering either nucleotides 50 through 200, or nucleotides 130 through 280 (including 40 bp from the start of the next 234-bp repeat). These two nucleosome positions apparently overlap and are mutually exclusive; the only possibility for them to realize we can think of is due to the heterogeneity of the heterochromatin, with one heterochromatin fraction having nucleosomes at positions [50–200], and another fraction having the nucleosome preferentially at [130–280]. On top of this bimodal distribution of two stable nucleosome positions which represent ∼10% of all heterochromaric nucleosomes, the majority of nucleosomes do not conform to any defined positions and only obey the 10-bp periodicity rule for the start sites. Thus, the NRL in heterochromatin is mostly independent of the DNA sequence and regulated by epigenetic variables. The finding above might be true not only for major satellite repeats, but also for other classes of repeats whose length is not a multiple of the NRL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Levitsky1">[81]</xref>. An opposite behavior was shown e.g. for AluSx repeats (313 bp), which can accommodate exactly two nucleosomes centered at well-defined positions within the repeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Reynolds1">[25]</xref>.</p>

<title>Different regimes of the NRL dependence on histone concentrations</title>
<p>The results of this study presented above show that there are three different regimes of NRL dependence on histone concentrations and other related thermodynamic parameters. In one regime, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2</xref>, DNA sequence preferences are negligible (or averaged out due to comparing many unrelated DNA regions with overlapping nucleosome populations) and the major effect is due to statistical positioning of nucleosomes. This is the “classical” regime which scientists usually have in mind when speaking about statistical positioning of nucleosomes. We have systematically identified non-sequence-specific NRL dependence on the concentration of the core and linker histones, the linker protein size, the possibility of nucleosome unwrapping and the short-range and long-range internucleosome interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In this regime, increasing the nucleosome density leads to the NRL decrease due to mutual exclusions of nucleosomes. The predicted magnitude of this effect is comparable with that in the remodeler knock out experiments in <italic>S. pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Hennig1">[31]</xref>. In addition, DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome leads to shortening of the nucleosomal DNA fragment and correspondingly shorter NRLs. Contact nucleosome-nucleosome cooperativity “glues” nucleosomes together and shortens NRL, while restrictive (anticooperative) long-range interactions make NRL larger. The latter effect becomes especially important, since only the introduction of the long-range interactions allowed our successful description of the nucleosome oscillations around yeast TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Long-range internucleosomal interactions arise either due to the cell type-specific remodeler action or due to the intrinsic chromatin fiber structure and determine the lower NRL limit for biological species with short NRL.</p>
<p>In the second regime, DNA sequence preferences of the histone octamer, as well as TF-binding sequence preferences dominate over nonspecific boundary effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In this regime, altering the nucleosome density or changing linker histone concentration only leads to the relative scaling of the well-defined nucleosome landscape, while the peak positions and the NRL remain mostly unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003698.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In analogy with the mouse system studied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003698.s004">S4</xref>, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromatin reconstitution experiments of Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Zhang1">[29]</xref> fall in the sequence-specific regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2</xref>), since in these experiments NRL does not depend on histone concentration. On the other hand, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> remodeler knock out experiments of Hennig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Hennig1">[31]</xref> fall in the sequence-nonspecific regime, since the nucleosome density decrease is compensated by the NRL increase in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Why the two types of yeast experiments belong to two different NRL variation regimes remains unclear. Perhaps, this is because <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin reconstitution is more sensitive to the DNA sequence in comparison to the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In the third regime, which we have exemplified with mouse major satellite repeats in pericentric heterochromatin, strong DNA sequence preferences are overwritten by even stronger constraints of the densely packed heterochromatin. With the same DNA sequence for all major satellite repeats, some of them harbor a nucleosome in the [50–200] position, while others in the [130–280] position. A switch between the two positions might be coupled with structural heterochromatin reorganizations. Notably, these well-defined nucleosomes account for only a ∼10% fraction of all heterochromatin nucleosomes. The rest nucleosomes are more freely arranged, just obeying the 10-bp periodicity rule. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such report about the NRL-switch behavior in heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Importantly, all these regimes can be successfully described by the same biophysical model we presented here. The selection of one of the NRL regimes happens naturally at different genomic regions as a consequence of an intricate interplay of subtle changes of concentrations and geometric parameters. As a proof of principle, the NRL dependence on H1 histone concentrations has been successfully described here for different species, ranging from frog in the experiments of Oberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Oberg1">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4 A, B</xref>) to mouse strains in the experiments of Woodcock and coauthors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Woodcock1">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003698-g004">Figure 4 D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in all studied systems, NRL appeared to be a complicated function depending on a number of parameters, both genetic (DNA sequence) and epigenetic (changes in histone/TF/remodeler concentrations). Thermodynamic NRL regulation is thus an essential part of the control of gene expression.</p>

<p>Aggregate plots for the average experimental nucleosome occupancy around TSSs, bound Pol2 and CTCF peaks were calculated as the average of nucleosome occupancies in a window of −1500 to +1500 bp around a given site using our previously published nucleosome positioning dataset with moderate MNase digestion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif5">[28]</xref>. For each gene the averaged nucleosome profile was normalized to yield the nucleosome occupancy equal to 1 at the leftmost position of the region (−1500 bp from the middle). The coordinates of CTCF binding sites and stalled Pol2 were taken as the summits of the corresponding ChIP-seq peaks determined by the Mouse ENCODE Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Shen1">[74]</xref>. Theoretically predicted nucleosome patterns around TSSs, CTCF and Pol2 were calculated in the same way, using our TFnuc program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif6">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Teif7">[53]</xref> to account for the competitive multiprotein binding and taking as input the DNA sequence preferences for nucleosomes from those determined by Segal and coauthors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003698-Kaplan1">[13]</xref>.</p>
