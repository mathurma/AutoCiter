<abstract>
<p>Cancer researchers have long recognized that somatic mutations are not uniformly distributed within genes. However, most approaches for identifying cancer mutations focus on either the entire-gene or single amino-acid level. We have bridged these two methodologies with a multiscale mutation clustering algorithm that identifies variable length mutation clusters in cancer genes. We ran our algorithm on 539 genes using the combined mutation data in 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 1295 mutation clusters. The resulting mutation clusters cover a wide range of scales and often overlap with many kinds of protein features including structured domains, phosphorylation sites, and known single nucleotide variants. We statistically associated these multiscale clusters with gene expression and drug response data to illuminate the functional and clinical consequences of mutations in our clusters. Interestingly, we find multiple clusters within individual genes that have differential functional associations: these include <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>FUBP1</italic>, and <italic>CDH1</italic>. This methodology has potential implications in identifying protein regions for drug targets, understanding the biological underpinnings of cancer, and personalizing cancer treatments. Toward this end, we have made the mutation clusters and the clustering algorithm available to the public. Clusters and pathway associations can be interactively browsed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://m2c.systemsbiology.net" xlink:type="simple">m2c.systemsbiology.net</ext-link>.

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Identifying driver mutations in cancer has been a major challenge in cancer research, with the ultimate goal of understanding the detailed molecular origins of cancer and providing genetically personalized treatments. For decades, the cancer research community has known that mutations in certain genes—such as tumor suppressors like P53—can drive cancer. In some cases it is also clear that mutations within cancer genes are localized in a single amino—such as the V600E mutation in BRAF. With the existence of large multi-omic data sets including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), it is now possible to apply big data approaches towards both identifying mutation features of interest and understanding their functional consequences. We have bridged the gap between single amino acid mutations and the whole gene view by developing an algorithm that can identify variable length regions within cancer genes that which enriched for mutations. Furthermore, we have been able to integrate our multiscale mutation clusters with additional molecular data to gain insight into possible functional consequences of the clusters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Somatic mutations are amongst the most frequent genomic aberrations associated with cancer. Moreover, primary human cancer samples usually contain tens to hundreds of somatic mutations, depending on the tissue of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref001">1</xref>]. The identification of mutations that alter the function of protein coding genes, and a molecular understanding of the ensuing consequences of such mutations, remains a significant challenge.</p>
<p>To date, millions of distinct somatic mutations have been observed in human cancers through genome wide characterization projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Computational methods are particularly well suited for the assessment of somatic mutations at this scale in order to identify those with cancer-associated functional consequences. To this end, numerous mutation assessment methods have been developed based on a variety of underlying approaches and statistical models. For example, MuSiC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref002">2</xref>], MutSig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref001">1</xref>], and SomInaClust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref003">3</xref>] rank cancer-associated genes based on somatic mutations observed across a cohort of samples and normalized by factors including mutation type propensity, gene length, and replication timing. In addition, methods including PolyPhen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref004">4</xref>], SIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref005">5</xref>], and CADD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref006">6</xref>] utilize prior knowledge such as conservation and machine learning based on disease associated variants to predict functional mutation impact. Yet other methods including OncodriveCLUST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref007">7</xref>] and CLUMPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref008">8</xref>], iPAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref009">9</xref>], and graphPAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref010">10</xref>] take a parameterized, data-driven approach to predict cancer-associated mutations based on spatial clustering of linear sequence, three-dimensional protein structure, and graphical representations thereof. Finally, enrichment of somatic mutations based on functional biological consequences such as protein-protein interaction interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref011">11</xref>] and deregulation of phosphorylation signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref012">12</xref>] have been explored.</p>
<p>Importantly, functional mutations that occur within the coding sequence and are known to be associated with cancer do not occur at random positions. On the contrary, hotspots or clusters are frequently observed as recurrent missense mutations across a significant fraction of cancer samples. These sets of mutations are typically attributed to alterations in function at specific sites of the protein that give rise to a variety of cancer phenotypes. Oftentimes, these mutation clusters can be readily interpreted in the context of their protein structure and function; for example, mutations in the GTP binding pocket of <italic>KRAS</italic> that modulates intrinsic GTPase activity, lead to constitutive activation of <italic>KRAS</italic> and persistent stimulation of downstream signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref014">14</xref>]. Such mutation clusters need not be located within structural protein domains; for example, N-terminal mutations of beta-catenin (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>) affect protein phosphorylation sites and thereby abrogate ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref017">17</xref>]. These mutations then result in beta-catenin accumulating in the nucleus and continuously driving transcription of its target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>While these examples highlight readily identifiable and interpretable focal mutation clusters that lead to cancer-associated effects on protein function, such mutation consequences need not be restricted to dense clusters at just a few amino acid positions in the protein sequence. For example, tumor protein p53 (<italic>TP53</italic>) contains a combination of mutations that are recurrently located at specific amino acids that bind directly to DNA (e.g., R248Q, R273C) as well as more broadly distributed sets of mutations throughout the core DNA binding domain of TP53 that disrupt the folding and stability of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref021">21</xref>]. Additionally, sets of mutations do not only affect individual regions or domains of proteins; rather, functional mutations are observed in distinct clusters within different regions or domains of individual proteins (e.g., <italic>PIK3CA</italic>), indicating the possibility for differential functional consequences of such mutation clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>We have therefore developed a multiscale mutation clustering algorithm (M<sup>2</sup>C) that identifies variable length regions with high mutation density in cancer genes. We have applied our algorithm on hundreds of frequently mutated genes using the combined mutation data in over twenty tumor types from TCGA and identified over a thousand multiscale mutation clusters. We have statistically associated these multiscale clusters with gene expression from TCGA tumor samples and drug response data from cancer cell lines, illuminating the (differential) functional and associated therapeutic consequences of somatic mutations in cancer.</p>

<title>Overview of the approach</title>
<p>We ran M<sup>2</sup>C on the combined mutation calls from 23 cancers (pan-cancer data set is described in T1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>) across 549 genes. Briefly, M<sup>2</sup>C works by smoothing the mutation density at many different amino acid length scales. Then, a mixture model is fit to each scale. Finally, these mixture models are merged together using a greedy algorithm that optimizes an information criterion. We refer to a cluster as an interval along the linear amino acid chain, e.g. <italic>PIK3CA</italic> 339–350. After identifying these clusters, we assigned them as binary features to individual tumor types for each of the 23 cancers. A cluster is assigned as positive (1) to a tumor sample if that sample contains at least one non-synonymous mutation within the cluster and negative (0) otherwise. This assignment allowed us to relate cluster features with gene expression data from 2194 genes in the TCGA dataset. We statistically combined these gene expression associations on the pathway level across 172 pathways linking mutation clusters to pathway-level gene expression changes. We performed a similar analysis on all non-synonymous mutation features (i.e. regardless of whether the mutation is or is not in a cluster). Finally, we linked the multiscale mutation clusters to differential drug response using cancer cell line data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates our approach on <italic>PIK3CA</italic> in breast invasive carcinoma, a prototypical example of how our method identifies multiple mutation clusters with differential associations with gene expression data.

<title>Characterizing multiscale clusters</title>
<p>M<sup>2</sup>C identified a total of 1255 multiscale clusters in 393 of the 549 genes analyzed. These genes were selected by taking the highest ranked genes in MutSig for each cancer type. The 156 genes without any clusters had all their mutations classified as uniform background noise by M<sup>2</sup>C and were omitted from further analysis. The following results indicate that our method finds multiscale regions of proteins which are enriched for mutations and frequently overlap with annotated protein domains. The multiscale clusters span a wide range of lengths: from 1 to 600 amino acids. Additionally, clusters have a highly variable number of mutations: 15 to 338 mutations. Finally, we note that each cluster is given a score which is the log of the ratio of its emission probability from its component of the mixture model to the emission probability under the null hypothesis that mutations are distributed uniformly across the gene. Higher scores indicate increased robustness as shown by cross-validation analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). T2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> details pan-cancer cluster definitions, cluster scores, and overlapping protein domains.</p>
<p>We assigned clusters to specific tumor samples if there was at least one non-synonymous mutation in a sample at an amino acid position within a cluster. By combining tumor samples grouped by tumor tissue of origin, we were able to compare how clusters are assigned to different tumor types. T3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> details cluster assignments to tumor types. When clusters are assigned to specific tumor types, a high variability is seen in the way clusters are distributed between tumor types. On the high end, lung squamous cell carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma have over 80% of their non-synonymous mutations in clusters. On the low end, acute myeloid leukemia and thyroid carcinoma have 23% and 34% of their non-synonymous mutations in clusters, respectively. Neither the total number of non-synonymous mutations nor the total number of synonymous mutations is a good indicator for what percent of mutations are located within clusters in a specific tumor type. Interestingly, the ratio between the percentage of non-synonymous mutations in clusters and the percentage of protein sequence covered by clusters (which contain non-synonymous mutations) is much less variable; for the pan-cancer data set this ratio is 1.88 and when calculated between cancer types ranges from 0.88 (acute myeloid leukemia) to 2.23 (thyroid carcinoma). T4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> gives statistics on the distribution of clusters between different tumor types. Finally, we searched for tumor specific clusters by using Fisher’s exact test to determine if specific tumor types are enriched for specific clusters. We found 426 mutational clusters enriched for a specific tumor type at a false discovery rate of 1% and 996 at a false discovery rate of 10%. Cluster tumor type enrichment results are detailed in T5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>.</p>
<p>We compared the multiscale clusters to a Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) based method called OncodriveCLUST and to protein domains from Pfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref024">24</xref>]. OncodriveCLUST’s approach also uses a kernel smoother to create a mutation density, albeit using only one predefined scale. Despite finding fewer clusters (OncodriveCLUST found 5185 clusters in 514 genes), we find that multiscale clusters tend to be larger and have more mutations. Additionally, multiscale mutation clusters cover (defined as &gt;50% overlap) 48% of the alternative method’s clusters. On the other hand, OncodriveCLUST clusters cover only 18% of the multiscale clusters. Finally, we note that M<sup>2</sup>C has 9% more coverage by protein domains from Pfam compared to OncodriveCLUST (M<sup>2</sup>C has a total of 31% of multiscale clusters located within or overlapping with protein domains). These statistics are summarized in panels A-C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g002">Fig 2</xref>.</p>

<p>We validated the M<sup>2</sup>C robustness by splitting our data set into two equally sized partitions and running the algorithm separately on each partition. We then compared how clusters from the different partitions overlap. We also make use the generative capabilities of the mixture models underlying our algorithm to use each partition’s model to predict the data from the other partition. In brief, we found that M<sup>2</sup>C robustness is dependent on mutation density; clusters with many mutations, regardless of size, tend to be validated across the two different partitions. Less populated small dense clusters are also well conserved. However, larger sparse clusters are more poorly replicated between partitions. Despite these differences, the mixture models generated by each partition do a very good job predicting the data set in the other partition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

<title>Associating clusters with gene expression data</title>
<p>In order to begin to gain an understanding of the functional consequences of mutations in different clusters, we statistically associated gene expression data from TCGA by combining statistics from all gene expression data (i.e., global associations) and from subsets of gene expression data representing molecular pathways (i.e., pathway associations). The statistical associations were carried out on binary vectors that indicate whether a sample in a specific tumor type had a mutation in a specific cluster (1) or not (0). We refer to these binary vectors as cluster features. This association pipeline works by combining P-values from Kruskal-Wallis tests between gene expression data and cluster features with the Empirical Brown’s Method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref025">25</xref>]. This methodology was chosen because, in general, gene expression from a particular pathway is not universally upregulated or downregulated due to cancer mutations. A summary of the results from these associations at different false discovery rates (FDR) can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Further information on the association analysis can be found in the methods section.</p>

<p>In order to assess the robustness of our association methodology, we performed a cross-validation analysis. We measured two different robustness scores. “Association robustness” compares the associations between two data partitions using the same underlying set of clusters. “M<sup>2</sup>C plus association robustness” compares two data partitions each used to generate their own set of clusters which are subsequently analyzed for gene expression associations separately. Our analysis finds association robustness at 80% and M<sup>2</sup>C plus association robustness at 60%. This decrease is consistent with the observation that M<sup>2</sup>C robustness (described previously) is lower for lower scoring clusters, causing a decrease between partitions. However, higher scoring clusters tend to have stronger associations, making M<sup>2</sup>C plus association robustness higher than might be naively expected simply by combining M<sup>2</sup>C association robustness and association robustness. Further information on the cross-validation can be found in the Methods section.</p>
<p>We found that computing associations with gene expression comprises a complementary approach towards ranking cancer genes when compared with other methods such as MutSig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref001">1</xref>]. We compiled a list of the top 67 genes from the MutSig rankings from across all cancer types that represent many of the most important cancer genes (see section B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s008">S1 Text</xref>). At a FDR of 10%, 36% (a total of 24 genes) of the top genes contained at least one mutation cluster that is associated with global or pathway changes in gene expression in a specific tumor type.</p>
<p>Our results from the gene expression analysis highlight that clusters of many different length scales are associated with changes in gene expression, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. This corroborates the fact that functional regions of genes can range in size from single amino acids to multiple protein domains. As discussed later, these associations are often more specific than associations with any-non-synonymous mutation in the same gene. These results indicate the importance of being able to dynamically determine multiscale regions of interest within genes in order to better understand the spectrum of mutations underlying cancer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have found a number of cases where the association P-value between a cluster feature and gene expression data (pathway or global) is lower than the association P-value between the feature (variable) that encodes the occurrence of any non-synonymous mutation. These cases are of special interest because cluster features (i.e. variables that encode the presence or absence of a mutation in a particular cluster) are by definition subsets of the feature that encodes all non-synonymous mutations. This means that cluster features have fewer samples and thus less statistical power to detect associations with expression data. One would statistically expect them to have correspondingly higher P-values. However, in many instances we find that the opposite is the case. These decreased P-values provide additional evidence that mutation clusters can have specific functional consequences and provide a more nuanced view than considering an entire gene. A number of specific examples are highlighted below and a full list of these cases can be found in T6A and T7A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. The pathway association in T7A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> also lists individual genes within a pathway with significantly differential expression between samples with a cluster feature and without. We have also computed pathway and global associations for samples which contain mutations not in any of our clusters. At a false discovery rate of 10%, about 90% of clusters are more strongly associated with a given pathway or global gene expression feature than mutations lying outside of all clusters. In some cases, this is an indication that our clusters are strongly associated with changes in gene expression. In other cases, the change in P-value can be attributed to the smaller sample size of mutations lying outside of all clusters. Therefore the comparison to the any non-synonymous feature, which will always have a larger sample size than the corresponding cluster feature, is more interpretable. A table of associations corresponding to the significant associations in T6A and T7A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> for samples which do not contain mutations in any cluster can be found in T6D and T7D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. Note that associations were not computed if fewer than 5 samples in a given gene and tumor type had non-synonymous mutations outside of all clusters.</p>
<p>Finally, we uncovered a few instances where different cluster features in the same gene are associated at substantially different levels with gene expression data at the pathway or global level. These may be instances of multifunctional genes where mutations in different regions of the same gene have different functional consequences. In the following sections, we highlight specific examples found in our analysis. We note that the following discussion is not exhaustive and many more examples can be found by examining T6A <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> (features associated with global changes in gene expression) and T7A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> (features associated with pathway changes in gene expression).</p>
<p>As a further comparison to our method, we also analyzed global and pathway gene expression associations for OncodriveCLUST clusters and PFAM domains. Significant results for OncodriveCLUST can be found in T6B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> (global) and T7B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> (pathway). Significant results for PFAM domains can be found in and T6C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> (global) and T7C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref> (pathway). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g003">Fig 3</xref> compares the number of cluster features with significant gene expression associations and the total number of associations found by each method. At a false discovery rate of 1%, M<sup>2</sup>C finds a slightly higher percent of clusters with lower P-values than the corresponding any non-synonymous association when compared to OncodriveCLUST and PFAM domains, at 29%, 28%, and 22%, respectively. As the false discovery rate is increased, M<sup>2</sup>C continues to find a higher proportion of more strongly association clusters than OncodriveCLUST, despite typically finding fewer significant associations in total. Interestingly, at higher false discovery rates PFAM domains are the most likely to have a lower association P-values than the corresponding any non-synonymous association. The strong associations from PFAM domains are likely due to the overall large length and amino acid counts inside these domains which has the drawback that they contain much less positional information compared to the clustering methods.

<title>Clusters associated with global changes in gene expression</title>
<p>We identified highly cancer-related clusters in specific tumor types that are significantly associated with global changes in gene expression. In the cases of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic>, different clusters have widely different association levels with global changes in gene expression. This may be a statistical indicator of different mutation clusters within a single gene affecting the cellular environment in different ways. A full list of global gene expression associations can be found in T6A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. Here, we highlight several well-known and novel clusters in the cancer literature recovered by M<sup>2</sup>C:</p>
<p>Two of <italic>PIK3CA’s</italic> eleven mutation clusters are associated with global changes of gene expression in breast invasive carcinoma: amino acid positions 539–547 and 1043–1049. We note that the first clusters are significantly enriched for mutations in the following tumor types: breast invasive carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (FDR &lt; 1%). The second cluster is significantly enriched for mutations in breast invasive carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (FDR &lt; 1%). The 539–547 cluster contains three previously studied residues in an α-helical region which have been shown to increase the enzyme’s activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref022">22</xref>]. A hotspot point mutation at 1047 inside the 1043–1049 mutation cluster has been speculated to affect the position and mobility of the activation loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref027">27</xref>]. Interestingly, despite approximately 20% fewer mutations, the 539–547 cluster has a much lower global gene expression association P-value (about 6 orders of magnitude smaller), signifying that perhaps mutations in this cluster have different functional consequences. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g004">Fig 4A</xref> the 539–547 region of PIK3CA may be directly involved in binding to PIK3R1, providing another interpretation for the large association with changes in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref028">28</xref>]. As one of the best studied cancer genes, it is unsurprising that many additional associations and cluster-tumor enrichments exist for PIK3CA which are detailed in our <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>.</p>

This cluster is associated with global changes in gene expression in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. The cluster is also enriched for mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (FDR &lt; 5%), as well as in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (FDR &lt; 1%). Previously, increased levels of <italic>ROBO3</italic> expression have been associated with metastasis in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref030">30</xref>]. However, to our knowledge somatic mutations in this region have not been extensively studied. Furthermore, we note that <italic>ROBO3</italic> is ranked only 15540 in MutSig for uterine cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref001">1</xref>]. Thus this gene might be a candidate for further study of its role in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and possibly the other tumor types mentioned above.</p>
<p><italic>GATA3</italic> has a subset of three clusters in breast invasive carcinoma all containing predominantly nonsense (i.e. frameshift, indel, or stop) mutations: amino acids 325–334 with 15 mutations, amino acids 390–421 with 22 mutations and amino acids 429–443 with 15 mutations. We note that the most densely populated of these clusters occurs after the zinc finger binding domain while the first cluster occurs within the binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref029">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the 390–421 cluster is substantially more associated with global changes in gene expression than either of the other two clusters with a P-value nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower. Different <italic>GATA3</italic> mutations have been associated with Luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref031">31</xref>] and changes in survival prognoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref032">32</xref>].

<title>Clusters associated with pathway level changes in gene expression</title>
<p>We identified significant pathway associations with clusters in specific tumor types. These pathway associations go beyond simply implicating certain mutation clusters in cancer by shedding light on possible phenotypic effects of each cluster. At a false discovery rate of 10%, all of the genes associated with global changes in gene expression were also associated with at least one pathway (and usually with many pathways).This included 24 of 67 top ranked cancer genes from MutSig. These results are not surprising because each set of genes in a pathway is a subset of the global gene expression data. However, we note that by restricting our analysis to individual pathways, novel clusters associated with gene expression changes were detected indicating that this analysis is more nuanced. For a complete list of cluster pathway associations see T7A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. This table also included specific gene expression features in each pathway which are strongly associated with a mutation cluster. Below we discuss several examples of specific clusters which are associated with pathways but are not associated with global changes of gene expression.</p>
<p><italic>ZBTB20</italic> has a cluster from 681–714. This cluster is associated with 9 pathways related to angiogenesis and regulation of the cell cycle in gastric adenocarcinoma. Previously single nucleotide mutations in <italic>ZBTB20</italic> have been associated with gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref033">33</xref>]. We hypothesize that a larger region of the <italic>ZBTB20</italic> gene as represented by this mutation cluster may be involved in gastric oncogenesis. Specifically, the frameshift deletions between the two zinc finger domains likely disrupt DNA binding and the C-terminal function of the protein. We note that this cluster is enriched in gastric cancer along with two other clusters in <italic>ZBTB20</italic>, 190–248 and 345–504 (FDR &lt; 1%). The 190–248 cluster is also enriched for mutations in low grade glioma (FDR &lt; 10%).</p>
<p><italic>PPP2R1A</italic> has a cluster from 167–183 that overlaps a HEAT domain motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref034">34</xref>]. This cluster is associated with pathways related to cell differentiation and <italic>MAPK</italic> signaling in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. This gene has also been implicated previously in uterine and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref035">35</xref>]. This cluster is enriched for mutations in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma (FDR &lt; 1%). Additionally, the 237–275 in <italic>PPP2R1A</italic> is enriched for mutations in lung squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer (FDR&lt;10%). The 391–490 cluster is enriched for mutations in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (FDR &lt;1%).</p>
<p><italic>CHD4</italic> is a chromatin helicase remodeling protein. It has a cluster from 945–1016. This cluster is associated with two pathways in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.

<title>Clusters can produce stronger pathway and global gene expression associations</title>
<p>We identified statistically significant clusters in specific tumor types with a lower combined P-value across all gene expression features than the corresponding any non-synonymous mutation feature in a specific tumor type. These results are annotated in T6A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. As examples, this analysis picks up two well-known mutation sites. Our algorithm detected a cluster in <italic>BRAF</italic> from amino acids 600 to 601 which is more significantly associated with global changes in gene expression (P&lt;10<sup>−13</sup> with 106 non-synonymous mutations) in skin cutaneous melanoma despite having fewer mutations than the any non-synonymous feature (P&lt;10<sup>−10</sup> with 126 total non-synonymous mutations across the entire gene). Similarly, in thyroid carcinoma the 600–601 mutation cluster has 235 non-synonymous mutations and is more significantly associated to global changes in gene expression (P&lt;10<sup>−82</sup>) than any-non-synonymous mutation which has 237 total non-synonymous mutations (P&lt;10<sup>−80</sup>). These are common mutations previously implicated in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, the 25–45 amino acid region of <italic>Beta-catenin</italic> (<italic>CTNNB1)</italic> is found to be more significantly associated with global changes in gene expression (P&lt;10<sup>−24</sup> with 67 non-synonymous mutations in the cluster) than all non-synonymous mutations in the gene (P&lt;10<sup>−21</sup> with 80 total non-synonymous mutations in the gene) in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. A similar result is seen in liver hepatocellular carcinoma where the cluster is more significantly associated with global change in gene expression (P&lt;10<sup>−14</sup> with 37 non-synonymous mutations in the cluster) than all non-synonymous mutations in the gene (P&lt;10<sup>−12</sup> with 53 non-synonymous mutations). This cluster is also enriched for mutations Adrenocortical carcinoma (FDR &lt; 5%), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (FDR &lt; 1%) and in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (FDR &lt; 1%). <italic>Beta-catenin</italic> is known to be implicated in numerous types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref038">38</xref>]. This region corresponds closely to a region of phosphorylated peptides along the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> chain which are known to regulate the degradation of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref040">40</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows the structure of the N-terminus region of <italic>Beta-catenin</italic> located within the 25–45 amino acid cluster bound to the WD40 domain of <italic>β-TrCP1 (BTRC)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref041">41</xref>]. Mutations in this cluster are likely to affect this binding and thereby the regulation of <italic>Beta-catenin</italic>. The fact that this region is not an annotated protein domain illustrates the flexible nature of M<sup>2</sup>C in picking out different kinds of functional regions of interest.</p>
<p>We also identified cluster pathway associations in specific tumor types with lower pathway-cluster P-values than the corresponding any non-synonymous mutation feature in the same tumor type. These results are annotated in T7A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. One example is the 248–254 cluster in <italic>FGFR3</italic> in bladder urothelial carcinoma. Point mutations in this region have been previously implicated in low grade glioma tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref042">42</xref>]. We note that mutations in this region are more significantly associated with 10 pathways than the any non-synonymous feature. These pathways are involved in a large number of molecular processes ranging from cell cycle control to <italic>Reelin</italic> signaling. This suggests diversity in the role of <italic>FGFR3</italic> as an oncogene in bladder cancer. This cluster is also enriched for mutations in both bladder cancer (FDR &lt; 1%) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (FDR &lt; 10%). Another example is the 88–98 cluster in <italic>PGM5</italic> in gastric adenocarcinoma which is more significantly associated with 12 pathways when compared to any non-synonymous mutation in the same gene. We note that this cluster is enriched for mutations in gastric cancer (FDR &lt; 1%) and the 456–522 cluster is enriched in lung adenocarcinoma (FDR &lt; 5%). Although <italic>PGM5</italic> has been ranked as a possible cancer gene according to MutSig, to the best of our knowledge this particular region has not been studied.</p>
<p>These cases demonstrate how decreasing sample size by considering a specific cluster as opposed to a specific gene can provide a more nuanced lens for finding statistical associations and aid in inferring the functional consequences of mutations. This occurs because clusters can represent functional regions of a gene and thereby limit the analysis to mutations within that region. This spatial specificity has the effect of excluding background mutations outside the cluster from the analysis.</p>

The 88–206 cluster overlaps well with a KH-1 domain which is involved in RNA and DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref044">44</xref>]. The second cluster does not overlap with any known domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref029">29</xref>]. One possible explanation is that nonsense mutations earlier in the protein sequence result in total loss of function while nonsense mutations later in the sequence only effect the end of the protein structure. This could result in differential effects from mutations in these two clusters. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s002">S2 Fig</xref> for an association heatmap.</p>
<p><italic>E-Cadherin</italic> has 3 clusters with differential pathway associations in breast invasive carcinoma. All these clusters have predominantly nonsense mutations. Of particular interest are the second two clusters. The cluster from 144–222 occurs at the beginning of the first cadherin domain in the protein and the cluster from 644–733 occurs towards the end of the last (fifth) cadherin domain in the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref045">45</xref>]. It is possible that the 144–222 cluster interferes with the ability of the protein to insert itself into the cellular membrane. On the other hand, the 644–733 cluster may not interfere with membrane insertion and only affect the cytoplasmic part of the domain.

<title>Mutation clusters help to explain differential drug response in cancer cell lines</title>
<p>After having established that the location of a mutation in a gene, i.e. in a cluster identified by M<sup>2</sup>C, is associated with differences in gene expression, we aimed to establish whether mutation clusters could be therapeutically relevant. To this end, we applied the mutation clusters to a large cancer cell line drug screening effort; the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref047">47</xref>]. We chose to use drug response measurements in cancer cell lines as an indication of the functional importance of the mutation clusters.</p>
<p>Data obtained from GDSC included the drug response to 142 anti-cancer drugs across 714 cell lines as well as non-synonymous mutation calls for 77 known cancer genes across these cell lines. First, we established that the clusters identified using M<sup>2</sup>C on the TCGA data were enriched for mutations found in the cell lines. Specifically, for the 17 genes with at least 10 mutations across the cell lines, 14 showed strong enrichment of mutations in the M<sup>2</sup>C clusters (p-value ≤ 0.05, FDR ≤ 5%, T12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>). For 12 of these genes, there were at least 5 cell lines that had a mutation in one of the mutation clusters that we identified using M<sup>2</sup>C. We performed association tests between the drug response for each of the drugs, as expressed in IC50 values, and the mutation clusters with at least 5 mutations as well as the any non-synonymous mutation feature for these 12 genes. See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Methods</xref> section for details.</p>
<p>Using an FDR of 10% we found 176 significant associations between the drug response of a drug and either a mutation cluster (64) or the any non-synonymous mutation feature (112) of a gene. Significant associations were found for all 12 genes across 77 of the 142 drugs. There were 130 gene-drug combinations, where either or both a mutation cluster and the any non-synonymous mutation feature of the gene were associated with the response to a drug. Interestingly, of these 130 cases, there were 35 (27%) gene-drug combinations where a mutation cluster in the gene showed a stronger association with drug response than the any non-synonymous mutation feature (T13 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>).</p>
<p>Amongst these 35 cases, we found many known activating hotspot mutations of genes in the <italic>MAPK</italic> pathway. Specifically, there are 10 drug associations with the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation cluster 600–601, 6 with <italic>NRAS</italic> mutation cluster at amino acid 61 and 4 with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation cluster 12–13. These well-known examples can be interpreted as a positive control of the importance of considering mutation clusters compared to the mutations across the whole gene. Additionally, there are 5 drug associations with the various mutation clusters that we found for tumor suppressor <italic>TP53</italic>. This is consistent with <italic>TP53</italic> being the most prominent tumor suppressor gene. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g006">Fig 6</xref> we highlight two examples where drug response is more strongly predicted by a mutation cluster than by any non-synonymous mutation in the same gene. First, we observed that cell lines with mutations in the cluster 116–146 in <italic>PTEN</italic> strongly responded to mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus, whereas mutations across the entire gene showed only a small indication of drug sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Second, we observed that cell lines with mutations in the cluster 1043–1049 in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> showed a stronger response to a <italic>PI3K</italic> beta inhibitor than other mutation clusters or the any non-synonymous mutation feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This corresponds with our observation that in breast cancer this same mutation cluster is very strongly associated with global changes in gene expression compared to other clusters in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have identified multiscale mutation clusters in genes using a pan-cancer data set. Previous approaches have focused on short (frequently single) amino-acid hotspots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref007">7</xref>] as well as identifying globally mutation enriched cancer genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref001">1</xref>]. Our method (M<sup>2</sup>C) dynamically combines these two approaches by searching for variable-length regions of interest within individual genes. We have shown that M<sup>2</sup>C clusters are indeed multiscale covering a wide range of length scales and can be detected in genes with variable mutation density. These clusters frequently overlap with protein domains, but also cover regions where no known domain exists. We show that many of the clusters found by M<sup>2</sup>C are representative of functional regions of proteins where mutations have a larger effect in terms of influencing the hallmarks of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref048">48</xref>]. M<sup>2</sup>C represents a data driven approach towards systematically identifying regions of interest inside of genes with many areas for further investigation and improvement. Firstly, any statistical algorithm will only improve in accuracy as newer and larger data sets are generated. As more cancer tumors are sequenced, we expect our method to detect more mutation clusters, in particular novel clusters in under-studied cancer genes. Secondly, our mutation clustering methodology is sequence based; we suspect that a three dimensional version of such a multiscale algorithm–which implicitly takes protein structure into account–would result in an improvement in identifying functional mutation clusters. Approaches to detect mutation hotspots in 3D structures already exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref049">49</xref>] but they are not based on a multiscale framework. It is likely that many of our one-dimensional clusters, if mapped onto the 3D structure of a protein, would merge together. A future direction is to carry out this mapping and determine more realistic structural mutation clusters. We also suspect that such an approach would further increase statistical power.</p>
<p>In order to identify important clusters and shed light on their function, we examined cluster gene-expression associations both globally and on a pathway level. In this analysis, we have highlighted a number of clusters that we believe are strongly implicated as driver clusters in diverse tumor types due to global gene expression associations. Additionally our pathway level of analysis has helped reveal more specific functional associations between mutation clusters and gene expression. Furthermore, we have shown that certain genes contain multiple clusters that may have different functional consequences, suggesting that different mutations in these genes may play different roles in cancer onset and progression based upon the location of the mutation. Finally, we investigated whether mutation clusters are associated with drug response data in cancer cell lines and found many mutation clusters which are associated with differential drug sensitivity. These findings emphasizes the importance of taking a flexible approach in terms of identifying genomic features–specifically that neither an entire gene approach nor a single amino acid approach is necessarily sufficient.</p>

<title>Identifying multiscale clusters</title>
<p>An initial list of 628 genes was compiled by taking the highest ranked genes from MutSig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref001">1</xref>], i.e. the most significantly frequently mutated genes, using a q-value threshold of 0.1. (The MutSig results that we used in this work are based on the October 2014 analysis run of the Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center Firehose pipeline, available through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ezid.cdlib.org/id/doi:10.7908/C1K64H78" xlink:type="simple">http://ezid.cdlib.org/id/doi:10.7908/C1K64H78</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/analyses__2014_10_17/data/" xlink:type="simple">http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/analyses__2014_10_17/data/</ext-link>). These genes were further filtered to ensure that there are in total at least 15 mutations in each gene across all 23 cancer types considered. This resulted in a list of 549 genes on which we ran our multiscale clustering algorithm. The cancer types considered are: ACC, BLCA, BRCA, CESC, COAD, GBM, HNSC, KICH, KIRC, KIRP, LAML, LGG, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, OV, PRAD, READ, SKCM, STAD, THCA, UCEC, and UCS. Full names can be found in T1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. The raw mutation data we used for clustering can be found in T10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>.</p>
<p>Clusters are identified using all mutations combined from the pan-cancer data set to increase statistical power. These files are created from TCGA mutation annotation format (MAF) files and annotated with Annovar (section B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s008">S1 Text</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Our multiscale mutation clustering algorithm (M<sup>2</sup>C) identifies mutation clusters at multiple scales. Each scale represents different sized genetic features. First, M<sup>2</sup>C converts TCGA mutation calls in amino acid space from all 23 cancers into multiple continuous probability density functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and section C step 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s008">S1 Text</xref>). This smoothing is done using a kernel density estimate (KDE) with a Gaussian kernel at 28 different bandwidths between 2 and 450 (amino acids units). Each bandwidth represents a different length scale of amino acid features ranging from single amino acids to entire protein domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g007">Fig 7B</xref> and section C step 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s008">S1 Text</xref>). These KDEs are each used to seed a multivariate mixture model consisting of <italic>n</italic> Gaussians and 1 uniform distribution, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of local maxima in a given KDE. The noise weight is initially estimated by the fraction of synonymous mutations in the gene. The means of each Gaussian are initialized as the locations of the local maxima of the KDE. The standard deviation of each Gaussian is set as the distance between the two adjacent local minima around a given maxima. Finally, the weight of each Gaussian in the mixture model is estimated by the density at the local maxima minus one-n<sup>th</sup> of the noise weight (section C step 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s008">S1 Text</xref>). An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm then optimizes the mixture model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g007">Fig 7C</xref> blue bars). This process results in a set of clusters for each scale.</p>

<p>In order to generate a single set of multiscale clusters, the mixture models from each different scale are merged using a greedy algorithm. The clusters resulting from the EM algorithm for each scale with at least 15 mutations are placed in binary tree using Scipy’s hierarchical clustering function (section C step 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s008">S1 Text</xref>). The cutoff of 15 was chosen to ensure that clusters had sufficient mutations for further statistical analysis. The unsigned area between the two Gaussian curves is used as the distance metric. The binary tree is flattened using a recursive greedy algorithm to minimize the Akaike Information Criteria with finite size correction (AICc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref051">51</xref>]. In short, given any two sets of clusters the algorithm finds the set of non-overlapping clusters which minimize the AICc. Although the enumeration of all non-overlapping sets of clusters is a computationally costly problem, by placing the clusters in a tree and performing this enumeration recursively the scale of the problem is reduced (section C step 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s008">S1 Text</xref>). M<sup>2</sup>C results in a single set of non-overlapping multi-scale clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g007">Fig 7C</xref> red bars). We refer to clusters as a pair of amino acid positions <italic>x-y</italic> with <italic>x</italic> being the start of the cluster and <italic>y</italic> being the end of the cluster.</p>

<title>Multiscale mutation algorithm cross-validation analysis</title>
<p>In order to test the robustness of the M<sup>2</sup>C algorithm (referred to as M<sup>2</sup>C plus robustness), we split the entire underlying mutation data into two partitions and used each partition to generate a new mixture model for each gene. We then compared the resulting clusters from each partition. First, we compared the log-likelihoods of the mixture model on the training data (i.e. data from the partition which generated the model) to the log-likelihood of the mixture model on the validation data (the other partition). The log-likelihoods of the two models are highly correlated; Spearman correlation = .99, P≈0. These results are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g002">Fig 2</xref> and indicate that the statistical model underlying M<sup>2</sup>C is robust. We also calculated the percent of clusters conserved between the two partitions. We define ‘conserved’ to mean that for two clusters in the same gene from different partitions, one of the clusters overlaps the other by at least 50%. Our cross-validation analysis shows that on average M<sup>2</sup>C robustness is about 40%, meaning about 40% of clusters are conserved. However, we further note that smaller denser clusters are more highly conserved and overlap by a greater percentage between partitions than large sparse clusters. The cluster score provides a good indication of how robust a cluster is likely to be, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s004">S4 Fig</xref>.</p>

<title>Integrating clusters with gene expression data</title>
<p>We created 23 binary feature matrices, one for each cancer type. A binary feature matrix represents which tumor samples contain mutations in which clusters. A tumor sample is said to be positive (1) for a given cluster if it contains a non-synonymous or nonsense mutation within the cluster (see boxes B and C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005347.g007">Fig 7</xref> for an illustration). Additionally we defined an ‘any non-synonymous mutation feature’ for each gene. A gene is said to have any non-synonymous mutation if it contains a non-synonymous mutation inside or outside of a cluster.</p>
<p>We used the binary feature matrices to compare cluster assignments within tumor samples to gene expression data from the TCGA. This analysis was carried out separately for each cancer type. We used a Kruskal-Wallis test between features in the binary feature matrix and 2194 gene expression features. These features were chosen based upon the genes in the NCI pathway interaction database (PID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref053">53</xref>]. In each test, we used data from all tumors in each cancer type. Cluster features and any non-synonymous features with fewer than 5 positive tumor samples were excluded from this analysis.

<title>Gene expression pathway association cross-validation</title>
<p>In order to ensure that our gene expression association pipeline is robust, we performed a cross-validation analysis. We used this analysis to calculate to robustness metrics. Association robustness measures the robustness of the gene expression association pipeline independently of the clustering pipeline. M<sup>2</sup>C plus association robustness measures the gene expression association pipeline combined with the M<sup>2</sup>C algorithm. First, we selected a subset of our data corresponding to all gene-tumor type pairs with significant global or pathway associations. This subset is made up of 369 significant pairs from 226 genes across 22 tumor types. For each of these gene-tumor type pairs, we independently partitioned the entire data set into two partitions each corresponding to an equal number of samples across all 23 cancers. This partitioning was done ensuring that the number of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations was about equal between partitions. We then re-ran M<sup>2</sup>C on each partition, resulting in two sets of clusters. For each set of clusters, we projected data from the training partition and the validating partition (only considering one specific tumor type) to generate binary cluster features. We ran these features through our gene expression association pipeline and carried out significance testing at a false discovery rate of 10%. To calculate association robustness, we compared significant associations from the two partitions projected onto the same set of clusters and found that 85% of significant associations were conserved between partitions. In addition, we found a high correlation between the association log P-values between conserved significant associations between partitions: spearman correlation = 0.76, P&lt;10<sup>−73</sup>. To calculate M<sup>2</sup>C plus association robustness, we further compared associations between different sets of clusters (each generated by a different partition). For this comparison, we projected the data from a given partition onto the corresponding clusters to generate feature vectors which were used for the gene expression association analysis. An association is said to be conserved if that association is significant (at FDR = 10%) for two clusters in the same gene where either cluster covers the other cluster by at least 50%. Between separate sets of clusters, we found that 63% of associations were conserved. The conserved associations also showed a high degree of correlation in their log P-values: spearman correlation = .87, P&lt;10<sup>−56</sup>.

<title>Calculating significant single gene expression features</title>
<p>In the pathway association table (T7A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>), we have included lists of significantly differentially expressed gene expression features within a pathway that are strongly associated to a cluster (or any non-synonymous mutation). To determine if a gene expression feature is upregulated or downregulated, we compared the mean gene expression for samples which contained a non-synonymous mutation in that cluster (or any non-synonymous mutation) to the mean gene expression for samples which do not contain such a mutation. We used the Kruskal Wallis test P-values we had already computed in our analysis pipeline to determine significance, correcting for multiple testing separately for every pathway using the Benjamini–Hochberg method at a false discovery rate of 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref052">52</xref>].</p>

<title>Drug response analysis of cancer cell lines</title>
<p>We used a slightly expanded version of a previously published cancer cell line dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref047">47</xref>]. Specifically, the dataset contained 714 cell lines and 142 anti-cancer drugs. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations at 72 hours (IC50s) obtained in this dataset were used to represent the drug response. In this work, IC50s were recorded as the natural logarithm of the half-maximal inhibitory μM concentration. The drug screening dataset is incomplete, i.e. not all 142 drugs have been screened across all 714 cell lines. In total 81,700 IC50s were measured and 19,688 (19%) were missing values. The statistical tests were applied to each drug separately; cell lines that lack an IC50 were not used. We did not impute missing IC50s. This cell line dataset contains non-synonymous mutation calls for 77 known cancer genes across these cell lines based on capillary sequencing. Additional information on these data is found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005347.ref047">47</xref>] and on the Genomics of Drugs Sensitivity in Cancer webpages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerrxgene.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cancerrxgene.org/</ext-link>). The data as used in this manuscript can be found in T11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>.</p>
<p>For each of the genes, we created a binary ‘any non-synonymous mutation’ feature, which was 1 for all cell lines with a non-synonymous mutation in the gene and 0 otherwise. Also, for each of genes we created binary mutation cluster features using the clusters identified by M<sup>2</sup>C on the TCGA data. Specifically, the binary mutation cluster feature is 1 when the cell line has a non-synonymous mutation in the cluster and 0 otherwise. We discarded all features that had less than 5 1’s. Then, for each combination of a binary mutation feature and a drug we applied a simple Kruskal-Wallis test to test whether the group of cases (1’s in the binary mutation feature) had an equal median IC50 compared to the control group (0’s in the binary mutation feature). Low P-value indicates a significant difference in the median IC50s between the two groups. P-values for all combinations are given in T13 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005347.s006">S1 Tables</xref>. Results were considered significant at a FDR of 10%.</p>
