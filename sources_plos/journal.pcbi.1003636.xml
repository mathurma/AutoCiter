<abstract>
<p>Eukaryotic transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins perform a wide diversity of critical cellular functions, but remain structurally largely uncharacterized and their high-resolution structure prediction is currently hindered by the lack of close structural homologues. To address this problem, we present a novel and generic method for accurately modeling large TMH protein structures from distant homologues exhibiting distinct loop and TMH conformations. Models of the adenosine A2AR and chemokine CXCR4 receptors were first ranked in GPCR-DOCK blind prediction contests in the receptor structure accuracy category. In a benchmark of 50 TMH protein homolog pairs of diverse topology (from 5 to 12 TMHs), size (from 183 to 420 residues) and sequence identity (from 15% to 70%), the method improves most starting templates, and achieves near-atomic accuracy prediction of membrane-embedded regions. Unlike starting templates, the models are of suitable quality for computer-based protein engineering: redesigned models and redesigned X-ray structures exhibit very similar native interactions. The method should prove useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Membrane proteins perform crucial cellular functions and can be involved in serious diseases but remain difficult to study experimentally. Hence, high-resolution membrane protein structures are scarce which hinders the design of selective therapeutics and of receptors with novel function for systems/synthetic biology applications. The computational modeling of membrane protein structures represents an important alternative approach but, to achieve high accuracy, usually requires structural information from closely related proteins currently unavailable for most membrane proteins. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel method to predict membrane protein structures from the structures of non-closely related proteins that differ both in loop and transmembrane regions. Using this approach, we show that a large diversity of membrane proteins can be reconstructed at a level of accuracy suitable for computer-based protein engineering applications. Because requiring information from a single distant homolog only, we expect that around 60% of human membrane proteins can reliably be modeled using our approach, thereby allowing precise structure/function studies on a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized membrane proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Membrane proteins perform a wide diversity of critical functions in living cells but are also involved in serious diseases and represent more than 60% of current drug targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Yildirim1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Arinaminpathy1">[2]</xref>. Despite recent tremendous progress in membrane protein expression, biochemistry and X-ray crystallography, eukaryotic membrane protein structures remain difficult to characterize experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Bill1">[3]</xref>. The lack of high-resolution structures hinders the design of more effective therapeutics and of receptors with novel function for systems/synthetic biology applications which rely on atomic-resolution information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Baker1">[4]</xref>. The high-resolution prediction of membrane protein structures is therefore an important alternative approach but remains a major challenge in absence of close structural homologues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Forrest1">[5]</xref>. Although numerous methods have been developed to model G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Shacham1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Bhattacharya1">[9]</xref>, much fewer techniques have been developed and applied to the entire class of alpha helical membrane proteins. Current state-of-the-art <italic>de novo</italic> structure prediction techniques of alpha helical membrane proteins can generate low-resolution models with native-like topologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Hopf1">[12]</xref> and, despite some insightful applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Forrest2">[13]</xref>, most current comparative modeling methods do not significantly improve starting templates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Kufareva1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Michino1">[15]</xref>. The main structural differences between distant homolog transmembrane alpha-helical (TMH) proteins are found in loop regions and in helical conformations shaping TMH core structures and ligand/effector binding sites. While the problem of rebuilding protein loops has been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Qian1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Totrov1">[17]</xref>, the accurate modeling of membrane protein structures from distant homologues diverging in both loop and TMH core regions is a remaining unsolved challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Forrest1">[5]</xref>. The origins of TMH conformational diversity are multiple and range from the presence of localized sequence-specific distortions (e.g. Proline-induced kinks) to local bends and global tilts stabilized by specific tertiary contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Yohannan1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Riek1">[23]</xref>. Many of these features cannot be accurately predicted from sequence information alone and requires the explicit modeling of atom-level physical interactions stabilizing these structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Yohannan1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Hall1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth2">[24]</xref>. The large size of TM proteins and associated number of degrees of freedom combined with the ruggedness of the all-atom energy landscape make their prediction at atomic resolution computationally intractable using an exhaustive conformational search in torsional angle space.</p>
<p>To address this problem, we have developed a general modeling strategy based on efficient sampling techniques of alternative TMH structures to reconstruct both TMH core and loop regions from distant structural homologues. The method was stringently validated in two blind predictions where the generated models were top-ranked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Kufareva1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Michino1">[15]</xref> and in a large benchmark dominated by pairs of membrane protein distant homologues where starting templates were almost all significantly improved. Computational design calculations suggest that the models should be of suitable accuracy for rational protein engineering applications.</p>

<title>Approach</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>, multiple sequence alignments using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Soding1">[25]</xref> are first performed to identify structural homologues that best align with the target sequence. The quality of the alignment in the TMH regions leads to two different model rebuilding strategies: 1) If the alignment in the TMH regions does not exhibit significant gaps, if the positions of coils or residues promoting local distortions are identical and if TMHs are predicted to have similar length, then target and template TMH structures are likely very similar (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>). In this situation, the template TMH structure is first kept fixed onto which loops diverging between target and template are reconstructed <italic>de novo</italic> using fragment insertion techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Qian1">[16]</xref>. The reconstructed models are then refined at the all-atom level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth2">[24]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). 2) If one of the above-mentioned conditions is not satisfied however, target and template TMH structures may differ significantly and the target TMH region is also reconstructed as described below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). TMH structures mostly sit in the hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane disfavoring any unsatisfied polar atom. Therefore, we reasoned that, except in local bends or kinked regions where hydrogen-bond networks may be partially disrupted, most TMH regions to be rebuilt adopt helical conformations. Previous work also suggests that most bent helices can be approximated by straight TMH fragments away from the local distortion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth2">[24]</xref> which can adopt diverse structures (from a 3<sub>10</sub> turn to a π helix) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Yohannan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Yohannan2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Riek1">[23]</xref>. To efficiently identify alternative low-energy TMH conformations, each TMH fragment away from local predicted bends (that usually span from 4 to 6 residues) is first modeled as a rigid-body helix and its conformation optimized in a low-resolution search sampling helical rigid-body degrees of freedom (see Method). This low-resolution search averages out side-chain conformations, effectively flattening the conformational free energy landscape and allows the rapid identification of low-energy TMH conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth1">[10]</xref> with alternative interhelical and/or kink angles. Loop and local TMH regions around bends or kinks are then rebuilt using fragment insertion techniques and the fully-reconstructed low-resolution structures are refined at all-atom to identify the lowest-energy native-like structures. At this stage, global deformations of TMH stabilized by short-range atom-level tertiary interactions can be identified and selected by energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth2">[24]</xref>. To avoid sampling regions of the conformational space unlikely to be occupied by the peptide chain, distance constraints are applied to the template structure at pairs of residues in proximity and conserved in both target and template sequences (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>).</p>

A kinked helix is defined by 3 regions: An N- and C-terminal helix fragment separated by a distorted bend region (typically 4 to 6 residues N-terminal to a Proline for example) which can adopt a large diversity of local structures (3<sub>10</sub> to π turns) and is modeled de novo using fragment insertion techniques. Each helix fragment is treated as a rigid-body and defined by a helical axis (m for “moveable” and f for “fixed” defining the reference state). The m helix is moved with regard to the f helix according to the following degrees of freedom: 1) Distance between the C-terminal position of the m helix and the N-terminal position of the f helix (dotted red line allowing to sample a hemispherical surface shown in red). 2) Tilt angle between the m and f vectors sampled so that the projection of the N-terminal position of the m helix (black dotted line) on a plane orthogonal to the f axis and crossing the proline ring preferentially occupies the semicircle (grey) away from the proline ring (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">methods</xref>).</p>

<title>Only distant structural homologs are available for a large fraction of human transmembrane helical proteins</title>
<p>To assess the significance of our technique developed to model membrane proteins from distant homologs, we analyzed the space of structural homologs available to all human TMH proteins using HHpred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Soding1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Soding2">[27]</xref>, a toolkit for searching and aligning query sequences with sequences from existing structures. The resultant HHpred alignments were filtered by a range of percent sequence identity thresholds (i.e. of homolog hit versus target) and percent coverages (i.e. of total length of target sequence) of 90%, 75%, 60% or 50%. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s001">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>, the percentage of human multi-pass TMH proteins sharing 15–25%, 25–35% and &gt;35% sequence identity with their best structural homolog hit is 43%, 12% and 12%, respectively. Similar distributions were obtained for datasets including also human single-pass TMH proteins or consisting of human multi-pass TMH proteins truncated to their TM domains (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>,D</bold>). These results indicate that only distant structural homologs are currently available for a large fraction of human TMH proteins. Moreover, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s001">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>, only one single distant structural homolog is found for a large fraction of these TMH proteins. These results justify our approach and led us to test our technique on a benchmark where membrane protein structures were primarily modeled from single distant structural homologs.</p>

<title>Submitted models of the adenosine receptor (A2AR) and chemokine receptor (CXCR4) were first-ranked in blind prediction GPCR-DOCK contests in the receptor structure accuracy category</title>
<p>The technique was tested in two challenging blind predictions of membrane receptor structures, i.e. GPCR-DOCK 2008 for the adenosine receptor (A2AR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Michino1">[15]</xref> and GPCR-DOCK 2010 for the chemokine receptor (CXCR4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Kufareva1">[14]</xref>. The closest homolog template to A2AR was the beta 1 adrenergic (B1AR) receptor structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Warne1">[28]</xref> sharing 32% sequence identity and exhibiting excellent sequence alignment in the TM region with A2AR. Therefore, TMH remodeling of the template structure was not required. A total of 206 models were submitted by the participants but very few showed significant improvements compared to the initial template structure. Among the top 10 models for both receptor and ligand binding prediction accuracy, one of our submitted models ranked co-first and first for the receptor prediction accuracy over the full length (i.e. 283 residues) and TMH region (i.e. 214 residues), respectively (the reported model from Costanzi had a lower “full-length” RMSD but did not include the entire long ECL2 loop, see Table 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Michino1">[15]</xref>). An additional model submitted without ligand (submission 3600_8, Supplementary information in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Michino1">[15]</xref>) was even closer to the target (Cα RMSD of 2.9 Å over 283 residues) and ranked first among all submitted models for both TMH and full-length structures with a Z-score of 1.51. For CXCR4, although HHpred identified the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) as the best aligned structural homolog, B2AR is a distant homolog sharing only 22% sequence identity with CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Cherezov1">[29]</xref> and its second TMH did not align well with the target near a proline-inducing kink. The C-terminal part of TMH2 starting from the kink and the loop structures were therefore remodeled, and 5 low-energy models with docked ligand were submitted. One model was ranked first for the accuracy of the receptor structure among all the 158 models submitted by the participants for the two CXCR4 structures (Z-score = 1.72) and 2 additional ones were ranked second and third for the prediction accuracy of the CXCR4/IT1t structure (Z-scores of 1.36 and 1.24) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Kufareva1">[14]</xref>. Both blind predictions demonstrate that our technique significantly improved starting templates and generated models exhibiting several structural features closer to the target X-ray structures than to the starting template. For example, the TMH shifts in the A2AR structure from B1AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>), the local kink in TMH2 of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A–C</bold></xref>) and the 27 residues long extracellular loop 3 of CXCR4 (residues G220-I246) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>) were predicted quite accurately. Although the conformation of the 16 residues long partially disordered extracellular loop 2 (residues A174-E179, R183- N192) was not predicted with near-atomic accuracy, its conformation was closer to the target CXCR4 than to the starting template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g004"><bold>Fig. 4F</bold></xref>) and was the most accurate prediction for that region among all submitted models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Kufareva1">[14]</xref>. We also attempted the modeling of D3DR but, since close homologs (sequence identity &gt;30%) were available, the main interest for this target was not receptor modeling but ligand docking which is outside the scope of the present study. With a Z-score of 0.41, our best model of D3DR ranked within the top 35% of the population of models. However, the accuracy of the models may not reflect the ability of our method to model the receptor because the ICL3 loop was mistakenly not rebuilt (i.e. the polypeptide chain was not connected between TMH5 and TMH6 due to the presence of T4 lysozyme in the B2AR template), preventing an optimal all-atom refinement of the receptor structure.</p>

<title>Starting templates are significantly improved in a benchmark dominated by distant homolog membrane protein structure pairs</title>
<p>To further test whether our method consistently improves homolog templates, we selected a representative dataset of 50 membrane protein structure pairs exhibiting a wide diversity of sequence identity (from 15% to 70%), length (from 183 to 420 residues and topology (from 5 to 12 TMHs) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>).

<p>The absence of improvements in the TMH regions was observed for 3 close homolog pairs: 3PBL from 3EML, 4EJ4 from 3RZE and 2IC8 from 2NR9. For 3PBL from 3EML, the template is already very close to the target structure (Cα RMSD = 1.1 Å). At this level of structural similarity, inaccuracies in the energy function and the lack of explicit modeling of buried water molecules, lipids and ligands in the current method may impede further significant improvements.</p>

<p>Modeling the unusually distorted TMH2 of squid rhodopsin (2Z73) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Murakami1">[35]</xref> was challenging. Proline 90 perturbs and partially breaks the hydrogen bond network between the backbone nitrogen and carbonyl groups of residues 85 to 90 which form a wide π turn splitting TMH2 in two helical fragments. In addition to the wide π turn, the relative position of these helical fragments is also unusual. Unlike many kinked helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Meruelo1">[21]</xref>, the interhelical (kink) angle is only 21 degrees and the C-terminal helix is displaced outside of the TMH core compared to the N-terminal helix, a conformation stabilized by the beta-strand forming an extracellular “lid” over the retinal binding site. In absence of this loop region during TMH rebuilding, the native conformation of the C-terminal helix is not stabilized by a large number of physical contacts with the rest of the TMH core making the selection of that conformation difficult by energy alone. Although our protocol improved starting templates overall, we expect that rebuilding TMH core and loop regions simultaneously may become a more effective strategy for helical conformation stabilized by loop regions and will be explored in future work.</p>

<title>The largest improvements are mainly observed for the most distant homolog templates</title>
<p>The largest improvements in full length structure and TMH regions (defined as GDT-HA increases ≥0.12) were mainly observed for distant homologues and include both GPCRs and non-GPCRs: 1U19 from 3ODU, 2RH1 from 1U19, 2CFQ from 2GFP and 3P5N from 3RLB. GDT-HA increases ≥0.12 in the TMH region were also mainly observed for distant homologs, such as 1U19 from 2Z73 or 3EML, 2RH1 from 2Z73 or 3ODU, 2Z73 from 3ODU, 3PBL from 3ODU, 3V2Y from 3RZE, 3EML from 3UON, 1U7G from 3B9W, 3P5N from 4DVE, 3V5U from 4KPP and 3GD8 from 3KLY.</p>
<p>Within the GPCR targets, modeling the beta2 adrenergic receptor (2RH1) from bovine rhodopsin (1U19) led to the largest improvements in GDT-HA: 0.13 and 0.19 over the full-length and TM structures, respectively. Although these 2 GPCRs share only 20% sequence identity in the modeled regions, 73% of the model residues lie within 1 Å of the native TM structures compared to only 28% for the starting template and display very similar side-chain conformations compared to in the native structure (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B,C</bold></xref>). Most of the residues not predicted at atomic resolution belong to the extracellular part of the first TMH which, unlike in 1U19, is poorly packed to the rest of the TM structure in the B2AR crystal structure and is difficult to predict accurately.</p>
<p>Within the non-GPCR targets, the largest improvements in GDT-HA were observed for the ECF-type riboflavin transporter (3P5N) from thiamine-specific S-component ThiT from an ECF-type ABC transporter (3RLB). Although these 2 transporters share only 15% sequence identity in the modeled regions, the overall fold is conserved. Three TMHs poorly aligned with the template were rebuilt leading to 0.14 and 0.16 improvements in GDT-HA over the full-length and TM structures, respectively. In contrast to the template, most of the TMH region in the selected Rosetta model is superimposable to that of the target allowing a large fraction of side-chains to adopt similar packing than in the native structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g002"><bold>Fig. 2F</bold></xref>). Similar improvements of starting templates leading to close to atomic accuracy backbone and near-native side-chain conformation predictions in the TM region were observed for other distant homolog pairs such as 2RH1 from CXCR4 (Cα RMSD of 1.7 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>) and 1U7G from 3B9W (Cα RMSD of 1.1 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g002"><bold>Fig. 2E</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Although most of the largest improvements were obtained for distant homologs, the method was also able to improve starting templates for most of the closer homolog pairs that are structurally more similar. For example, improvements in GDT-HA ≥0.1 were observed for the pairs 1U19 from 2Z73, 2Z73 from 1U19, 1J4N from 1FX8, and 1L7V from 2NQ2 sharing more than 25% sequence identity in the modeled regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>). In the latter, reconstruction of distorted TMHs with different kink patterns between target and template allowed accurate prediction of backbone and side-chain conformations in the TM region (Cα RMSD of 1.1 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g002"><bold>Fig. 2G</bold></xref>).</p>

<title><italic>De novo</italic> prediction of loop structures</title>
<p>When loop sequences are well aligned between template and target, their structures from the template are, as for TM regions, accurately refined at all-atom. In absence of significant sequence alignment with the template, loops are rebuilt <italic>de novo</italic> from sequence and accurately predicting their structures remains a challenge in the field of protein modeling. Three scenarios are typically encountered: 1) When loops are short (typically &lt;8 residues) (e.g. kinks in distorted TMHs) or 2) When loops are long (typically ≥8 residues) but not only composed of disordered segments (i.e. incorporating a significant fraction of secondary structure elements), our approach can rebuild these regions from sequence with near-atomic accuracy (Cα RMSD within 2.5 Å). Examples include the blind-predicted extracellular loop 3 of CXCR4 (residues G220-I246) and the blind-predicted intracellular loop 2 of DRD3 (residues V109-T118) as well as several GPCR and non-GPCR loops in our benchmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A–E</bold></xref>). 3) Loops such as the extracellular loop 2 of GPCRs can be long and mostly disordered and/or make numerous contacts with small molecules or with other subunits in the crystal structures. Because crystal contacts or ligands are not modeled by the current method, near-native conformations of loops stabilized by such contacts are very difficult to select by energy alone. Therefore, although our blind predicted model of the long disordered extracellular loop 2 of CXCR4 was significantly more accurate than any other submitted model in the blind prediction, future developments (e.g. integrated loop modeling and ligand docking) will be necessary to consistently reach high-accuracy prediction in these regions and allow accurate prediction of ligand-bound conformations. Nevertheless, our results suggest that our method should be useful in rebuilding and refining X-ray structures of membrane receptors where functionally important loop regions have missing densities or are often deleted to facilitate crystallization.</p>

<title>Selected models are of suitable accuracy for rational design applications</title>
<p>An important question in the field of protein modeling is the relationship between the accuracy of the models and their potential applications. Near-atomic resolution models should be accurate enough to guide the rational design of mutations and the interpretation of their effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Baker1">[4]</xref>. As a stringent test of the accuracy of our predictions, we subjected the selected models from our benchmark to complete sequence redesign in the TMH regions and compared the results to similar calculations performed with the native X-ray and initial template structures (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>). Single-state design calculations select combinations of amino acids that minimize the free energy of (i.e. predicted to stabilize) the protein. Previous sequence calculations performed on high-resolution transmembrane helical protein X-ray structures recapitulated a significant fraction of native sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth2">[24]</xref>, suggesting that this fraction of residues is naturally selected for stability. Because the physical interactions underlying the selection of amino acids are very sensitive to the atomic details of the structure, the level of native amino acid recovery should be indicative of the accuracy of the protein structure. While redesigned template structures recovered only 23±6% of native amino acid sequences, redesigned X-ray and selected model structures recovered 35±10% and 42±8% of native amino acid sequences, respectively. Only 41±13% of the native residues recovered in redesigned templates were also recovered in redesigned X-ray structures. By contrast, 72±7% of the native residues recovered in redesigned selected models were also recovered in redesigned X-ray structures. These results indicate that the native interactions recovered in redesigned X-ray and selected model structures are similar, and suggest that the TMH regions of protein models generated using our method are in a range of accuracy suitable for rational design applications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The prediction of membrane protein structures represents an important approach in light of their difficult experimental determination but remains a challenging problem. Current prediction techniques are limited to the generation of low-resolution models from sequence information alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Hopf1">[12]</xref> or of near-atomic resolution models from close structural homologues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Forrest1">[5]</xref>. However, close structural homologs are currently not available for a large fraction of membrane proteins and often only one distant structural homolog hit can be found for these proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>), making their structure prediction at high-resolution a real challenge. To address this problem, we developed a generic method that can efficiently reconstruct TMH and loop regions from single distant or closer homologues. The method was stringently validated in two blind predictions and in a large benchmark consisting of pairs of membrane protein homologues with wide diversity in length, topology and sequence identity. Submitted models were first-ranked in the blind predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Kufareva1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Michino1">[15]</xref> for the accuracy of the full-length receptor structure and the method was able to improve most starting templates in the benchmark to reach near atomic accuracy prediction in the TMH regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>). In local regions of the TMH structures where distortions differed between template and target, the method was able to significantly improve the starting template and to predict distorted helical structures with an average Cα RMSD of only 0.8 Å to the native structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s003">Table S2</xref></bold>). As a stringent proof of the model's accuracy, complete redesign of their TMH regions recapitulated similar native interactions than the redesign of the same regions in the X-ray structures. In contrast, the methods MEDELLER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Kelm1">[30]</xref>, a comparative modeling technique developed for membrane proteins, the widely used homology modeling software MODELLER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Eswar1">[31]</xref>, and I-TASSER, a web-server for protein structure prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Roy1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Zhang2">[33]</xref>, did not significantly improve homologous templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The improvements observed for most distant or closer homologues with diverse length and topology indicate that the method provides a general and efficient approach for reconstructing the structure of a large diversity of transmembrane helical folds. Starting templates with sequence identity to the target as low as 15% were significantly improved, suggesting that the technique should be effective at generating atomic-level models more accurate than available templates for many structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003636.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Because the conformational heterogeneity and poor stability of eukaryotic membrane proteins in detergents is a major bottleneck to their crystallization, their stabilization has been a very intensive area of research but has only been achieved with limited success using labor-intensive cycles of random or scanning mutagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Sarkar1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Zhou1">[38]</xref>. According to our design calculations, our technique can predict stabilizing physical interactions in structurally uncharacterized receptors and should therefore be particularly useful for predicting mutational effects on receptor's conformational stability, for engineering receptors with altered conformational energy landscape and for precisely guiding structure/function studies.</p>
<p>Future developments will involve 1) the explicit modeling of water molecules to improve the prediction of TMH core regions, and 2) the simultaneous modeling of loop and bound ligand conformations to improve the prediction of loop structures and allow accurate prediction of receptor-ligand bound conformations and interactions for ligand docking and virtual screening applications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the method may prove useful for the atom-level modeling and design of structurally uncharacterized classes of alpha-helical membrane receptors which are particularly challenging to study experimentally and for which close homologues are currently often not available.</p>

<title>Selection of modeling targets from the Orientation of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Lomize1">[44]</xref></title>
<p>Membrane protein targets were selected by filtering the OPM database with the following criteria that reflect the current scope of the method. Firstly, selecting for “transmembrane” and “alpha-helical polytopic”, 936 proteins in 75 superfamilies were identified. Next, families were removed that 1) have less than two unique protein structures (need at least one homolog) –or– 2) consist of multi-protein complexes –or– 3) consist of very large proteins (&gt;15 secondary structure elements or &gt;600 residues) –or– 4) contain large cofactors (e.g. heme groups) –or– 5) formed from many symmetrical subunits. This reduced the number of superfamilies to 18. Additionally, four of the remaining superfamilies did not contain proteins with structurally characterized homologs with sequence identity &gt;15% and were also removed. The remaining 14 superfamilies are the following (as categorized by OPM database): 1) Rhodopsin-like receptors and pumps, 2) ABC transporters, 3) General secretory pathway, 4) Major Intrinsic Protein, 5) Ammonia and urea transporters, 6) Major Facilitator Superfamily, 7) APC (Amino acid-Polyamine-organoCation) superfamily, 8) Monovalent cation-proton antiporter, 9) Chloride transporter, 10) Multidrug/Oligosaccharidyl-lipid superfamily, 11) Energy-coupling factor transporters, 12) Rhomboid protease, 13) Sodium/calcium exchanger, and 14) Peptidase family M48. Our dataset of modeling targets covers 12 of 14 superfamilies. The available target/template homologs for the Monovalent cation-proton antiporters and the Peptidase family M48 are too distant (structural alignment between template and target is extremely poor: Calpha rmsd = 25 Å) and too homologous (38% identity), respectively, to be considered relevant for this study. In total we selected 50 representative modeling cases combining different target/template pairs, and 31 unique targets. Of our modeling targets, 12 are GPCRs (11 Class A and 1 Class B) and 19 are non-GPCRs membrane proteins.</p>

<title>Sequence alignment between target and templates</title>
<p>Several methods including the consensus method 3D-Jury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Ginalski1">[45]</xref> and HHpred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Soding1">[25]</xref> based on HMM-HMM comparisons were tested to generate optimal sequence-sequence alignments. HHpred gave the best alignments in our benchmark and was subsequently used for all predictions. The following parameters were used: ten PSI-BLAST iterations with an E-value threshold of 1E-3, local alignment with global final realignment. For the blind predictions, the best alignment was systematically considered to select homologues and construct templates. For a few of the most distant pairs (3L1L from 3GIA, 2CFQ from 2GPF, 3P5N from 4DVE, 3GIA from 4DJK, 2GPF from 2CFQ, 3KLY from 3GD8, 3GD8 from 3KLY, 3HD6 from 1U7G, 3VVO from 3MKT and 4HZU from 3RLB), the sequence alignment generated by HHpred was adjusted manually, guided by topology prediction of TMHs given by Octopus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Viklund1">[46]</xref> and secondary structure prediction given by Psipred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Jones1">[43]</xref>, to improve the alignment of the TMH region and minimize the number gaps or insertions in this region.</p>

Therefore, all models generated by MEDELLER were checked for loops that incorporated fragments from the target structure.

<title>Rebuilding-and-Refinement protocol</title>
<p>The method consists of three parts: <bold>1.</bold> Rebuilding of TMH structures, <bold>2.</bold> Rebuilding of non-TMH (e.g. loops, helical bends) structures, <bold>3.</bold> All-atom refinement of reconstructed structures.</p>
<p><bold>1.</bold> Rebuilding of TMH structures is performed if 1) gaps in the sequence alignment occur in these regions, 2) bends have different predicted positions (e.g. unaligned Prolines or coil motifs, non-conservation of Prolines between template and target sequences) or 3) TMHs have different predicted lengths (i.e. significantly different secondary structure prediction) indicating potential different tilt angles with regards to the membrane plane. Concerning the prediction of residues promoting helical bends, we limited ourselves to the presence of prolines in the target or in 10% of the homolog sequences which, depending on the membrane protein structure databases analyzed, account for between 60% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Meruelo1">[21]</xref> and 90% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Yohannan1">[18]</xref> of TMH kinks. Sequence motifs other than prolines have been reported to induce helical bends but current sequence-based predictions do not exhibit a combined sensivity/specificity high enough to be used as an automated input in the rebuilding of TMHs. Even if they cannot be identified by sequence or secondary structure information alone, helical bends and distortions promoted by local strain in the backbone structure or by specific tertiary interactions can still be identified and modeled during the all-atom structure refinement stage.</p>
<p>Rigid-body helical degrees of freedom of TMHs to be rebuilt are sampled based on a kinematic description of the polypeptide chain where the protein system is represented in internal coordinates by a tree of atoms which can have any structure provided there is no closed loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Bradley1">[47]</xref>. The atom-tree representation was further developed so that the edges in the tree can be any bond connections or rigid body transformations, making the protein a single continuous bonded chain or multiple domains connected by virtual long-range “jumps” between residues. This new atom-tree representation allows torsional and rotameric sampling within each individual TMH segment as well as perturbations in the rigid body degrees of freedom around the “jump” connecting these segments. Loops and local distorted regions connecting full-length or fragments of TMHs to be rebuilt are stripped out from the template and alternative TMH conformations are generated by randomly sampling rigid body degrees of freedom along and off the helical axis. At this stage, the protein template is represented at the coarse-grained level where side-chain conformations are averaged out, thereby drastically decreasing the number of degrees of freedom to be sampled. Moves are accepted using a Metropolis Monte-Carlo criterion (1000 to 5000 steps for each TMH fragment constrained by a Gaussian function to 1–1.5 Å of the starting structure) and followed by loop rebuilding and full structure gradient-based minimization (see below).</p>
<p>More specifically, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>, kinked TMHs are represented by two TMH fragments and a distorted helical turn around the kink. Each helix fragment is treated as a rigid-body and defined by a helical axis (m for “moveable” and f for “fixed” defining the reference state). Following the distribution of kink angles and distances between TMH fragments of kinked TMHs in membrane protein structures, the two TMH fragments adopt relative orientations that are constrained in space. The m helix is moved with regard to the f helix according to the following degrees of freedom:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>A translation is applied to the m helix moving its C-terminus to a random point on the surface of a hemisphere originating at the N-terminal of the fixed helix, with a gaussian radius equal to 7.2±0.6 Å (only +z-axis translation is allowed) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth2">[24]</xref>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>A rotation is applied to the m helix. The rotation is to a random vector restricted to the +z, and +x quadrants (−x being defined as the vector between the m helix C-terminus and the Carbon Beta (CB) atom of the f helix N-terminal residue, e.g. proline). These moves ensure that the projection of the N-terminus of the m helix on a plane orthogonal to the f axis and crossing the proline ring preferentially occupies the semicircle away from the proline ring as observed in kinked TMH native structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003636-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Riek1">[23]</xref>.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>In addition to these constrained moves, each TMH fragment is allowed to spin around its helical axis. Finally, the f and m helices are also allowed to move as a single unit and to sample the conformational degrees of freedom of a standard alpha helix rigid body.</p>
<p><bold>2.</bold> Non-TMH (e.g. loops, helical bends) structures with low sequence identity to the template or exhibiting gaps/deletions in the sequence alignment with the template are rebuilt de novo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth1">[10]</xref>. This step follows the previously developed de novo folding protocol for membrane protein structures and involves random peptide fragment insertions subjected to acceptation by the Metropolis criteria based on the total energy of the system. At this stage, the system is still represented at the coarse-grained level and the low-resolution energy function of Rosetta is used to compute the energy of the system. Cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) is used to close the chain break in the rebuilt region and to maintain the connectivity of the protein chain, and is achieved by iteratively inserting fragments and increasing the chain break penalty. If after twelve rebuilding steps, any chain break remains larger than 0.2 Å, the region to be rebuilt is expanded by one residue on both sides until a continuous peptide chain is recovered. The libraries of fragments to be inserted are generated for fragments of size 9 and 3. Fragments of larger size were tested but didn't provide any significant improvements in the accuracy of the rebuilt regions.</p>
<p>Helical bends in kinked TMHs are typically modeled as four residues loop insertion connecting two helical fragments and can sometime result in distorted loop conformations which are not usually observed in native kinked helices. Such local structures involve either a combination of non-helical turns and 3<sub>10</sub> helix or helical distortions extending 2 or 3 residues Cterminal to the residue responsible for the bend. In such situation, starting from the selected all-atom refined model, a larger window of residue (e.g. 5 to 8) is rebuilt and locally refined using the loop modeling protocol.</p>
<p><bold>3.</bold> The fragment insertion protocol described above involves fragment insertion moves that sample a large conformational space to identify a broad range of physically-realistic conformations. The coarse-grained models are then subjected to all-atom refinement which searches the all-atom conformational energy landscape for local minima in the vicinity of these structures. This step combines an all-atom energy function developed for transmembrane protein structures with an efficient search for low-energy conformations. As described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Barth2">[24]</xref>, the energy function mainly consists of short-range interactions, e.g. Lennard-Jones, hydrogen-bond. Knowledge-based potentials describe torsional states of both backbone and side-chain atoms and the solvation energy of each atom as a function of both its depth in the membrane and its burial in the protein. A Monte-Carlo minimization procedure with discrete side-chain optimization is used to efficiently sample low-energy conformations in the rugged all-atom energy landscape. A single move involves the following steps: 1) random backbone perturbations, 2) discrete side-chain optimization for the new backbone conformation, 3) minimization of the energy of the system with respect to all conformational degrees of freedom. Several cycles of small backbone perturbations are first applied to the entire receptor starting with a smooth Lennard-Jones potential followed by an iterative ramping up of the repulsive part of the potential. This procedure allows a smooth transition from a coarse-grained to a full-atom representation without loosing the compactness of the initial structures.</p>
<p>To avoid the sampling of conformational space unlikely occupied by the target sequence, the all-atom energy function is also supplemented by a constraint potential maintaining conserved regions that are in vicinity in the template structures. These constraints are defined between pairs of strictly conserved or similar residues in both target and template sequences and that are in vicinity in the template structures. In our calculations, a constraint is defined by a distance between the Cα atoms of the interacting residue pairs and a constraint width (i.e. the deviation from the assigned distance at which the constraint score begins to ramp up). Any deviation from these distances during refinement is penalized by a harmonic potential. Small constraint widths were assigned for short-range contacts (e.g. 0.2 Å for contacts ≤5 Å) while larger constraint widths were assigned for longer-range constraints (e.g. 0.5 Å for contacts of ∼8 Å). To avoid over constraining the models to the starting template, the average number of selected constraints was around 5% of the total number of residues for the most distant homolog pairs (i.e. sequence identity of 15–20%) and between 5% and 10% for intermediate homolog pairs (i.e. sequence identity of 20–25%). For closer homolog pairs (i.e. sequence identity &gt;25%), models were highly constrained to the starting templates at most positions not rebuild <italic>de novo</italic>.</p>

<title>Selection of models</title>
<p>Between 10000 and 40000 all-atom refined models are generated per target. 1000 or up to 10% lowest energy structures are selected and their transmembrane region clustered into structurally-related families using Rosetta's clustering protocol. The most accurate model among the five lowest-energy structures which cluster in one of the five largest families of models is selected and discussed in this study. Accuracy of the models to the target structure is computed using TM-SCORE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Zhang3">[48]</xref> over full length and TM regions.</p>

Briefly, the backbone coordinates from the X-ray structure, the selected model and the initial template were selected to perform the design calculations. All 20 amino acids were allowed at the TMH positions and the native residues were kept in the loop regions. The combination of amino acids and side-chain conformations minimizing the free energy of the system was selected by Monte Carlo sampling of discrete side-chain conformations (i.e. rotamers) followed by energy minimization over all conformational degrees of freedom. The Dunbrack rotamer library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003636-Dunbrack1">[50]</xref> expanded by rotamers at +−1 standard deviation around the mean values for the dihedral angles chi1 and chi2 was used to repack the structures.
