<abstract>
<p>The organization of cells, emerging from cell–cell interactions, can give rise to collective properties. These properties are adaptive when together cells can face environmental challenges that they separately cannot. One particular challenge that is important for microorganisms is migration. In this study, we show how flagellum-independent migration is driven by the division of labor of two cell types that appear during <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> sliding motility. Cell collectives organize themselves into bundles (called “van Gogh bundles”) of tightly aligned cell chains that form filamentous loops at the colony edge. We show, by time-course microscopy, that these loops migrate by pushing themselves away from the colony. The formation of van Gogh bundles depends critically on the synergistic interaction of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. We propose that surfactin-producing cells reduce the friction between cells and their substrate, thereby facilitating matrix-producing cells to form bundles. The folding properties of these bundles determine the rate of colony expansion. Our study illustrates how the simple organization of cells within a community can yield a strong ecological advantage. This is a key factor underlying the diverse origins of multicellularity.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Some problems can be solved only when individuals act together. This applies to bacteria in the same way that it applies to humans. Here we study how bacteria overcome the environmental challenge of migration over a solid surface by bundling their forces. Migration can be a significant environmental challenge for bacteria, especially when food sources are distributed far apart and have to be reached by movement along a solid surface, where swimming motility does not work. We show that <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>—a common inhabitant of the soil—migrates over a solid surface by forming multicellular structures. Migration depends on the synergistic interaction of two cell types: surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. Surfactin-producing cells facilitate migration by reducing the friction between cells and their substrate, thereby allowing matrix-producing cells to organize themselves into bundles that form filamentous loops at the colony edge. Using time-course microscopy, we observe that the filamentous loops drive migration by pushing themselves away from the colony. A mathematical model further shows that the folding properties of these loops are critical for the rate of colony expansion. Thus, not only do cells act together to overcome the challenge of migration, they also divide labor, in that different cell types specialize on distinct tasks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many properties of biological systems come about through the interactions of the parts that compose such systems. These so-called collective properties are said to “emerge” from these interactions, because they cannot be produced by the parts separately [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The most remarkable collective properties are found in multicellular organisms, where cell–cell interactions result in a bewildering diversity of forms and functions that cannot be generated by the cells in isolation [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cell differentiation is an important factor underlying this diversity [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cell types that differ in their adhesive properties, motility, or shape interact with each other and thereby guide developmental change [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When a collective property is adaptive, cell types that give rise to this property can be favored by selection [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The evolution of cell differentiation and collective properties can therefore go hand in hand [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Collective properties are often studied in species where cells can live independently, but often choose not to. These species are ideal for studying why and when cells form collectives and how these collectives come about. One of the most remarkable examples of such voluntary cell collectives comes from the soil-dwelling bacterium <italic>Myxoccocus xanthus</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During predation of other bacteria, thousands of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> cells coordinate their behavior to lyse and degrade prey [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When nutrient levels decrease, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> cells aggregate and assemble into a fruiting body filled with many thousands of spores [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The aerial projections of the fruiting body are thought to aid in spore dispersal [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Whereas it is a major challenge for individual cells to disperse, the cell collectives solve this problem by sticking out from the soil [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Dispersal is a major challenge for many soil-dwelling microorganisms. As a result, aerial spore-containing structures evolved independently in a number of bacterial and eukaryotic species, through the process of convergent evolution [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Another major challenge for soil-dwelling organisms is migration: how to get from one soil particle to the next. Without the possibility of swimming through liquid, cells have to find alternative ways to migrate [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These are often studied by examining colony growth patterns [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, <italic>Paenibacillus vortex</italic> migrates by making vortices that consist of millions of cells that swirl around over agar surfaces, producing beautiful fractal growth patterns [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A closely related species, <italic>Bacillus mycoides</italic>, forms chiral branching patterns that orient clockwise or counterclockwise while expanding over the agar surface [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A number of other species from the same bacterial families, Bacillaceae and Paenibacillaceae, have been studied as well with respect to colony growth patterns [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In all cases, cells solve the challenge of migration by migrating together. Yet how cells coordinate migration is often unknown: which cell types drive migration and how do they interact? This lack of knowledge is partly because little is known about the cell types that are expressed during colony growth. Interestingly, one species from the Bacillaceae family, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, produces a number of different cell types and has been intensely studied with respect to cell differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The phenotypes of these cell types are well characterized [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> therefore is the ideal species to examine if and how different cell types guide the migration of cell collectives. Furthermore, it gives a unique opportunity to examine how adaptations at the cell level relate to the collective properties that emerge from them.</p>
<p><italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> can express at least five distinct cell types, which are often studied in the context of biofilm formation. Each of these cell types is associated with a unique set of phenotypes: motility, surfactin production, matrix production, protease production, and sporulation [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Motile cells synthesize flagella that can be used for swimming. Surfactin-producing cells secrete surfactin, a surfactant that reduces water surface tension [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], functions as a communication signal [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and acts as an antimicrobial [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Matrix-producing cells secrete an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) and the structural protein TasA [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. EPS acts as a “glue” that surrounds cells inhabiting the biofilm. In addition, colony wrinkling requires EPS, and under some conditions, colony expansion also depends on EPS [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. TasA assembles into amyloid-like fibers that attach to the cell wall and, like EPS, is required for colony wrinkling [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Since <italic>tasA</italic> and <italic>eps</italic> mutants complement each other when cocultured, TasA and EPS are considered common goods that are shared between cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition to EPS and TasA, matrix-producing cells secrete antimicrobial compounds that can kill sibling cells and other soil-dwelling organisms [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Protease-producing cells secrete proteases that facilitate nutrient acquisition [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Finally, cells can differentiate into spores: stress-resistant cells that can survive long periods of desiccation and nutrient limitation [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The regulatory mechanisms underlying cell differentiation in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> are well-characterized [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, most cell types have been associated with some colony-level properties, although a detailed causal relation is often lacking [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we study how cell differentiation affects the migration of cell collectives during <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> colony expansion via sliding motility. We grow bacteria on a specific medium that prevents cells from swimming and swarming (which both rely on flagella), but still allows for colony expansion. In this way, we can examine whether colony expansion depends on cell differentiation, and if so, how the interactions between cell types drive migration. We show that migration depends critically on two cell types: surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. Together they drive migration through a mechanism in which cell collectives form highly organized bundles at the colony edge, which we have termed “van Gogh bundles.” Van Gogh bundles are formed from many tightly aligned filaments consisting of chains of cells. They appear elastic and fold into filamentous loops that push themselves away from the colony. Surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells divide labor during the formation of van Gogh bundles. We propose that surfactin-producing cells reduce the friction between cells and their substrate, which facilitates formation of the van Gogh bundles by the matrix-producing cells. Whereas EPS production is necessary for the formation of these bundles, TasA seems to fine-tune their biophysical properties. Finally, as a complement to the experiments, a mathematical model illustrates how simple cellular properties can affect a bundle’s folding properties and hence the migration rate.</p>

<title>Cell Types That Control Colony Expansion</title>
<p>We studied migration by examining colony growth on MSggN [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. MSggN is a growth medium that induces colony expansion and resembles the biofilm-inducing medium, MSgg, that is typically used to study cell differentiation in the context of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> biofilms [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Colony expansion is more apparent on MSggN than on MSgg, which makes the former more suitable for studying migration (see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Colony growth on MSggN consists of two main phases that are morphologically distinct (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>; see also [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]). First, the colony forms dendrites that spread radially from the inoculum. Second, phenotypically distinct outgrowths, which we call “petals,” appear at the end of the dendrites. In some instances the petals change into another morphological structure at the colony edge, which we call “rays.” The distinct growth phases do not result from genetic change, because cells from the morphologically distinct regions of the colony behave the same as wild type (WT) when re-inoculated onto a fresh growth medium (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine which cell types are involved in colony expansion we tested mutants deficient in the production of surfactin (<italic>srfA</italic> mutant), extracellular matrix (<italic>eps</italic> and <italic>tasA</italic> mutants), spores (<italic>sigF</italic> mutant), and flagella (<italic>hag</italic> mutant). Both surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells were necessary for colony expansion, whereas motility and sporulation mutants showed a nearly WT colony expansion (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We examined two matrix-related mutants: <italic>eps</italic> and <italic>tasA</italic>. While the <italic>eps</italic> mutant did not show any degree of colony expansion, <italic>tasA</italic> mutants did expand beyond the colony boundaries present at inoculation, although the expansion was much less than that of WT (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). These results are in agreement with previous studies that showed that <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> colony expansion on MSggN is independent of flagellum formation, but requires surfactin production [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, our experiment showed that matrix-producing cells are also required for colony expansion.</p>

<title>Colony Expansion in Chimeric Colonies</title>
<p>To examine whether colony expansion could be recovered by extracellular complementation, different pairs of expansion-deficient mutants were cocultured as chimeric colonies [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Such two-mutant cocultures can reveal something about the interactions between different cell types during colony growth [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. All examined chimeric colonies in which mutant cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio showed a partial to full recovery of colony expansion when compared to the WT (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Interestingly, two of the chimeric colonies appeared to outperform WT in the extent of colony expansion: <italic>srfA</italic> + <italic>eps</italic> and <italic>eps tasA</italic> + <italic>srfA</italic>. Thus, the task differentiation of matrix and surfactin production by mutant strains enhanced the degree of colony expansion.</p>

In chimeric colonies that contained many <italic>eps tasA</italic> mutant cells, there was little colony expansion (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, 9:1 <italic>eps tasA</italic>:<italic>srfA</italic>), and in chimeric colonies with many <italic>srfA</italic> mutant cells, colonies expanded far (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, 1:9 <italic>eps tasA</italic>:<italic>srfA</italic>). In the <italic>eps tasA</italic> + <italic>srfA</italic> chimera, <italic>eps tasA</italic> mutant cells are responsible for surfactin production and <italic>srfA</italic> mutant cells are responsible for matrix production. Therefore, we conclude that the extent of colony expansion is mostly constrained by the number of cells that produce matrix: a small number of surfactin-producing cells is sufficient to fully restore colony expansion (see <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, 1:9 <italic>eps tasA</italic>:<italic>srfA</italic>), while a small number of matrix-producing cells is not (see <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, 9:1 <italic>eps tasA</italic>:<italic>srfA</italic>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined chimeric colonies of strains that were marked with different fluorescent reporters. This allowed us to determine how strains mixed in space when grown together. Interestingly, not all strain combinations mixed homogeneously. When strains differed in terms of matrix production, for example, in a chimera of a matrix-deficient mutant (<italic>eps tasA</italic>) and the WT strain, spatial segregation was observed (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). This directly affected colony expansion. Even though the WT strain has the potential to fully expand over the agar plate, it could not expand when strongly outnumbered by the matrix-deficient strain in the initial inoculum (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, 19:1 <italic>eps tasA</italic>:WT). This suggests that matrix-deficient cells prevent WT cells from migrating. Mutant cells might simply block WT cells by surrounding them at the colony edge (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Alternatively, in the presence of mutant cells, the appropriate environmental signals to trigger colony expansion might be lacking. When the fraction of WT cells in the inoculum increased (from left to right in <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), the WT could expand over the agar plate. In that case, both strains were found in the expanded section of the colony. Thus, in addition to matrix-producing cells facilitating colony expansion, matrix-deficient cells can inhibit colony expansion.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Temporal Expression Pattern of Surfactin-Producing and Matrix-Producing Cells</title>
<p>The chimeric colonies showed that colony expansion depends on the presence of both surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. In the next sections we examine how these cell types interact in the WT and consequently drive migration. To study surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells in a WT strain, we used a double-labeled strain in which the expression of two fluorescent reporters, genes coding for yellow (YFP) and cyan (CFP) fluorescent proteins, is under the control of the promoter for surfactin biosynthesis genes (P<sub><italic>srfA</italic></sub>) and the <italic>tasA</italic> operon promoter (P<sub><italic>tapA</italic></sub>), respectively [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, in the double-labeled strain, surfactin-producing cells express YFP, and matrix-producing cells express CFP.</p>
<p>First, we examined the temporal gene expression dynamics by performing a time-course experiment. Colonies were examined every 2 h for 12 h after inoculation, as well as at 24 h and 31 h after inoculation (Materials and Methods). Since the <italic>srfA</italic> promoter is very weakly expressed, it was impossible to detect using flow cytometry. Instead, direct microscopy was performed on the colony samples, which were first dispersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer to get a representative fraction of cells. At every time point, microscopy pictures were taken from a labeled WT strain (<italic>n</italic> = 20–50 microscopy images) and, as a control, an unlabeled WT strain (<italic>n</italic> = 10–30 microscopy images). Since it was impossible to accurately analyze all of the images manually (<italic>n</italic> = 439), a MatLab program was used to quickly select, process, and statistically analyze the images (see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> for details; [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]).</p>
<p><xref rid="pbio.1002141.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> shows the expression of <italic>srfA</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic> over time. The expression pattern is characterized by two phases: in the first phase there is a peak in the average expression of <italic>srfA</italic>, while in the second phase there is sharp increase in the average expression of <italic>tapA</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> shows a representative image from each of these two phases. At the onset of colony growth there is also a slight peak in <italic>tapA</italic> expression, which is due to background expression in the inoculation conditions (for details see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). When taking the time frame of gene expression into consideration, the up-regulation of <italic>srfA</italic> corresponds to dendrite formation, and the up-regulation of <italic>tapA</italic> corresponds to petal formation (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The distinct growth phases that are apparent at the macroscopic level therefore relate to gene expression dynamics at the cell level (microscopic). The same microscopy images were used to examine the co-expression of <italic>srfA</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic>. As expected from previous studies [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the expression of <italic>srfA</italic> and the expression of <italic>tapA</italic> were mutually exclusive (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). This confirmed that also for our growth conditions, surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells are mutually exclusive and distinct cell types (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Spatial Expression Pattern of Surfactin-Producing and Matrix-Producing Cells</title>
<p>Next we studied the spatial arrangement of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. Colonies were examined by cutting a piece of the agar at the colony edge. This agar piece was subsequently flipped onto a glass-bottom well, sandwiching the cells between the coverslip and an agar pad, and the cut piece of colony edge was subjected to a detailed microscopic examination (for details see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). The advantage of this technique is that intact cell collectives could be observed, as they would occur in growing colonies. Examining these cell collectives is particularly important because it might help in understanding how cells migrate during colony expansion. However, a disadvantage of the technique is that colonies can be examined only at the edge, where a monolayer of cells exists, which is necessary for accurate quantification of fluorescent images.</p>
<p>The colony edge was dissected at different time points ranging over two colony growth phases: dendrite formation (&lt;11–13 h) and petal formation (&gt;11–13 h) (summarized at the top of <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). During dendrite formation, cells aggregate into clumps. These clumps consist of matrix-producing cells (false-colored green) and are surrounded by surfactin-producing cells (false-colored red, <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). The clumps appear within a few hours after inoculation. Even when we made certain that there were no surfactin-producing or matrix-producing cells present in the inoculum (by performing a passaging experiment, see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) clumps formed rapidly. The clumps were relatively unorganized: the shape, size, and location varied strongly (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> shows one example). Although both surfactin producers and matrix producers are necessary for dendrite formation, as is evident from the mutant phenotypes (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), it is unclear if and how these clumps contribute to dendrite formation.</p>

<p>During the transition between the first growth phase (dendrite growth) and the second growth phase (formation of petal-shaped colony outgrowths at the tip of the dendrites) (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), a new type of aggregate appeared (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). As was observed for clumps, there was strong spatial segregation between surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells: matrix-producing cells occurred inside the bundle, whereas surfactin was expressed by cells surrounding the bundle. Interestingly, in contrast to aggregates in the first growth phase, the bundles appear organized. The bundles consist of many cellular filaments that are arranged side by side and are only a single cell layer thick. During the transition, the bundles seem to push themselves out of the colony edge (i.e., away from the single cells). The coordinated appearance of the bundles is even more striking at later time points. <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> show the colony edge after 34 h of colony growth.

<p>The organized appearance of van Gogh bundles results from a remarkably strong alignment of cells inside the bundles (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>). This is especially apparent when comparing the alignment of cells inside van Gogh bundles to the alignment of cells at the colony edge earlier in colony growth (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Figs). In fact, when considering only the alignment of cells, one can discriminate regions in a microscopy image that contain van Gogh bundles from regions that do not (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, van Gogh bundles appear flexible. When flipping the colony onto the glass-bottom well, the bundles sometimes folded (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), yet they hardly ever broke. Thus, adhesive forces between the cells must keep them aligned and attached such that shear forces or friction do not break them.</p>

<title>Van Gogh Bundles: EPS and TasA</title>
<p>In the chimeric colonies of strains with expansion-deficient mutations, described above, colony expansion was partly or fully recovered (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). From the previous section, one expects that the recovery of colony expansion results from the formation of van Gogh bundles. To test this, we examined the chimeric colonies using microscopy. Colonies were examined at the start of the second growth phase (i.e., the start of petal outgrowths), when both single cells and van Gogh bundles were expected to be present (see <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). The strains in the chimeric colonies were marked with fluorescent reporters, so that their spatial arrangement could be examined as well.</p>
<p><xref rid="pbio.1002141.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> shows that all chimeric colonies produced van Gogh bundles, although the bundles were not always as apparent as those in WT colonies (e.g., the <italic>eps</italic> + <italic>tasA</italic> chimera showed less apparent bundle formation). Thus, the recovery of colony expansion coincided with the emergence of van Gogh bundles during colony growth. In contrast, most mutants could not produce van Gogh bundles by themselves (see below). Interestingly, although both mutant strains were necessary for recovering the van Gogh bundles, not all cells became part of the van Gogh bundles. The fluorescent overlays show that the van Gogh bundles were made up of cells from the EPS-producing strains only. This is particularly apparent for the first and last mutant chimeras (e.g., <italic>srfA</italic> + <italic>eps</italic> and <italic>eps tasA</italic> + <italic>srfA</italic>), in which EPS-deficient cells never formed cell chains that were part of the van Gogh bundle (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In cases where both strains produced EPS, such as in the <italic>srfA</italic> + <italic>tasA</italic> chimera, van Gogh bundles did consist of cells from both strains, with the cell chains inside the van Gogh bundles belonging to either one of them. All in all, these results indicate that EPS is strictly required for the formation of van Gogh bundles, presumably for the adhesion between neighboring cell chains.</p>

<p>After evaluating the mutant chimeras, it is still unclear what the role of TasA is in the formation of van Gogh bundles. TasA was not strictly required for the formation of van Gogh bundles (see the <italic>eps</italic> + <italic>tasA</italic> chimera in <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Yet, the <italic>tasA</italic> mutant was partly impaired in colony expansion (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In order to evaluate the role of TasA, we examined the distribution of TasA protein directly by using a fusion of TasA and a red fluorescent protein (the fusion protein is designated TasA-mCherry). TasA-mCherry was examined by microscopy during the transition from the first to the second growth period. Previous studies suggested that TasA is freely shared between cells in the colony, since <italic>tasA</italic> mutants could be complemented when grown together with TasA-producing cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Interestingly, <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> shows that TasA was predominantly localized to the van Gogh bundles—where TasA is also produced—and only a limited fraction of TasA diffused to the surrounding single cells (see <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Text</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). In fact, TasA particularly localized to the “pole to pole” interactions between cells (see arrowheads in Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). Thus, in contrast to previous studies, our results suggest that there is only limited diffusion of TasA.</p>

<p>To examine whether TasA is shared between neighboring cells inside the van Gogh bundle, we examined a chimeric colony of TasA-mCherry + <italic>tasA</italic> mutant. Since the strain producing the fusion TasA-mCherry and the <italic>tasA</italic> mutant strain can form van Gogh bundles together (i.e., they both produce EPS), this chimera allows us to examine whether TasA produced by the TasA-mCherry strain is shared with the <italic>tasA</italic> mutant cells inside the van Gogh bundle (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Indeed, a small fraction of TasA diffused from the TasA-producing cells to the <italic>tasA</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). However, interestingly, there was no accumulation of TasA at the pole-to-pole interactions between <italic>tasA</italic> mutant cells (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref>). Thus, TasA accumulated only at the cell poles of TasA-producing cells inside the van Gogh bundle. It is plausible that a large fraction of the TasA produced by a WT cell localizes to its own poles.</p>
<p>In summary, van Gogh bundles are cell collectives that consist solely of matrix-producing cells but that require the presence of surfactin producers for their development. This is further confirmed by the fact that colony expansion in <italic>srfA</italic> mutants can be recovered by adding surfactin exogenously (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref>; [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]). The matrix-producing cells secrete EPS and TasA. While EPS is absolutely necessary for the formation of a van Gogh bundle, TasA seems to fine-tune the cell-to-cell interactions.</p>

<title>Van Gogh Bundles: Migration</title>
<p>In the previous sections we showed that colony expansion coincides with the formation of van Gogh bundles, which are formed when both surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells are present. Surfactin functions as a surfactant and facilitates colony expansion by reducing the friction between cells and their substrate [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The question, however, remains as to how the cell collectives that organize themselves in van Gogh bundles migrate in space. To address this question, we examined van Gogh bundles in more detail.</p>
<p>In order to analyze the structures that emerge at a larger spatial scale, we next imaged the van Gogh bundles at a lower magnification using a stereomicroscope. By using the stereomicroscope, no further manipulation of the colony was required, and growing colonies could be examined multiple times as growth progressed (the air objective does not disrupt the colony). Surprisingly, at lower magnification it became apparent that van Gogh bundles form large filamentous loops at the edge of the colony (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). These loops extend up to a few millimeters in length. We hypothesized that the van Gogh bundles migrate by simply pushing themselves away from the colony center as the filamentous loops grow. A time-lapse movie indeed confirmed our expectation (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Movie</xref>). Thus, colony expansion indeed emerges from the interaction of cells that organize themselves into van Gogh bundles.</p>

<p>The lack of colony expansion in sliding-deficient mutants, with the exception of <italic>tasA</italic>, can be explained by the lack of van Gogh bundles and the associated loops at the colony edge (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>).

Furthermore, the filamentous loops at the edge of the <italic>tasA</italic> colony are typically smaller and show more folds than those of the WT (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>). We hypothesize that TasA, although not strictly required for the formation of van Gogh bundles, may fine-tune the folding properties of the bundles. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that TasA localizes to the pole-to-pole contact points between cells in the van Gogh bundles, where it potentially affects biophysical properties such as the bending rigidity (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Interestingly, while the lack of TasA reduces colony expansion, the artificial overproduction of TasA does not enhance colony expansion (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Model of Filamentous Growth and Folding</title>
<p>Inspired by the folding differences between filamentous loops produced by the WT and those produced by <italic>tasA</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>), we wondered if and how cell-level properties (e.g., phenotype of a cell or cell–cell interactions) could affect the collective properties that we observed at the colony level. For this purpose, we constructed a simple phenomenological model. This model was not designed with the aim of quantitatively reproducing our experimental results, which at present is impossible given our limited knowledge of the biophysical properties of the van Gogh bundles. Rather, we aimed to illustrate how local cell interactions could shape colony-level properties. Previous models on multicellular development have shown that—through self-organization—simple cell-to-cell interactions can underlie complex properties that emerge at the organismal level [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Mathematical models are therefore a valuable tool to shape our intuition on the cell-level properties that are important for the qualitative patterns we observe at the colony level [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Inspired by models on epithelium folding [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], we modeled filaments of pole-to-pole-attached cells that grow in time (we ignored side-to-side attachment for simplicity). The model does not include the origin of filament formation, but instead examines filament growth. At every time step, cells can undergo one of three events: cell elongation, division, or turning (see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> for modeling details). Cell elongation occurs with a certain growth rate, taken from a uniform distribution, and can result in cell division when the cell length exceeds a certain threshold (i.e., the maximum cell length); in that case the mother cell divides into two equally long daughter cells. Cells can also turn and change their spatial orientation with respect to their neighbors. Cells turn only when the new orientation—determined by a random change in a cell’s angle with respect to its neighbors—is energetically favored compared to the cell’s original orientation. In the energetically preferred position, a cell is perfectly aligned with its neighbors (i.e., there is no angle between two neighboring cells). The chance that a cell turns depends on the bending rigidity (see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Cell elongation, division, and turning are local events that do not alter the spatial configuration of cells in other parts of the filament. Thus, the properties of the filament as a whole come about through the accumulation of local events.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>, these three simple cell-level behaviors are sufficient to produce expanding filamentous loops at the colony edge that look surprisingly similar to those observed in our experiments. Cell elongation and division result in undulations of the filaments (i.e., regions where the filaments bend slightly inwards or outwards). These undulations get smoothened as long as neighboring cells resist bending by strongly aligning with respect to each other (i.e., bending rigidity). However, when growth continues, the filament gets compressed and undulations increase. As a consequence, the filament starts folding. The folds turn into loops, which expand in space. As observed in the experimental results (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>), the model gives rise to bigger loops at the edge of the colony (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To examine how small changes at the cell level affect the expansion of filamentous loops, two modeling parameters were varied: the maximal cell length and the bending rigidity. These parameters correspond to properties that probably can be influenced by a cell. For example, we showed that cells inside van Gogh bundles are longer than their single-cell siblings (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>; two-sample <italic>t-</italic>test: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>, df = 184), which suggests that cells can alter the length at which they divide. In addition, we showed that van Gogh bundles show a particularly strong alignment (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>), which seems to partly depend on TasA that accumulates at the pole-to-pole interactions (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13</xref>). This indicates that cells can alter their bending rigidity with respect to neighboring cells. Interestingly, in the model, both longer cells and higher bending rigidities result in filaments that fold less (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>, conditions B and C). Longer cells reduce folding because there are fewer pole-to-pole interactions at which the filament could accumulate undulations. Likewise, when the bending rigidity is high, cells align more strongly, which results in less folding as well. The reduced tendency to fold increases the migration rate (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>, compare conditions A, B, and C).</p>
<p>Our phenomenological model thus illustrates how small changes at the cell level can shape the collective properties that emerge at the colony level. The collective properties we examined are the expanding filamentous loops that appear at the colony edge. One can imagine that evolution favors adaptations at the cell level, like a strong cell-to-cell alignment, that result in a higher migration rate of the filamentous loops.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we analyzed sliding motility in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> to determine the factors that allow for the collective migration of cells. We found that cells organize themselves into bundles that spread by forming expanding filamentous loops at the colony edge. These cell collectives, which we call van Gogh bundles, are distinct from previously described filaments in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> due to their strong alignment and functionality [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The folding properties of the filamentous loops determine the migration rate and, in part, depend on the products secreted by matrix-producing cells. The development and expansion of van Gogh bundles depend critically on the synergic interaction of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. To our knowledge, this is the first example of bacterial cells dividing labor in order to overcome one of the major ecological challenges: migration (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>).</p>

<title>Schematic overview of cell differentiation and collective properties in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> colony expansion.</title>
<p>Red and green cells represent, respectively, surfactin- and matrix-producing cells. Dendrites predominantly consist of surfactin-producing cells interspersed with clumps of matrix-producing cells. The petals of the colony consist predominantly of matrix-producing cells that form van Gogh bundles. We propose that surfactin mediates the expansion of van Gogh bundles by reducing the friction between the van Gogh bundles and substrate and that van Gogh bundle expansion is driven by cell division. The elastic and folding properties—dependent on matrix-producing cells—of the van Gogh bundles allow for an efficient colony expansion and prevent the bundles from breaking under increased compression.</p>

<p>We show that colony expansion is characterized by up-regulation of <italic>srfA</italic> expression (i.e., the surfactin-producing cell type) followed by an increase in <italic>tapA</italic> expression (i.e., the matrix-producing cell type). The two expression phases correspond to the two growth periods that are apparent at the macroscopic level: dendrite formation and petal-shaped colony outgrowth [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The temporal dynamics in gene expression correspond to the regulatory pathways controlling cell differentiation in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>. For example, <italic>srfA</italic> expression is regulated by quorum sensing [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]; at high cell density, the expression of <italic>srfA</italic> increases, which explains the gradual up-regulation of <italic>srfA</italic> at the onset of colony growth. In addition, surfactin can function as a signal that triggers matrix production [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that the peak in <italic>srfA</italic> expression is followed by a peak in <italic>tapA</italic> expression. This regulatory link between cell differentiation of surfactin-producing cells and matrix-producing cells corresponds closely to the functional link we describe in this study: van Gogh bundles, consisting of matrix-producing cells, can develop only in the presence of surfactin (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Thus, surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells divide labor in order to facilitate colony expansion (see also [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]). The division of labor typically evolves in response to strong phenotypic trade-offs [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. For example, cyanobacteria divide labor between photosynthetic cells and heterocysts, because photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation are incompatible [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Likewise, there might be a trade-off between the formation of van Gogh bundles by matrix-producing cells and the production of surfactin. Unfortunately, it is unclear what this trade-off might be; perhaps the cell-to-cell attachment of matrix-producing cells would be harmed if cells simultaneously produced surfactin. The fact that <italic>eps tasA</italic> + <italic>srfA</italic> chimeras—colonies in which different strains perform different tasks—can expand further than WT colonies suggests there may indeed be a trade-off at play.</p>
<p>Besides surfactin, matrix production can also be triggered by environmental stressors like starvation, hypoxia, and osmotic stress [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Environmental changes during colony growth might therefore also be responsible for the temporal up-regulation of matrix production and the transition from the dendrite to the petal growth phase. We showed that cells isolated from the petal growth phase readily switch back to dendrite formation, when re-inoculated on a fresh growth medium. This indicates that the environment is indeed an important determinant for the different growth phases. When van Gogh bundles first appear, the matrix-producing cells are surrounded by surfactin-producing cells. Given their proximity, the co-occurring cell types probably sense nearly identical environmental conditions, yet they behave differently [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This indicates that—besides depending on the environment—cell differentiation also depends on inherent stochasticity. A recent study showed that under constant environmental conditions, cells can spontaneously differentiate into matrix-producing cell chains [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] that are preserved for a number of generations due to a regulatory feedback loop that creates a bi-stable switch [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. A similar switch might also be important for the first cell chains that appear in the formation of van Gogh bundles.</p>
<p>While previous studies have shown that surfactin production and EPS production can affect colony expansion [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], these studies did not show a synergistic interaction between cell types. In addition, the colony expansion in our study is of a different nature than the ones described in previous studies. For example, EPS production has been shown to have a relatively small effect on biofilm colony expansion, and that effect was hypothesized to depend on osmotic pressures [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Here we show that EPS has an all-or-none effect on colony expansion during sliding motility. The migration of van Gogh bundles does not directly rely on osmotic gradients, but instead results from mechanic force (although osmotic gradients can affect cell differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]). Hence, EPS stimulates migration by allowing for the organization of van Gogh bundles. How EPS exactly guides bundle formation requires further examination. Our results suggest that EPS is required for side-to-side attachment of cell chains. However, EPS might also affect the pole-to-pole interactions. Besides being essential in the formation of van Gogh bundles, EPS production was also essential for dendrite formation. At this early growth phase, matrix-producing cells do form multicellular clumps, but these clumps lack the tight alignment of cells that characterizes the van Gogh bundles. Thus, the mere presence of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells does not guarantee the formation of van Gogh bundles. It would be interesting to examine why matrix-producing cells are essential for dendrite formation, while forming van Gogh bundles only in the petal growth phase.</p>
<p>The functions of EPS and TasA inside the van Gogh bundle are different. Whereas EPS is absolutely necessary for the formation of van Gogh bundles, TasA seems to fine-tune the folding properties of the van Gogh bundles. TasA specifically localizes to the pole-to-pole interaction zones of TasA-producing cells inside the van Gogh bundle. Our mathematical model shows that the folding properties of van Gogh bundles determine the efficiency of migration: when the filament is less likely to fold, it can expand farther in space. We suggest that TasA might affect folding, by manipulating the bending rigidity at the pole-to-pole interactions between cells. Although this claim awaits further biophysical quantification, our study suggests that both EPS and TasA have specialized functions that guide the development of van Gogh bundles [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In this way, matrix-producing cells can organize themselves into multicellular structures that facilitate migration.</p>
<p><italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> is not the only species that switches to a multicellular lifestyle to accomplish migration. Filamentous structures also occur during the colony growth of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vortex</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mycoides</italic>, whose growth patterns are described in the Introduction [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, an impressive study by Vilain and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] showed that the closely related species <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cereus</italic> switches to a multicellular lifestyle when grown on filter-sterilized soil-extracted soluble organic matter (SESOM) or artificial soil microcosm (ASM)—media that mimic the environmental conditions cells encounter in the soil. They showed that the lifestyle switch to multicellularity allows for migration. Interestingly, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mycoides</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> show the same lifestyle switch when exposed to SESOM or ASM. This strongly supports our hypothesis that the collective properties that emerge from the interaction between surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells—van Gogh bundles—evolved to facilitate migration. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the domesticated lab strain, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> 168, which is known to be defective in surfactin production, cannot make the switch to a multicellular lifestyle when grown on SESOM or ASM [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. It would be interesting to examine whether SESOM and ASM indeed induce surfactin and matrix production and hence the development of van Gogh bundles in the wild isolate of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>.</p>
<p>Like other forms of bacterial multicellularity [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], van Gogh bundles illustrate how the organization of cells can help to overcome important ecological challenges. Ultimately, we hope that the study of such simple forms of organization can improve our understanding on how evolution constructs [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]: how cells can evolve to become integrated collectives that, together, form a new organizational unit.</p>

All strains were derived from the WT NCIB3610, which is a non-domesticated isolate [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Colonies were grown on a modified MSgg medium. MSgg medium is typically used to study <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> biofilm or pellicle formation [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fall and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] adjusted the medium to study <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> sliding. In contrast to swimming and swarming motility, sliding is a flagellum-independent type of motility that depends on cell division [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].

In our study, we used the variant of MSggN with 100 μM KCl. Twenty milliliters of MSggN medium was used per petri dish (diameter = 9 cm); the medium was solidified by adding 0.6% agarose. Plates were prepared 1 d before inoculation and were poured at a fixed temperature of 65°C. Plates were turned upside down about 15–30 min after pouring them and left in a single layer at room temperature for 16–18 h before inoculating the cell culture. Plates were in a single layer when incubated in the 37°C room for the sliding assay. For each experiment fresh medium was prepared, using the same medium for all growth and replicate conditions.</p>

<title>Inoculation conditions</title>
<p>Two standard inoculation conditions were used for the experiments: plates were inoculated from overnight (O/N) colonies grown on MSggN (37°C) by either (1) toothpick inoculation or (2) pipet inoculation with 2 μl of colony suspension. For the colony suspension, the O/N colony was re-suspended in 300 μl of PBS, after which the cell density was normalized to an optical density (λ = 600 nm) of 2. In cases where cells were toothpick inoculated, this is mentioned in the figure caption. Since for these inoculation conditions cells came from O/N-grown colonies, some cells had already produced surfactin or matrix at the onset of colony growth. As a control, in which no surfactin- and matrix-producing cells were present in the inocula (e.g., used for the experiment associated with <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), we applied a passaging method before inoculating cells onto the agar plate [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p>
<p>For passaging, cells were grown in 5-ml LB broth cultures for eight consecutive cycles using 16-ml test tubes (37°C). In the first cycle, cells were grown for 2 h, while for all other cycles, for 1.5 h. The first passaging cycle was initiated by cells from an O/N colony grown on MSggN (37°C). Then, the cell culture of the first growth cycle was used to inoculate the second, etcetera. At the onset of each new cycle, the cells were diluted to a target OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.004. On average, cells divided 4.12 ± 0.36 (mean ± standard deviation) times per cycle, making the average doubling time 22 min. The optical density at the end of a cycle was on average 0.072 ± 0.017. Cell cultures were on average diluted 17.97 ± 4.32 times from one cycle to the next. Although similar passaging experiments had been shown to eliminate matrix-producing cells from the inocula [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], it was yet unclear whether the same would hold for surfactin-producing cells. Therefore, we monitored <italic>tapA</italic> and <italic>srfA</italic> expression (using fluorescent reporters in a double-labeled P<sub><italic>tapA</italic></sub>-CFP P<sub><italic>srfA</italic></sub>-YFP strain) for the different inoculation conditions (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>): the default inoculum condition, as described above, and different stages in the passaging experiment. Cell cultures at the end of cycle 6 (blue in <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>) and 8 (purple) of the passaging experiment were examined, as well as two cases in which we did not transfer the cultures from one cycle to the next, but instead let them grow for three consecutive cycles without passaging (yellow and green in <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>). As expected, the cell culture at the end of the passaging experiment (purple) did not have cells that produced surfactin or matrix, while the normal inoculum from O/N colonies (red) did. Passaging was essential to prevent cell differentiation, since cultures that grew for three consecutive cycles without re-inoculation showed strong cell differentiation (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>The preparation of colony samples for microscopy</title>
<p>For the time-course experiments shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002141.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, colonies were dispersed before data acquisition by microscopy. Colony samples were scraped from the agar plate and re-suspended in PBS; depending on the colony size, 100–1,000 μl of PBS was used. After this, the colony suspension was mixed using a vortex and, if there were still clumps left, treated by additional re-suspension with a syringe (23 gauge needle). To check fluorescence intensity profiles, 10 μl of the colony suspension was inoculated on an agarose patch that was solidified on a microscope slide (200 μl of 1.5% agarose in PBS flattened on a microscopy slide).</p>
<p>In cases where intact colony edges were examined by microscopy, a piece of the colony edge was cut from the agar plate. This piece was subsequently flipped onto a glass-bottom well (PELCO Glass Bottom Dish) and immediately analyzed under the microscope. In all cases, replicate samples were used from the same colony as well as from different colonies, to see how variable the observed cellular structures were inside the colony and between different colonies.</p>

<title>Microscopy, imaging, and image analysis</title>
<p>For imaging, four different devices were used: a digital camera with a macro lens, a stereomicroscope, an upright microscope, and an inverted microscope (see below for product details). All high-magnification imaging at the cellular level was done with the inverted microscope (60× magnification). High-magnification images were used for gene expression analyses. The fluorescence intensities in microscope images were analyzed using a standard procedure: (1) images were taken using constant fluorescent exposure times, (2) images were loaded and segmented in a MatLab program [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], and (3) pixel data were written to text files that could be analyzed with available statistics software (in this study, R; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). All images were included in the analysis, except for a few images that were out of focus.

<p>For plate imaging, a Nikon D7000 camera was used with an AF Micro Nikkor 60-mm macro lens. The stereomicroscope was a Zeiss Stemi SV6 stereomicroscope equipped with a 1.0× Achromat S objective lens and an AxioCam charge-coupled device (CCD) video camera system (Zeiss). For imaging, we used Axiovision suite software from Zeiss. The upright microscope was a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus equipped with an A-Plan 10× objective and a long-distance Plan-NEOFLUAR 20× objective. The camera was an AxioCam MRc (Zeiss) with Axiovision software to capture images. The inverted microscope was a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope equipped with a 20× Plan Apo objective and a 60× Plan Apo oil objective. Pictures were made with a Hamamatsu digital camera, model ORCA-ER. Filter sets were from Chroma, model #52017 (CFP-YFP dual-band filter), and model #62002v2 (DAPI/FITC/Texas Red).</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>We constructed a model to study how cellular properties could influence features of multicellular organization such as the folding properties of the van Gogh bundles, which are important for the rate of colony expansion. We did not aim to accurately model the biophysical details of the growth of van Gogh bundles (parameterization of such a model would be impossible), but rather to make a simple phenomenological model to shape our intuition based on previous models of epithelium folding [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In the model we examine the growth of a cellular filament. Unlike the van Gogh bundles, the filament is simplified to a single chain of pole-to-pole-attached cells. The cells in the filament can elongate, divide, and turn and thereby affect the macroscopic shape of the filament. The filament is placed in a two-dimensional space with fixed boundaries (the space is 1 × 1 spatial units big; this size is relevant for the cell size and growth rate mentioned below). The cells inside the filament are not allowed to overlap, and the ends of the filament are fixed in space, as being attached to the colony. At the start of each simulation, the filament consists of <italic>N</italic> cells that are placed as a horizontal line at the bottom of the two dimensional space (<italic>y-</italic>coordinate is 0). The filament is updated every time step by selecting a random cell from the population and performing one out of three possible update events: (1) cell elongation, (2) cell division, or (3) cell turning. After <italic>T</italic> time steps the simulation is stopped. The final shape of the filament results from the accumulation of local update events. The degree of colony expansion is measured in the <italic>y</italic>-direction. Here we give a short description for each of the three update events (see <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec019">
<title>Event 1: Cell elongation</title>
<p>Cells grow with rate <italic>R</italic> per time step. <italic>R</italic> is taken from a uniform distribution ranging from 0 to <italic>G</italic> (i.e., the maximal growth rate). The average growth rate of a cell is therefore ½<italic>G</italic>. Since cells occur inside a filament, cell elongation affects the spatial orientation of cells. We assume that a cell grows in the direction of one of its neighboring cells (this neighbor is randomly selected). When a cell elongates, it pushes its neighboring cell away, both cells thereby change their relative position. Cell elongation is illustrated in the upper panel of <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Event 2: Cell division</title>
<p>When a cell exceeds the maximum cell size, <italic>S</italic>, it divides. The mother cell is divided in two equally long daughter cells. Division results in a new filament junction. Importantly, during the process of cell division the spatial orientation of the daughter cells is identical to that of the mother cell (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>). In other words, the filament does not change its shape during cell division. The cell size is checked after each cell elongation event, thereby assuring that no cells are larger than the maximum cell size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec021">
<title>Event 3: Cell turning</title>
<p>Perhaps the most intricate update event is cell turning. During an event of cell turning, the focal cell changes its spatial orientation with respect to its neighboring cells. The spatial orientation of a cell is adjusted in two steps. First a potential new spatial orientation is generated by randomly turning one of a focal cell’s neighboring cells with an angle β (taken from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation <italic>B</italic>), thereby adjusting as well the orientation of the focal cell itself and of the focal cell’s other neighboring cell. Second, the potential new spatial orientation is compared with the old one, and the new spatial orientation is adopted only if it is energetically favorable.</p>
<p>The spatial configuration of cells is associated with a certain energy state, which is the so-called potential energy that is stored in the current state of the system (i.e., bending energy). Cells are expected to change their spatial configuration such that the potential energy is minimized. The potential energy relates to the spatial orientation of cells in the following way (see <xref rid="pbio.1002141.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref> for the angles):</p>

<p><italic>P</italic> is the chance that a cell turns to its new spatial orientation, and <italic>k</italic> is a parameter that determines the bending rigidity. When <italic>k</italic> is high, a drop in the potential energy (<italic>V</italic><sub>n</sub> &lt; <italic>V</italic><sub>c</sub>) is more likely to result in a re-orientation of the cells, thereby reducing the angle between a cell and its neighbors. In other words, cells are considered resistant against bending (i.e., high bending rigidity) when they are likely to reduce the angle between them and their neighbors (i.e., minimizing the local curvature).</p>
<p>In the main text we consider three different parameter settings (<xref rid="pbio.1002141.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>): (1) default setting, (2) high bending rigidity, and (3) large cell size. It is currently impossible to quantitatively compare our experimental results with the simulation outcomes, because an accurate parameterization of the model is not possible. It is however possible to qualitatively compare the different parameter settings with the experimental results obtained by microscopy.

<title>Measurement of cell alignment.</title>
<p>Here we show the two steps that underlie the quantification of cell alignment. In the first step, cells are segmented using advanced image analysis software, MicrobeTracker [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], thereby determining a cell’s outline and major axis. The major axis is divided in approximately equally sized cell segments to account for the curvature of a cell. In the second step, the alignment of cell segments is determined by comparing the spatial orientation of the focal cell segment with that of its neighbors (excluding segments that belong to the same cell as the focal cell segment). The neighborhood includes all segments that are within a radius of 20 pixels of the focal cell segment.</p>

<title>Folding properties of filamentous loops in wild-type and <italic>tasA</italic> mutant colonies.</title>
<p>The folding properties of the outermost loops at the colony edge of WT and <italic>tasA</italic> colonies are characterized by the distribution of angles. A segmented line is drawn on top of each loop, with regularly sized line segments (accomplished by a mesh overlay). The angles between the neighboring line segments determine the folding properties of a filamentous loop. <italic>tasA</italic> loops have more and stronger folds than WT loops, as is apparent from the distributions of angles; the relative angles between line segments in <italic>tasA</italic> loops are smaller (Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>, <italic>W</italic> = 206,266). Five microscopy images were examined for each strain, resulting in 509 and 625 concatenated line segments in <italic>tasA</italic> mutant and WT loops, respectively.</p>

<title>Artificial induction of <italic>tasA</italic> expression and colony expansion.</title>
<p><italic>tasA</italic> transcription was artificially induced in an IPTG-inducible <italic>tasA</italic> strain by adding 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mM IPTG to growth medium (MSggN). Romero and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002141.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that the WT biofilm morphology on MSgg (similar to our growth medium, MSggN) can be recovered in an IPTG-inducible <italic>tasA</italic> strain by adding 0.2 mM IPTG. Colony morphology is not recovered by adding IPTG to our growth medium (i.e., dendrites are lacking), but colony expansion is recovered (i.e., not considering morphology) when 0.05 mM IPTG or more is added.</p>

<title>Schematic overview of events that can occur during filament growth in the model.</title>
<p>Three cellular events can occur: (1) cell elongation, (2) cell division, and (3) cell turning. Cells are shown as rectangles, with red lines through their major axes and red dots at the pole ends. The red circles surrounding the cells help to determine the spatial orientation of cells. For example, during elongation a cell becomes longer, but also the spatial orientation of cells changes in accordance with the new intersection point between the corresponding red circles (compare dashed and solid red circles in the upper right panel). The spatial orientation of cells during cell division remains unaltered. Cell turning depends on the angle between the focal cell and its neighbors (α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub>). Cells turn if the randomly generated new orientation is energetically favorable compared to the original orientation (see model description in Materials and Methods for details).</p>
