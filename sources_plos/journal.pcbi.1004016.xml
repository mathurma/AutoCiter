<abstract>
<p>Bacterial secondary metabolites are widely used as antibiotics, anticancer drugs, insecticides and food additives. Attempts to engineer their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to produce unnatural metabolites with improved properties are often frustrated by the unpredictability and complexity of the enzymes that synthesize these molecules, suggesting that genetic changes within BGCs are limited by specific constraints. Here, by performing a systematic computational analysis of BGC evolution, we derive evidence for three findings that shed light on the ways in which, despite these constraints, nature successfully invents new molecules: 1) BGCs for complex molecules often evolve through the successive merger of smaller sub-clusters, which function as independent evolutionary entities. 2) An important subset of polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases evolve by concerted evolution, which generates sets of sequence-homogenized domains that may hold promise for engineering efforts since they exhibit a high degree of functional interoperability, 3) Individual BGC families evolve in distinct ways, suggesting that design strategies should take into account family-specific functional constraints. These findings suggest novel strategies for using synthetic biology to rationally engineer biosynthetic pathways.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Bacterial secondary metabolites mediate a broad range of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, and are widely used in human medicine, agriculture and manufacturing. Despite recent advances in synthetic biology, efforts to engineer their biosynthetic genes for the production of unnatural variants are frustrated by a high failure rate. In an effort to better understand what types of genetic changes are most likely to lead to successful improvements, we systematically analyzed the ways in which biosynthetic genes naturally evolve to generate new compounds. We show that large gene clusters appear to evolve through the merger of sub-clusters, which function independently, and are promising units for cluster engineering. Moreover, a subset of gene clusters evolve by concerted evolution, which generates sets of interoperable domains that may enable predictable domain swapping. Finally, many biosynthetic gene clusters evolve in family-specific modes that differ greatly from each other. Overall, this quantitative perspective on the ways in which gene clusters naturally evolve suggests novel strategies for using synthetic biology to engineer the production of unnatural metabolites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacterial secondary metabolites are widely used as pharmaceutical, agricultural, and dietary agents. They consist of many classes of compounds including polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), terpenoids, saccharides, and a plethora of hybrids. The genetic basis for this rich molecular diversity can be found in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), physically clustered groups of genes that encode the enzymatic pathways necessary to construct specific chemicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Osbourn1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Nett1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The diversity of extant natural products and BGCs raises important questions about their evolutionary origin. These include the basic question of how Nature invents new molecules, and a series of applied questions relevant to biotechnology: for example, the evolutionary modularity of NRP and PK BGCs has long been seen as a feature that might allow large libraries of new compounds to be generated by mixing and matching their constituent domains and modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Sherman1">[3]</xref>. However, although there have been notable successes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Menzella1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Menzella2">[6]</xref>, the majority of combinatorially generated pathways appear to be nonfunctional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Menzella1">[4]</xref>. More recently, advanced synthetic biology approaches to pathway engineering have been frustrated by the complexity and unpredictability of metabolic enzymes, particularly NRPSs and PKSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Kwok1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Cimermancic1">[8]</xref>: unlike LEGO bricks, their constituent domains and modules do not ‘fit’ together universally, but only function effectively in specific pathway contexts.</p>
<p>Regardless of these apparent constraints to genetic change, Nature appears to have been quite successful at engineering biosynthetic pathways through the process of gene cluster evolution: even a conservative estimate suggests that the number of broad biosynthetic gene cluster families that have evolved exceeds 6,000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Cimermancic1">[8]</xref>, most of which contain multiple BGCs that synthesize derivatives of a common scaffold. Hence, a detailed study of evolutionary patterns within various BGC families has the potential to offer a new inroad into effective BGC engineering, through mimicry of Nature's evolutionary design strategies.</p>
<p>So far, insights into the key principles underlying the evolution of BGC architectures and repertoires have been derived from limited case studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Moffitt1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Freel1">[13]</xref>, which lack sufficient detail about the generality of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we systematically quantify the strategies that make evolution so successful at engineering BGC diversity. Through a detailed computational analysis of a recently generated dataset of 732 known and 10,724 predicted prokaryotic BGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Cimermancic1">[8]</xref>, we find that the rates of evolutionary events, such as insertions, deletions and duplications within BGCs, are much higher than those seen in comparable gene clusters involved in primary metabolism. Furthermore, distinct sub-clusters consisting of co-evolving genes appear to constitute relatively independent building blocks that play key roles in the evolution of larger BGCs encoding the biosynthesis of complex metabolites. Finally, BGC families encoding the production of polyketides and nonribosomal peptides evolve in family-specific modes, in many of which we observe an unexpectedly large role for concerted evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Liao1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Santoyo1">[15]</xref> driven by internal recombinations. Based on these observations, we offer several recommendations for establishing new modes of evolution-guided BGC engineering.</p>

<title>BGCs are rapidly evolving genomic entities</title>
<p>The large diversity of BGCs observed throughout the prokaryotic tree of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Cimermancic1">[8]</xref> suggests that BGCs evolve rapidly. Indeed, when we systematically quantified different evolutionary events by mutually comparing all gene clusters in our data set (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s012">Table S1</xref></bold>), we found not only that they may have been transferred horizontally at high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g001"><bold>Fig. 1a</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), but also display exceptionally high rates of insertions, deletions, duplications and rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g001"><bold>Fig. 1b</bold></xref>). While the percentage of gene cluster pairs related by an indel is independent of gene cluster size, the distribution of indel sizes shows a long tail that includes 195 indels of 10 kb or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g001"><bold>Fig. 1c</bold></xref>). As expected, these large indels are more commonly found in larger gene clusters, where they indicate either the merger of one gene cluster fragment with another or the loss of a gene cluster fragment from a larger cluster (see examples in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Phylogenetic profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Pellegrini1">[16]</xref> showed that many such BGC fragments – here termed sub-clusters – appear to evolve in a correlated fashion: 884 different motifs of adjacent Pfam domains (out of 7,641 found) were shown to co-evolve significantly more often than not (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), based on the χ<sup>2</sup> test. These motifs comprise 591 different Pfam domains and have an average length of 5.3 domains (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s013">Table S2</xref></bold>). As expected, they include many well-known and widely conserved motifs that appear to be linked to specific sub-functionalities of gene clusters, such as precursor biosynthesis, transport or synthesis of a specific chemical moiety, and motifs belonging to modular BGC architectures of NRPSs and PKSs (e.g., C-A-T and KS-AT-T <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Fischbach1">[17]</xref>).</p>

Ribosomal gene clusters were selected for comparison based on their relatively large sizes (∼10–15 kb) compared to primary metabolic operons; to obtain a fair comparison with BGCs, only gene clusters of sizes 5–15 kb were taken into account. Counts are based on a systematic comparison of all gene clusters in our data set that share regions of &gt;1000 bp with &gt;70% identity, in which events were inferred from alignments of such 1000 bp blocks. Of the 10,096 BGC pairs meeting these criteria, 1,750 had a rearrangement, 1,140 had an indel, and 135 had a duplication, each of which were far more common than the corresponding evolutionary events in gene clusters encoding the translation apparatus. Interestingly, while indels and rearrangements could be detected in ∼16% and ∼19% of BGCs of all sizes, duplications are found far more commonly in gene clusters with sizes of &gt;40 kb (7.6%) than in gene clusters with sizes of 10–20 kb (0.3%), suggesting a possible role for duplication and divergence in the evolution of large gene clusters. <bold>c</bold>, Size distribution of inserted/deleted fragments during recent gene cluster evolution, based on the indel analysis.</p>

<title>Sub-cluster sharing enables evolutionary ‘recombineering’ of BGCs</title>
<p>Earlier evidence has suggested complex mosaic patterns of sub-cluster sharing for some BGCs, such as those involved in the production of glycopeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Donadio1">[18]</xref>. To further explore the role of sub-cluster sharing in the evolution of BGCs, we manually compiled a set of 35 BGCs that are rich in sub-clusters that have a known connection with a specific chemical moiety. We then used this data set to construct a network in which the nodes represent BGCs and the edges denote a sub-cluster that a pair of BGCs has in common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). Three observations were particularly notable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). First, &gt;60% of the coding capacity of some BGCs (e.g., those encoding vancomycin and rubradirin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Kim1">[19]</xref>) is composed of individually conserved sub-clusters (note that this is not entirely reflected in the depiction of the rubradirin gene cluster in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g002"><bold>Fig. 2b</bold></xref>, where only those sub-clusters are highlighted that are shared with other depicted BGCs). This supports a “bricks and mortar” model of gene cluster evolution in which gene clusters are composed of large, modular “bricks” (sub-clusters) that encode key building blocks and individual genes (the “mortar”) that encode functions such as tailoring, regulation and transport. During evolution, both bricks and mortar (scaffold and tailoring) may remain the same, only the tailoring may change or the scaffold itself may change. Second, the same sub-cluster commonly appears in otherwise unrelated BGCs, and multiple unrelated sub-clusters can be found in a single parent gene cluster, indicating that sub-clusters are independent evolutionary entities. Third, sub-clusters are not static; they are loosely organized around a core set of genes, but gene gain/loss leads to chemical changes in the corresponding part structure: for example, gene clusters encoding molecules such as everninomicin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Staffa1">[20]</xref>, simocyclinone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Trefzer1">[21]</xref> and polyketomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Daum1">[22]</xref> have different variants of deoxysugar sub-clusters, which lead to subtle variations in the final chemical structures.</p>

<p><bold>a</bold>, Network of sub-clusters shared among 34 known BGCs. Nodes represent BGCs, and node size indicates the number of sub-clusters present in the gene cluster that are shared with other BGCs within the network. Edges represent shared sub-clusters, coded by color. The pattern of sharing indicates that many sub-clusters are regularly transferred between BGCs of different types. In the interpretation of this analysis, it should be kept in mind that in rare cases different biosynthetic routes (and hence, different sub-clusters) exist towards the same moiety. <bold>b</bold>, A sub-network from <bold>a</bold> showing the shared sub-clusters among the BGCs for rubradirin, rifamycin, simocyclinone, everninomicin, and polyketomycin, as well as the chemical moieties encoded by the sub-clusters.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004016.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Although the complex patterns of sub-cluster sharing, in which various sub-clusters are shared between otherwise completely different gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>), indicate that BGCs may evolve by the successive merger of sub-clusters, this does not mean that every case where sub-clusters are shared points to an independent sub-cluster transfer event. For example, the KS domains of the diverse range of ansamycin type I PKS BGCs that harbor AHBA sub-clusters are almost completely monophyletic (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>), indicating that the macrolactam- and AHBA-producing sub-clusters have been co-evolving for a long time (instead of multiple independent AHBA sub-cluster acquisitions having occurred in different macrolactam-producing polyketide BGCs). Hence, the multi-hybrid rubradirin gene cluster might have arisen from a rifamycin-like ancestor (most rubradirin KS domains are monophyletic with rifamycin KS domains, see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>) that already harbored the combination of a modular type I PKS sub-cluster and an AHBA biosynthesis sub-cluster, and which then acquired new sub-clusters for the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin, 3,4-dihydroxydipicolinate and nitrosugar moieties (which are not found in any other closely related ansamycins). Contrary to the shared evolutionary histories of AHBA and ansamycin type I PKS sub-clusters, a clear example of sub-cluster transfer between BGCs of different types can be seen for 6-methylsalicylic acid (MSAS)/orsellinic acid (OSAS) sub-clusters, as inferred from a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of MSAS/OSAS-producing iterative PKSs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). The topology of this tree strongly indicates that MSAS/OSAS sub-clusters have largely evolved independent of the scaffold types of their parent gene clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>), and that they have been transferred between multiple types of BGCs during their evolutionary past. In conclusion, in the context of the bricks-and-mortar analogy, some bricks move around between different structures more often than others. Finally, we should note that there are also BGC families which evolve over long periods of time without major changes to the gene cluster architecture or the scaffold of the core molecule made: for example, the large family of over &gt;1,000 aryl polyene BGCs that we described recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Cimermancic1">[8]</xref> has not undergone any major sub-cluster transfers, aside from the inclusion of the dialkylresorcinol sub-cluster in the BGCs from some CFB group bacteria. The products of many of these BGCs are likely to be entirely identical, while remaining differences between the molecules mostly concern differential tailoring of the same scaffold.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Evolution from one scaffold to another</title>
<p>Many chemical scaffold types of secondary metabolite classes are quite distinct, which raises the question of how BGC families encoding the synthesis of distinct scaffolds are related. To assess this question, we calculated the proportion and similarity of Pfam domains shared between all pairs of BGCs within our data set of 732 known gene clusters using multiple sequence alignments for each Pfam domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>) and looked specifically for close homologues of BGCs just outside their immediate family. Even though of course sequence similarity alone does not provide conclusive evidence on evolutionary histories, the analysis did suggest that unexpected evolutionary connections might exist between natural products of different scaffold types.</p>

<title>Unexpected evolutionary relationships within the rapamycin family.</title>
<p><bold>a</bold>, Distinct scaffolds produced by pathways from related BGCs. The scatter plot shows the relationship between the sequence homology of a pair of BGCs (x-axis) and the structural homology of their small molecule products (y-axis), compared to rapamycin and its BGC. Each circle represents a gene cluster and its small molecule product. Meridamycin and FK520 are closely related to rapamycin, as are their BGCs. While the pladienolide BGC is closely related to the rapamycin BGC, the structure of pladienolide itself is not very similar to that of rapamycin. In particular, pladienolide has a much smaller macrocycle and lacks shikimate- or pipecolate-derived moieties, and, as a result, binds to a distinct protein target.

When we performed a more in-depth analysis through a phylogenetic analysis of condensation domains, we indeed found that GPL domains consistently cluster together with domains from the NRPSs that synthesize daptomycin (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold>). Although both daptomycin and the GPLs are lipopeptides, the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> GPLs are shorter (tetrapeptide vs. tridecapeptide), cell-wall-associated rather than diffusible, linear rather than cyclic, and originate from an actinomycete genus that is not closely related to <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p>

Strikingly, based on phylogenetic trees of their constituent ketosynthase (KS) and acyltransferase (AT) domains, the meridamycin gene cluster is more closely related to the pladienolide BGC than to those encoding rapamycin and FK520, the molecules to which it is often compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>).

<title>Concerted evolution in the rapamycin family</title>
<p>The phylogenetic trees of KS and AT domains from our data set of known BGCs revealed another unexpected finding: in spite of the structural similarity of rapamycin and FK520, 63% of the constituent domains of their polyketide synthases (PKSs) cluster into entirely separate clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g003"><bold>Fig. 3b</bold></xref>, see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold> which shows that relevant bootstrap values are almost all above 90). Even more remarkably, 14 out of 16 domains responsible for the biosynthesis of the sub-structure shared between these two molecules (shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g003"><bold>Fig. 3c</bold></xref>) do not cluster together with the corresponding domain from the assembly line for the other molecule. This pattern of homology is consistent with a phenomenon called ‘concerted evolution’, the homogenization of DNA sequences within a given repetitive family caused by high rates of internal recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Liao1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Santoyo1">[15]</xref>. Given the similar sizes and architectures of the gene clusters and the structural similarity of their products, this is a much more parsimonious explanation for the patterns observed than convergent evolution of multiple similar gene clusters through successive duplication of an ancestral single-module PKS. Notably, previous phylogenetic analyses of PKS domains have also observed BGC-specific clades of PKS domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-JenkeKodama1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Zucko1">[30]</xref>, but not to the extent observed here for such closely related gene clusters: the fact that such a strong pattern is even observed for the AT domains of two different gene clusters that encode the same molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Sun1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-He1">[28]</xref>, meridamycin, shows that the underlying process may operate on very short time scales, and that recombination can remove almost all traces of independent evolution of these PKS modules. In the case of the rapamycin family, recombinations are likely to occur neutrally and have no effect on the structure of the small molecule product (rapamycin, meridamycin and FK520), whereas in other cases, single crossovers within or between gene clusters may dramatically change the modular architecture of a synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Zucko1">[30]</xref>. Near-neutral changes brought about by gene conversion may occur at higher rates for some domains or domain types than for others: in the meridamycin gene clusters, no signs of gene conversion could (yet) be observed for KS domains, even though gene conversion manifested itself clearly when comparing the meridamycin clusters with those encoding rapamycin, FK520 and pladienolide. On the contrary, AT domain gene conversion was widespread even between the two meridamycin gene clusters. We speculate that for these BGCs, gene conversion events get fixated in the population at lower rates for KS domains because not all KS sequences work equally well for different polyketide chain lengths that occur at different points of the assembly line, so that the changes brought about by a conversion event are less neutral than for AT domains. Mapping of rapamycin family PKS sequence mutations onto the 3D structure of an AT- and KS-containing protein further supports this hypothesis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s007">Figure S7a</xref></bold>), showing widespread sequence variability at almost every position in the AT domains, except for the residues near the substrate binding site (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s007">Figure S7b</xref></bold>). Mutations in KS domains, on the other hand, are mostly restricted to the regions in vicinity (around the core) of the substrate-binding site and the dimerization interface (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s007">Figure S7c</xref></bold>), suggesting their importance in influencing substrate selectivity.</p>

<p>After modules are duplicated, they may get ‘trapped’ in a cycle in which small sequence divergences are counterbalanced by internal recombinations that drive concerted evolution. Through strong diversifying selection (or sufficient drift), domains may break out of this cycle towards domain sequences that are protected from concerted evolution by functional divergence and subsequent stabilizing selection on the new function, or by reduced internal recombination rates due to larger sequence differences between the domains. The abovementioned sequence divergence may occur through cumulative mutation or through recombination with other gene clusters (or other modules within the same gene cluster).</p>

<title>Distinct mechanisms of PKS/NRPS BGC evolution</title>
<p>To understand more generally how PKS and NRPS BGCs evolve, we set out to measure the contributions of concerted evolution, duplication, and divergence to the evolution of all multimodular PKS and NRPS BGCs in both our known and predicted BGC data sets. We first collected and quantified 25 different features describing the nature of gene cluster sequences and the relationships among their constituent domains (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">methods</xref> for details). A principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering using these features can distinguish many of the well-known gene cluster families from our data set of known BGCs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s009">Figure S9</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g005"><bold>Fig. 5a</bold></xref>). Two features in particular, the ‘internal similarity index’ and the ‘vertical evolution index’, explain much of the variation in terms of the modes of evolution of different classes of gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g005"><bold>Fig. 5b</bold></xref>). At the level of individual domains, we find that there are four primary mechanisms by which NRPS and PKS BGCs evolve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004016-g005"><bold>Fig. 5c–f</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s010">Figure S10</xref></bold>). Firstly, gene clusters encoding glycopeptides, calcium-dependent lipopeptides and macrolides/polyethers appear to be most repetitive, pointing to a history of module duplications and/or a prominent influence of concerted evolution. The syringopeptin NRPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-ScholzSchroeder1">[48]</xref> and mycolactone PKS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Stinear1">[49]</xref> are extreme examples of this: both are likely to have evolved recently by subsequent module duplications and concerted evolution. Secondly, we sometimes observed gradients of the internal homology <italic>p</italic>-values from the N- to C-termini of large synthases, suggesting that some gene clusters evolve to encode the synthesis of larger molecules by iterative duplication of their most N-terminal module, would have the effect of extending an intermediate NRP or PK by the addition of a new starter unit. Thirdly, a group of BGCs including the ones that encode the polyketides psymberin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Fisch1">[42]</xref> and erythrochelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Lazos1">[50]</xref> show a ‘vertical’ type of evolution, in which the domains appear to evolve independently, with perhaps occasional domain swapping with related gene clusters, as has been suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Nguyen2">[40]</xref>. Finally, there are many gene clusters showing a ‘mixed’ mode of evolution, in which one or more of the above mechanisms are combined. For example, NRP siderophore gene clusters show some signs of internal recombinations, but at the same time many domains show no high mutual similarity. Like the trans-AT PKS gene clusters, they seem to have a higher tendency to recruit domains from dissimilar gene clusters. This recruitment over larger evolutionary distances appears to be a general feature of NRPS gene clusters as opposed to PKS gene clusters, and might be related to the wider range of possible substrates for NRPSs, which often require BGC-specific sub-pathways for the synthesis of a dedicated monomer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Wilkinson1">[51]</xref>.</p>

<title>Birth and death of biosynthetic gene clusters during evolution</title>
<p>The observation of so many different evolutionary mechanisms of gene cluster evolution begs the question which circumstances lead to the birth and death of BGCs over evolutionary time. Are all BGCs that are detected bioinformatically also still intact and functional, or might many of them have degenerated and entered a nonfunctional state? The absence or presence of nonfunctional genetic units (e.g., pseudogenes or pseudo-gene-clusters) is largely governed by the evolutionary population dynamics of the species. Many bacteria live in large effective population sizes and have relatively short generation times, leading to very strong purifying selection and, consequently, rigorous genome streamlining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Lynch1">[52]</xref>. Hence, BGCs that become nonfunctional will be quickly lost in such organisms if they do not provide any evolutionary advantage. Notably, some bacteria in fact occur in smaller population sizes and/or regularly go through population bottlenecks, leading to altogether different evolutionary dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Burke1">[53]</xref>: in such cases, a range of pseudogenized gene clusters can sometimes still be observed that have not been purged from the genome yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Tobias1">[54]</xref>. On the whole, however, these appear to be rather the exception than the rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Lawrence1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>Concerning the birth of new gene cluster architectures, large effective population sizes and short generation times also suggest that BGC modifications should immediately confer an evolutionary advantage in order to be maintained; on the other hand, frequent changes in population size may affect the probability of mutations to be fixated in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Otto1">[56]</xref>. Alternatively, neutral mutations could hitchhike with strongly adaptive mutations within or close to the same gene cluster. Concerning the physical growth of gene clusters, it should be noted that new enzymes may already be recruited to a biosynthetic pathway before their genes are physically recruited to the gene cluster, and such an addition to a pathway could evolve through, e.g., positive selection acting on promiscuous enzyme activities or substrate specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Aharoni1">[57]</xref>. The precise reason for and evolutionary mechanism of clustering of biosynthetic genes in bacteria itself is still largely an unanswered question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Martin1">[58]</xref>.</p>

<title>Implications for biosynthetic engineering</title>
<p>Our analysis of BGC evolution will enable new approaches to BGC engineering informed by the mechanisms by which BGCs evolve naturally. Our results suggest that efforts to engineer the biosynthesis of unnatural natural products could be more successful by observing the modes by which specific BGC classes evolve in nature.</p>
<p>For example, conglomerate molecules consisting of multiple different chemical moieties could be designed by engineering BGCs consisting of novel combinations of sub-clusters. Such an effort could be guided by information taken from evolutionary comparisons, which would offer suggestions about which sub-clusters are most likely to function together, based on how often evolution has successfully forged combinations between them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our evolutionary analysis of NRPS and PKS gene clusters suggests that concerted evolution has created sets of domains within gene clusters that are highly homologous. These domain sets are more likely to be mutually interoperable than domain sets chosen at random, and might therefore be of great utility in future engineering efforts.</p>
<p>Also, evolutionary strategies towards generating larger and more complex compounds could be mimicked by N-terminally extending certain types of NRPS/PKS gene clusters by duplicating and then carefully modifying the first assembly-line module.</p>

Next, we calculated a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (correlation coefficient) for each possible pair of protein domains (rows), resulting into a new matrix, a correlation matrix, of the size corresponding to the number of protein domains (rows from the initial array) in both dimensions. To take rearrangements into account, we reordered rows and columns of the correlation matrix based on hierarchical clustering of the correlation matrix in both dimensions. We then parsed linear motifs that are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion by selecting consecutive pairs of domains in this reordered correlation matrix (consecutive fields on the first offset diagonal) with correlation coefficient &gt;0.5. The analysis was repeated by setting the correlation coefficient cutoff to &gt;0.65 and &gt;0.8. Each motif was divided into all possible sub-motifs of sizes between 2 domains and the total number of domains in a motif.

Finally, duplications were defined as 1-kb blocks that had the best hit towards another block in its own gene cluster, and having a higher copy number in one gene cluster than in the other, such as when A1-A2-A3-A2-A3-A4-A5 aligns to B1-B2-B3-B4-B5, while the mutual sequence identity between the A2 and A3 pairs is higher than between any of the A2/A3 blocks and B2 or B3.</p>

A BGC sequence similarity index was defined as the Jaccard index with the size of the intersection represented by the number of Pfam pairs whose sequence identities were higher than the best 10% alignments of all Pfam domains of the same Pfam ID. Taking into account the underlying distributions of sequence identities between all domain sequences prevented misinterpretation of simpler sequence similarity metrics (e.g., an absolute sequence identity threshold) when different evolutionary rates apply to different protein families. We define structural similarity of a given BGC product pair as the Tanimoto coefficient between the two SMILES strings, using linear-path fingerprints (FP2) from Open Babel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-OBoyle1">[67]</xref>.</p>

<title>Sub-cluster analysis of known gene clusters</title>
<p>Sub-clusters with known functions from experimentally characterized gene clusters were manually collected from the literature. Sub-cluster sharing between gene clusters from the training set was calculated using blastp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Camacho1">[68]</xref>. The minimum requirement used to identify a shared sub-cluster between two BGCs was sharing either 75% of the genes with &gt;45% average sequence identity, 50% of the genes with &gt;50% average sequence identity, or 25% of the genes with 70% identity. To account for different modes of sequence evolution of different sub-cluster types, these values were adjusted with sub-cluster type-specific cutoffs to obtain a good match between genetic similarity and chemical similarity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004016.s014">Table S3</xref></bold>). The final sub-cluster sharing network was drawn with Cytoscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004016-Smoot1">[69]</xref>.</p>

<title>Multimodular NRPS/PKS gene cluster evolution</title>
<p>To study patterns of evolution in multimodular NRPS and PKS gene clusters, a range of features was calculated describing key characteristics of these gene clusters. The first set of features was based on the topologies of intra-BGC domain similarity networks (with protein domains and sequence similarity representing nodes and edges, respectively) and consisted of the average clustering coefficient, average sequence similarity, graph transitivity, number of 2–4 node cliques, number of connected components in a graph with sequence similarity &gt;50%, and average neighbor degree. We also included as features the number of different Pfam domain types in a BGC, the total number of domains in a BGC, the average number of domains per gene, and the averages and standard errors of best-matching pair sequence identities and internal BGC similarity indices. Two evolutionary indices were also added: the internal similarity index and the vertical evolution index. To obtain the internal similarity index of a gene cluster, we calculated for each of its NRPS/PKS domains the <italic>p</italic>-value of its closest blastp match inside the gene cluster, given the distribution of the percent identities of all within-gene-cluster blastp hits of all domains of that domain type in the complete set of gene clusters. The internal similarity index was then calculated from these numbers as the mean of all inverse <italic>p</italic>-values. The same inverse <italic>p</italic>-values were used for plotting the internal domain similarity across gene clusters. The vertical evolution index of a gene cluster was calculated as the average difference between the <italic>p</italic>-value of the top 10 percent identities of a domain's blastp hits to all domains from other gene clusters with the <italic>p</italic>-values of the Lin distances of the gene clusters to the host gene clusters of each of the top 10 hit domains. Consequently, gene clusters with domains with highly similar closest hits to domains in dissimilar gene clusters get a low value, while gene clusters with domains with dissimilar closest hits to domains in similar gene clusters get a high value.</p>
<p>PCA analysis was performed with the aforementioned features as an input. Compound types were assigned using the classifications taken from the primary literature.</p>

<p><bold>Examples of insertions/deletions in BGCs.</bold> Three gene cluster alignments of highly similar BGCs (&gt;70% at the nucleotide level) are shown that are likely to represent relatively recent insertions/deletions in BGCs with functional consequences. In the upper panel, genes that putatively encode one or more sugar moieties have been inserted/deleted from a saccharide biosynthesis gene cluster. In the middle panel, a germacradienol synthase has been replaced by another type of terpene synthase, a pentalenene synthase, as well as an AMP-dependent synthetase. In the lower panel, a gene cluster related to the well-known coelibactin gene cluster from <italic>Saccharopolyspora spinosa</italic> is shown, which has acquired a MSAS polyketide synthase, a cytochrome P450, a carboxamide synthase and a 3-oxoacyl-(ACP) synthase compared to the coelibactin gene cluster from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>.
