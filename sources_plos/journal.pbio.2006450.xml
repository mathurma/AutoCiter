<abstract>
<p>Biological processes in living cells are often carried out by gene networks in which signals and reactions are integrated through network hubs. Despite their functional importance, it remains unclear to what extent network hubs are evolvable and how alterations impact long-term evolution. We investigated these issues using heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a central hub of proteostasis networks. When native Hsp90 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells was replaced by the ortholog from hypersaline-tolerant <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> that diverged from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> about 270 million years ago, the cells exhibited improved growth in hypersaline environments but compromised growth in others, indicating functional divergence in Hsp90 between the two yeasts. Laboratory evolution shows that evolved <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic>-<italic>HSP90</italic>–carrying <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells exhibit a wider range of phenotypic variation than cells carrying native Hsp90. Identified beneficial mutations are involved in multiple pathways and are often pleiotropic. Our results show that cells adapt to a heterologous Hsp90 by modifying different subnetworks, facilitating the evolution of phenotypic diversity inaccessible to wild-type cells.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Biological processes in living cells are often carried out by gene networks. Hubs are highly connected network components important for integrating signal inputs and generating responsive functional outputs. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a versatile hub in the protein homeostasis network, is a molecular chaperone essential for cell viability in all tested eukaryotic cells. In yeast, about a quarter of the expressed proteins are profoundly influenced when Hsp90 activity is reduced. Despite its pivotal role, we found that the function of Hsp90 has diverged between two yeast species, <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which split about 270 million years ago. To understand the impacts and adaptive strategies in cells with an altered network hub, we conducted laboratory evolution experiments using a <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strain in which native Hsp90 is replaced by its counterpart in <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic>. We observed different fitness gain or loss under various stress conditions in individual evolved clones, suggesting that cells adapted via different evolutionary paths. Genome sequencing and mutation reconstitution experiments show that beneficial mutations occurred in multiple Hsp90-related pathways that interact with each other. Our results show that a perturbed network allows cells to evolve a broader range of phenotypic diversity unavailable to wild-type cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biological functions are often considered the collective output of genes interacting coordinately in a network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref004">4</xref>]. Although most genes in a network only have a few links, some “hub” genes are highly connected to network components and play a vital role in maintaining intra-network connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref002">2</xref>]. As a consequence, hub genes usually possess pleiotropic functions and have a profound influence on cell fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref006">6</xref>]. Phenotypic variation was enhanced in yeast cells in which hub genes were disrupted, revealing a role for hub genes in network robustness against genetic or environmental perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref007">7</xref>]. Comparative genomics has shown that some hub genes can diverge significantly at the sequence level. However, little is known about to what extent the function of hub genes can change over long-term evolution or how changes in hub genes influence the evolutionary trajectory of an entire network.</p>
<p>The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) represents a well-documented network hub. Hsp90 is present in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref008">8</xref>] and is essential for cell viability in all studied eukaryotic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref013">13</xref>]. Large-scale studies in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> indicate that Hsp90 is one of the central hubs in both physical and genetic interaction networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref015">15</xref>]. More than 10% of the whole yeast and human proteomes have been shown to be clients of Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover, the yeast Hsp90-dependent proteome is enriched with other hubs and essential genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>In general, Hsp90 acts at a late stage of protein folding. It assists partially folded clients to reach structural maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref016">16</xref>], or it stabilizes the components of multi-subunit protein complexes and facilitates their assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref020">20</xref>]. Hsp90 has a high degree of specificity for client recognition, which is attributed to its sophisticated co-chaperone system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref022">22</xref>]. Interestingly, it has been found that the activity or stability of some Hsp90 client proteins can become Hsp90 independent after introducing mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref024">24</xref>], suggesting that the link between Hsp90 and its clients may be changed over time.</p>
<p>Apart from these physiological functions, Hsp90 has been suggested to buffer genetic and nongenetic variations to ensure developmental stability in fungi, plants, and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref028">28</xref>]. Organisms exhibit constant phenotypes under normal conditions, even if they host genetic or nongenetic variations. However, when Hsp90 activity is compromised or titrated by extreme environmental stresses, heterogeneous phenotypes are revealed in a population. This increased phenotypic diversity is hypothesized to help the population survive or adapt during drastic environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>To understand the implications of hub evolution, we replaced the Hsp90-coding gene of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> with orthologs from other yeast species and examined their functions. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells carrying <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica-</italic>Hsp90 (Ylip-Hsp90) exhibited decreased fitness in most tested conditions but improved growth in high-salt medium, suggesting that the function of Ylip-Hsp90 has differentiated from its <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> ortholog. We further evolved the Ylip-Hsp90–hosting strain to study how cells respond to a changed network hub. The evolved clones adopted various evolutionary trajectories, but none involved changing the heterologous Hsp90 per se. Furthermore, fitness measurements in different stress environments showed that these clones had evolved diverged phenotypes that differed from each other and also deviated from wild-type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells.</p>

<title>Replacing an essential hub gene <italic>HSP90</italic> with the <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> ortholog increases salt tolerance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells</title>
<p>Hsp90 is an essential hub protein that interacts with 10%–20% of the whole yeast proteome, and changes to Hsp90 are probably constrained by the function of its client proteins or even the network structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref016">16</xref>]. To investigate whether Hsp90 protein function has changed during evolution, we replaced the endogenous Hsp90 gene in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> with the plasmids carrying its orthologs from <italic>Naumovozyma castellii</italic> (Ncas), <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> (Klac), and <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> (Ylip), which diverged from the common ancestor of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (Scer) at different times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref031">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Our previous data showed that the original promoters of the orthologs from distant species often do not function properly in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells. Therefore, we placed the coding sequences of <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> (one of the genes encoding Hsp90 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>) and its orthologous genes under a strong tetracycline operator 7 repeats (<italic>TetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub>) promoter, which enabled us to study changes in protein function and to also control expression levels. We then examined these Hsp90-ortholog replacement strains (denominated as <italic>Ncas-HSP90</italic>, <italic>Klac-HSP90</italic>, and <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic>) under different growth conditions.</p>

<p>To examine how orthologous Hsp90 proteins influence the physiology of hosting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strains, we measured the fitness of replacement strains under 17 different growth conditions using spot assays (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). For most test conditions, Ncas-Hsp90 and Klac-Hsp90 hosting strains exhibited similar fitness as Scer-Hsc82–carrying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s009">S1 Table</xref>), indicating that the function of Hsp90 is not drastically different among <italic>N</italic>. <italic>castellii</italic>, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. In contrast, the Ylip-Hsp90 hosting strain exhibited lower fitness than Scer-Hsc82 cells under most conditions; similar fitness to Scer-Hsc82 cells in media containing 150 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 M sorbitol, or 0.5 M NaCl; and higher fitness under two hypersaline conditions (media containing 1 M NaCl or 0.2 M LiCl, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s009">S1 Table</xref>). The phenotypic differences between Ylip-Hsp90– and Scer-Hsc82–carrying cells might be due to differences in the expression level, activity, or/and specificity of these two orthologs. No significant difference was observed when the protein levels of Ylip-Hsp90 and Scer-Hsc82 were measured using western blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). To test whether the activity of Ylip-Hsp90 is different than that of Scer-Hsc82, we performed a v-src kinase assay. Hsp90 is required for the activation of v-src and, therefore, by measuring the level of v-src–dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, the activity of Hsp90 can be estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref032">32</xref>]. In the kinase assay, we observed similar levels of v-src–dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in Ylip-Hsp90– and Scer-Hsc82–carrying cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), suggesting that the main difference between Ylip-Hsp90 and Scer-Hsc82 is the interaction specificity instead of the activity.</p>
<p><italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> cells are often isolated from hypersaline environments and exhibit high tolerance to NaCl and LiCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s002">S2C Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref034">34</xref>]. Previous research in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> suggested that Hsp90 plays a crucial role in salt stress tolerance by regulating the activity of its client, calcineurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref035">35</xref>]. Hsp90 is essential for activation of calcineurin. However, overexpression of Hsp90 also led to salt hypersensitivity because calcineurin was sequestered by Hsp90. The increased salt resistance in Ylip-Hsp90 hosting cells suggests that the interaction between Ylip-Hsp90 and calcineurin may have been changed or Ylip-Hsp90 can facilitate the activity of other proteins involved in hypersaline growth. The altered growth pattern of Ylip-Hsp90 hosting cells reveals that the function of Hsp90 has significantly diverged between <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Moreover, our findings indicate that even a central network hub like Hsp90 can change significantly over the course of long-term evolution.</p>

<title>Adaptation to a heterologous Hsp90 in laboratory evolution experiments</title>
<p>Alteration of a network hub often has a strong impact on cell fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref006">6</xref>]. Cells may be selected to quickly restore the original functions of the hub, or the network may be rewired to accommodate or compensate for the altered hub. In the latter scenario, it may also open the possibility for cells to evolve novel phenotypes. To explore the possible evolutionary trajectories of an altered Hsp90 network, we evolved 12 independent haploid lines carrying <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> and 12 control lines carrying <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> that were all derived from the same parental <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clone. These cell lines were grown in regular rich medium (Yeast extract-Peptone-Dextrose [YPD]) at 28°C so that their major selective pressure is to restore the general growth defects caused by <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic>. In each evolving culture, two isogenic strains carrying either the green or red fluorescent protein marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) were mixed at an approximate initial ratio of 1:1. By monitoring the proportions of the two fluorescence-labeled populations at different time points, we could estimate when the first beneficial mutation was fixed in each culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In the <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> lines, more than half of the cultures fixed the first beneficial mutation within 450 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). It took another 200 generations for the <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> lines to reach similar proportions of fixation. This outcome is consistent with the assumption that <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> hosting cells were initially under high selective pressure to resolve the incompatibility between the heterologous Ylip-Hsp90 and its interactive network in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> background. In contrast, the <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> lines only experienced very low or no selective pressure, because the evolution experiments were conducted under a normal growth condition.</p>

Two isogenic subpopulations (red: DsRed-labeled subpopulation; green: GFP-labeled subpopulation) were mixed in an approximate ratio of 1:1 in the initial cultures.

The mutation fixation of each culture was determined as the time when the frequency of a subpopulation was observed to be greater than 95% according to flow cytometry.

<p>After evolving for around 2,200 generations, three <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> (evo1, evo2, and evo12) lines and one <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> (con6) line were lost because of contamination. We further analyzed the remaining evolved cultures. The fitness of evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> populations in YPD at 28°C improved by 16%–24% compared with their ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The degree of improvement was significantly higher than that observed in the evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> populations, suggesting that the adaptive phenotype is likely to be <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> specific. When the fitness of evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones was compared with their ancestor, no significant difference was observed in four evolved lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s010">S2 Table</xref>), suggesting that both genetic drift and beneficial mutations contributed to the evolved phenotypes of <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> populations.</p>
<p>To characterize the evolved phenotype, we isolated three single colonies from each evolved culture and measured their fitness. The colonies with the highest fitness from each population were chosen to represent the lineage for further examination (denominated E3 to E11 for evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones and C1 to C12 for evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones). It was previously reported that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells often converge to a diploid state during laboratory evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref036">36</xref>]. We examined the genome content of evolved clones using flow cytometry and found that all of the evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones had become diploid or triploid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). In contrast, most of the evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones remained haploid, except for E10, which had become diploid. To ensure that the ploidy expansion observed in individual clones is representative of the whole population, we also examined the evolved cultures using flow cytometry and observed the same results. Because all the cultures were evolved under the same selective regime, the difference in ploidy observed in evolved cultures further implicates functional divergence between Ylip-Hsp90 and Scer-Hsc82. To further test the effect of Hsp90 on ploidy expansion or maintenance, we generated diploid strains by mating haploid cells and compared their fitness with haploid strains. Haploid <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic>–carrying cells exhibited higher fitness than diploid <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic>–carrying cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). This result provides the possible reason why most <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> lines remained haploid after evolution.</p>

<p>The function of Ylip-Hsp90 might be enhanced if its expression level is increased or the protein is mutated in the evolved clones.

<p>The observed fitness improvement in evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones might be specific to the heterologous Hsp90 or simply be due to mutations that enhance general cell proliferation (e.g., loss of the costly genes or gain of glucose uptake genes).

<title>Protein homeostasis improves to varying degrees in individual evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones</title>
<p>Because Hsp90 is an important molecular chaperone involved in maintaining protein homeostasis, we suspected that the reduced fitness of ancestral <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> cells in normal conditions might reflect disturbed internal proteostasis caused by the compromised Hsp90 network. We used an Hsp104 aggregation assay to investigate this possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref037">37</xref>]. Hsp104 is a disaggregase that localizes to protein aggregates upon heat stress and helps with the disaggregation and refolding process. Ancestral and evolved cells containing fluorescent Hsp104-BFP fusion protein were first grown at 25°C and then shifted to 37°C for high-temperature adaptation. By monitoring the fraction of cells containing Hsp104-BFP foci during heat treatment, we could assess how well protein homeostasis is maintained.</p>
<p>Ancestral <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> cells contained more Hsp104-BFP foci than <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> cells before and during heat treatment, suggesting that <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> cells indeed have a high endogenous proteome burden even before heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, even though all evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones had improved their fitness to the wild-type level, not all of them could restore their ability to efficiently clear protein aggregates. E11 cells exhibited a disaggregation pattern similar to ancestral <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> cells. In contrast, E7 cells had lower levels of Hsp104-BFP foci at initial and later time points compared with <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). Our results suggest that different evolved lines probably took different paths to fix the compromised Hsp90 network.</p>
<p>In addition to attenuated protein homeostasis, ancestral <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> cells also exhibited an elongated cell morphology that has previously been observed in cells lacking sufficient Hsp90 activity to stabilize its client proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref028">28</xref>]. When we examined the cell morphology of evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones, we found that only E3, E4, and E9 cells recovered from the elongated cell morphology. E5 and E11 evolved to an even more elongated form, whereas the remaining clones were not significantly different than their ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).

For many of the conditions, some evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones display enhanced fitness compared with <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones. Individual fitness values were divided by the mean of all fitness values in the same condition to normalize the fitness data to a similar scale between conditions.

<p>To obtain a more general overview of the evolved features in different clones, we performed hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) according to their fitness measurements under the 11 tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s006">S6A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s012">S4 Table</xref>). Hierarchical clustering revealed that clones E4 and E9 were more similar to <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> cells than other evolved clones. The first principal component (explaining 33.8% of the variance) of our PCA showed that most clones evolved toward the <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Nonetheless, they were not closely clustered. Phenotypic divergence between the evolved clones was further revealed by the second and third principal components (explaining 28.4% and 14.2% of the variance, respectively). These results suggest that <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> lines have evolved diverged phenotypes that both differ from each other and from ancestor and <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> cells.</p>
<p>The observed phenotypic variation in the evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones suggests that after the heterologous Hsp90 was introduced, different Hsp90-related functions in individual evolving lines were modified to regain fitness. Under this hypothesis, high phenotypic variation should not occur in the evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones (i.e., the control lines), because the network hub has not changed. We performed two types of analysis to address this issue.</p>
<p>We first measured the fitness of evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones under the same 11 growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s006">S6B Fig</xref>) and calculated the variance of fitness improvements among evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> and <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones in individual conditions. We then compared the variance between evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> and <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> groups. The data show that the evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones exhibited greater variance than the evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> group (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.039, one-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test), indicating that responses of evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones to different stress conditions were more varied than evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s006">S6C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second analysis, we calculated the Pearson correlation distances between fitness levels under different conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s013">S5 Table</xref>) to quantify the variation in distribution patterns of individual fitness between each pair of conditions. If individual clones show similar ranking patterns for fitness between two conditions, Pearson correlation distances will be small. In contrast, large Pearson correlation distances indicate that individual evolved clones behave very differently in two conditions. Overall, pairwise comparisons revealed that the evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones behaved similarly under different stress conditions, except for the complete supplement mixture (CSM) and azetidine-2-carboxylate (AZC) media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s013">S5 Table</xref>). The stress condition–based phenotypic distance of evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones is significantly smaller than that of evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s006">S6D Fig</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that high phenotypic variation only occurred in evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones.</p>

<title>Segregant analysis identifies beneficial mutations with strong fitness effects</title>
<p>Not all the mutations in the evolved clones are likely to contribute equally to the adaptive phenotypes. We performed segregant analysis to map the mutations with strong effects in three evolved clones (E4, E5 and E7). These clones were selected because E4 and E5 clones showed opposite trends in cell morphology, and E7 has the largest improvement in protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones were backcrossed to the ancestral <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> strain and their F1 spores (from 40–45 four-viable spore tetrads) were analyzed. In all three evolved clones, our genetic analysis indicated that multiple loci were involved in the evolved phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s017">S9 Table</xref>). The F1 progeny with phenotypes similar to evolved or ancestral clones were grouped into good and bad spore pools, respectively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). Genomic DNA was isolated from both pools and then subjected to Illumina sequencing.</p>
<p>Based on our computational simulation, two criteria were used to select the mutations with strong effects: (1) the mutation frequency in the good spore pool is greater than 70% or (2) the difference in mutation frequencies between good and bad spore pools is greater than 45%. Nine mutations—<italic>sec9-E310K</italic> and <italic>tap42-F72S</italic> from E4; <italic>izh3-S115*</italic> (* indicating a premature stop codon), <italic>bud4-P981fs</italic> (<italic>fs</italic> indicating a frameshift mutation), <italic>bre5-L433F</italic>, and <italic>mdm12</italic>-<italic>F148S</italic> from E5; and <italic>siz1-P401L</italic>, <italic>pbp1-N318fs</italic>, and <italic>nop53-E289_N290insE</italic> (<italic>ins</italic> indicating an insertion) from E7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s018">S10 Table</xref>)—were identified and used for reconstitution experiments to confirm their effects.</p>

<title>Individual mutations exert condition-specific effects</title>
<p>Our phenotypic assays had revealed that independent <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> lines evolved diverse phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g004">Fig 4</xref>). To understand how the evolved mutations contribute to the broad spectrum of phenotypes, we used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system to reintroduce these mutations into the ancestral <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> strain and examined the fitness of these mutants under different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s016">S8 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s019">S11 Table</xref>). Four major conclusions can be drawn from the phenotypic assays. First, individual mutations usually had dominant effects under at least one stress condition (e.g., in clone E7, the <italic>siz1</italic>, <italic>pbp1</italic>, and <italic>nop53</italic> mutants exhibited strongest effects under conditions of 37°C, macbecin II treatment, and doxycycline treatment, respectively), confirming that these mutations really contribute to the evolved phenotypes. Second, several mutations exhibited positive effects under one stress condition but negative effects under others (e.g., in clone E7, <italic>pbp1</italic> mutants had a positive effect under macbecin II treatment but a negative effect under the MG132 stress condition), indicating that antagonistic pleiotropy is common among the evolved mutations. Third, in a few stress conditions (e.g., for clone E5 in medium containing macbecin II), the sum of individual effects exceeded the effect observed in the evolved clone, suggesting the existence of negative epistasis between mutations. Fourth, for some other conditions (e.g., clone E4 in medium containing MG132), the sum of all individual effects was still far below the effect observed in evolved clones. This outcome can be explained if there is positive epistasis between mutations. Alternatively, some mutations with weak individual effects but that are strongly epistatic to other mutations might have been missed by our mapping exercise. We selected one mutation from the E4 clone, <italic>cbk1-L461F</italic>, that exhibited a mutation frequency slightly lower than our segregant analysis criteria to test these possibilities. The <italic>cbk1-L461F</italic> single mutation did not result in any significant effects under any tested stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). However, when <italic>cbk1-L461F</italic> was combined with <italic>sec9-E310K</italic> or <italic>tap42-F72S</italic> and tested in all conditions, it displayed positive epistatic effects with <italic>sec9-E310K</italic> and <italic>tap42-F72S</italic> in medium containing brefeldin A (BFA) and MG132, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s019">S11 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to its fitness improvement, our Hsp104 aggregation assay showed that the E7 clone has a strong aggregate clearance phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Hsp90 network performs many crucial functions in eukaryotic cells and probably represents a robust system resilient to genetic perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref040">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, the ability of Ylip-Hsp90 to enhance hypersaline tolerance in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells and the compromised fitness of such cells under other stress conditions indicate that even a central hub like Hsp90 can change its functions or partners during evolution. This seeming discrepancy may be explained by a computational simulation study of complex signaling circuits that showed phenotypic robustness and variability are positively correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref042">42</xref>]. Because a broad range of genotypes usually supports a robust phenotype, a greater diversity of phenotypes is accessible from among the genotypic neighborhood. This model implies that a robust system like the Hsp90 network can still be genetically adjusted to facilitate adaptation to novel environments. If the Hsp90 network is continually modified in a specific direction (e.g., to tolerate hypersaline stress), it may eventually lead to alterations in a network hub such as Ylip-Hsp90.</p>
<p>Evolvability represents an organism’s capacity to generate selectable phenotypic traits during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref043">43</xref>], so the level of evolvability may influence the likelihood of an organism surviving in or adapting to a new habitat. In developmental biology, large phenotypic changes or innovations are often associated with changes in the transcriptional network hubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref046">46</xref>]. Despite strong evidence supporting a link between network hubs and evolvability, it is difficult to study directly the effect of changed network hubs on evolutionary trajectories using natural populations. Our laboratory evolution experiments provide an alternative approach to address this issue. In the current study, we replaced the Hsp90-coding gene of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> with the ortholog from a distant species. Nonetheless, a similar evolutionary process may occur in nature under the following conditions: (1) a hybrid progeny carries incompatible gene pairs that compromise the function of a network hub. Genetic incompatibility has been observed to exist between closely related species and cause defects in different important cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref047">47</xref>]. Although these types of hybrids have lower fitness and are likely to be eliminated in most cases, they may also create the chance for the organism to evolve new phenotypes, especially in the hybrid zone where hybrids are constantly generated. (2) Mutations occur in critical domains of a hub gene. Mutagenesis experiments in Hsp90 have shown that even a single amino acid change can alter the activity or interacting partners of the protein completely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref048">48</xref>]. Such mutations will often result in the low fitness of the cell, as in the hybrid case. However, they may lead to the evolution of new phenotypes if compensatory mutations that restore fitness occur and are subsequently fixed by selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref049">49</xref>]. (3) A multifunctional gene is obtained through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In recent years, HGT has been shown to occur frequently, even in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref051">51</xref>]. A foreign multifunctional protein may disturb the original cellular network and open a new evolutionary path.</p>
<p>Network structures contribute to phenotypic robustness against genetic or environmental perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref052">52</xref>]. When network hubs are compromised, pre-existing cryptic genetic or nongenetic variation may be exposed that facilitates short-term population adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref007">7</xref>]. Our study reveals a different role played by network hubs in long-term evolution in a population without much genetic variation. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells immediately gained hypersaline tolerance like <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> cells solely by replacing a single hub gene, <italic>HSP90</italic>, with the corresponding ortholog. This is similar to a previous observation that bacteria dramatically increased the growth rate at lower temperatures with the introduction of psychrophilic chaperonins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref053">53</xref>]. Moreover, the novel Hsp90 allowed individual clonal populations to evolve diverse phenotypes unobserved in cells hosting native Scer-Hsc82. These novel phenotypes may enable evolved cells to explore niches inaccessible to Scer-Hsc82–hosting cells and, in the long term, may broaden opportunities for population diversification and speciation.</p>
<p>Previous laboratory evolution experiments in bacteria showed that when essential ribosomal genes or translation factors were replaced by their orthologs from other bacteria or the ancestral sequence, expression levels of the introduced orthologous genes were often amplified to compensate for the incompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref056">56</xref>]. In our evolved clones, protein levels of Ylip-Hsp90 were not changed, suggesting that the cells were able to quickly gain other mutations to ameliorate the growth defect in the conditions under which they evolved. One major function of network hubs is to coordinate different subnetworks (or pathways) so that the cell can quickly respond to environmental changes. However, when a hub is compromised or altered (such as in the Ylip-Hsp90–hosting cells), any mutation that can improve cell fitness under the existing growth conditions will be selected, even if it has costs in other conditions or distorts the balance between different subnetworks. The evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones restored only some of the functions of Hsp90 despite that all clones had similar or higher fitness in rich medium compared to <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g003">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g003">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g004">4</xref>).</p>
<p>By sequencing the evolved clones and reconstituting mutations, we confirmed that individual subnetworks of Hsp90 had been modified in different evolved lineages. As expected, some of the evolved mutations showed strong antagonistic pleiotropy, exhibiting improved cell fitness in rich medium but growth defects under other stress conditions. Because cells are constantly challenged by environmental fluctuations, it is likely that another layer of compensatory mutations can be selected to resolve the fitness conflict of pleiotropic mutations under different conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref057">57</xref>]. These compensatory mutations may not exhibit adaptive effects by themselves but will be epistatic to the previous pleiotropic mutations. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by our reconstitution experiments, which showed that intergenic epistasis is common among the evolved mutations. After obtaining compensatory mutations, modified subnetworks are likely to stay in the lineage and to have a long-term influence on evolutionary paths.</p>
<p>The fact that no mutations occurred in the <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> gene indicates a strong constraint on the hub, probably due to pleiotropic effects. Therefore, evolved cells resolved the fitness conflict through modifying the functions or structures of some subnetworks. Similar processes have been observed in the evolution of transcription networks. Although different species may share the same transcription factors, the downstream targets of the orthologs could have been rewired greatly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref059">59</xref>]. Previous studies of digital organisms have suggested that deleterious mutations might act as stepping stones for the evolution of complex phenotypes inaccessible to the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref061">61</xref>]. Our study provides direct evidence that diverse phenotypes can evolve when an essential network hub is altered. Robust networks are often connected to a larger phenotypic space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref042">42</xref>]. An initial adaptation to a changed or compromised network hub allows a cell to reshape its network structures in different directions, which further broadens its evolutionary potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Construction of the HSP90 replacement strains</title>
<p>All the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strains were derived from R1158 (JYL1821) containing the tTA transactivator with the CMV promoter that allows us to down-regulate the expression level of the <italic>TetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub> promoter–containing gene by adding doxycycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref062">62</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the essential function of Hsp90 is performed by two highly similar and functionally redundant genes, <italic>HSC82</italic> and <italic>HSP82</italic> (protein identity and similarity are 0.969 and 0.987, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref009">9</xref>]. We first generated the HSP90 plasmid shuffling strain (JYL1827) in which both <italic>HSC82</italic> and <italic>HSP82</italic> were deleted, and the essential Hsp90 functions were performed by an <italic>HSC82</italic>-containing plasmid (pRS416-<italic>Scer-HSC82</italic>). The coding regions of <italic>HSC82</italic> and its orthologs were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA or cDNA of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>castellii</italic>, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>, or <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>lipolytica</italic> and cloned into a plasmid (pRS413-pTetO<sub>7</sub>) containing the <italic>kan</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup><italic>-TetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub><italic>-TATA</italic><sub><italic>CYC1</italic></sub> cassette from RP188 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref063">63</xref>]. These ortholog-containing plasmids were then transformed into the shuffling strain to replace pRS416-<italic>Scer-HSC82</italic>. The ortholog-replacement strains were checked using PCR to confirm the loss of pRS416-<italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> and are denominated as JYL5001 (<italic>Scer-HSC82</italic>), JYL1831 (<italic>Ncas-HSP90</italic>), JYL1833 (<italic>Klac-HSP90</italic>), and JYL1835 (<italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic>). In our experiments, the orthologs of Hsp90 were all carried by the plasmid so they could be easily shuffled to check whether the observed effects are ortholog specific.</p>

<title>Experimental evolution</title>
<p>For the evolution experiment, JYL5001 and JYL1835 were transformed with HindIII-linearized GFP (pGS62) and DsRED (pGS64) integration plasmid DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref064">64</xref>] to generate green and red fluorescent protein-labeled ancestral strains. We mixed the two colored subpopulations of <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> or <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> cells in an approximate ratio of 1:1 to establish starting cultures and then divided them into 12 evolving and 12 control lines. These cell lines were grown in YPD medium at 28°C through a daily 1,000-fold dilution (about 10 generations) with an effective population size of 4.69 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells on the first 140 days and 2.79 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells after day 140. The effective population size was estimated using the formula, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> = <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> × <italic>g</italic>, in which <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> is the initial population size and <italic>g</italic> is the number of generations during a single cycle of growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref065">65</xref>]. We tracked the proportion of the green and red subpopulations in each lineage using the BD LSR II system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Fixation of the evolved culture is defined when either the green or red subpopulation reaches a population frequency of 95%.</p>

<title>Cell fitness assays</title>
<p>For the fitness spot assay on plates, around 10<sup>3</sup> cells were taken from overnight cell cultures growing in YPD at 28°C and spotted onto the plates following 10-fold serial dilutions. Plates were then incubated at specified temperatures until individual colonies became visible. Colony size and cell density were used to estimate the cell fitness and survival rate for each condition. For the fitness assay in liquid, overnight cell cultures growing in YPD at 28°C were inoculated into 120 μL fresh medium in 96-well tissue culture plates at an initial concentration of 0.1 OD<sub>595</sub>, and cell densities (OD<sub>595</sub>) were measured every 10 minutes using Infinite 200 series plate readers (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) with a shaking cycle (1 minute shaking and 3 minutes standing) until the culture reached diauxic shift. Growth rates (OD<sub>595</sub>/hour) of the sample were calculated using the 10-point sliding window, and the maximal growth rate was used to represent the fitness value. Fitness improvement compared with ancestors was calculated as (F<sub>x</sub>/F<sub>a</sub>−1) × 100%, where F<sub>x</sub> is the fitness value of evolved or reconstituted clones and F<sub>a</sub> is the fitness value of the ancestral strain.</p>
<p>In order to uncover the functional differentiation between Hsp90 orthologs, the ortholog-replacement strains were examined under YPD at 28°C and 16 other conditions, including 0.015% or 0.03% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 μM CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, 0.3 μM tunicamycin (cat. no. T7765, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 5 mM guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), pH 5 or pH 9, 1 μg/mL doxycycline (cat. no. D9891, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 or 1 M NaCl, 0.2 M LiCl, 16°C, 34°C, or 37°C, and 1.8 M sorbitol. Chemicals were added into YPD to prepare media for specific conditions. Liquid fitness assays were used in all measurements.</p>
<p>To characterize the evolved phenotypes, we measured the fitness of evolved clones under nine different stress conditions: AZC (cat. no. A0760, Sigma-Aldrich), a proline analog that can be incorporated into newly synthesized proteins and cause failure in folding or structural instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref067">67</xref>]; cycloheximide (CYH, cat. no. C7698, Sigma-Aldrich), which inhibits the 80S ribosome from translating mRNA into proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref068">68</xref>]; BFA (cat. no. B6542, Sigma-Aldrich), which blocks protein trafficking and affects the central vacuolar secretory pathway, resulting in ER/Golgi membrane mixing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref069">69</xref>] and an unfolded protein response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref070">70</xref>]; high temperature (37°C) and ethanol (EtOH), which induce protein misfolding and change the membrane protein composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref071">71</xref>]; doxycycline, which reduces the expression level of Hsp90 orthologs; GuHCl, which inhibits the disaggregase activity of Hsp104 and reduces cell thermotolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref072">72</xref>]; MG132 (cat. no. C2211, Sigma-Aldrich), a compound that inhibits protein degradation by blocking proteasome activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref073">73</xref>]; and macbecin II (MacII, cat. no. NSC 330500, NIH, Bethesda, MD), which is a compound that inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp90. CSM at 28°C was a suboptimal condition. Apart from CSM, as well as MG132 that was added to synthetic medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate supplemented with 0.1% proline, amino acids, 2% glucose, and 0.003% SDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref074">74</xref>], all these chemicals were added into YPD medium. Liquid fitness assays were used in all measurements.</p>

<title>Western blotting for measuring the abundance of Hsp90</title>
<p>We constructed pRS413-<italic>pTetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub><italic>-TAP-Scer-HSC82</italic> and pRS413-<italic>pTetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub><italic>-TAP-Ylip-HSP90</italic> plasmids, in which a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag was fused to the N-terminus of the Hsp90 protein.

<title>V-src kinase assay</title>
<p>Ancestral <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> and <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> strains were first transformed with the plasmid Y316v-srcv5 containing v-src with a C-terminal V5 tag under a galactose-regulated promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref076">76</xref>]. Cells were then maintained on 2% glucose CSM-Ura plates to prevent the expression of v-src. Before the experiment, cells were grown to log phase in 2% glucose CSM-Ura liquid cultures, transferred to 2% raffinose CSM-Ura, and then grown to about 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 2% galactose CSM-Ura, and grown for 6 hours to induce the expression of v-src. The whole experiment was carried out at 28°C. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, and lysed with the NaOH-lysis method. Total protein extracts were mixed with the sample buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, and 2% 2-Mercaptoethanol) and boiled at 100°C for 5 minutes. The anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody 4G10 (cat. no. 05–321, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA) was used to detect phosphorylated tyrosine residues, and the anti-V5-Tag antibody (cat. no. MCA1360, BioRad, Hercules, CA) was used to detect the v-src protein.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry of DNA content</title>
<p>Flow cytometry was used to determine the DNA content of ancestral and evolved cells. Total 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> log-phase cells were harvested, resuspended in ice-cold fixation buffer (40% ethanol, 0.1 M sorbitol, and 5 mM EDTA), and then kept at −20°C overnight. The fixed cells were then washed twice with 1 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O and then washed with 1 mL PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing, the cells were treated with 0.5 mL 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) with 150 μg/mL RNase A and incubated at 37°C for 16–18 hours. SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 38 mM sodium citrate were mixed in a 1:800 ratio, and 300 μL of the mixture was added into the cell solution. The stained cells were diluted into 1 mL 0.1 M EDTA and sonicated for at least 3 minutes prior to flow cytometry. A total of 10,000 cells were scored for DNA content using the BD FACScan system (Becton Dickinson). The E10 clone was excluded from further examination because of its altered ploidy.</p>

<title>Hsp104 aggregation assay</title>
<p>A blue fluorescence protein (BFP) cassette was amplified from the pFA6a-link-yomTagBFP2-Kan plasmid and integrated into the genome to generate an Hsp104-BFP fusion protein in all tested strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref077">77</xref>]. Log-phase cells growing in YPD at 25°C were transferred to a 37°C water bath and cells were collected at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours after the temperature shift. The samples were resuspended in 200 μL PBS and transferred to a Glass Bottom ViewPlate-96F (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) that was precoated with concanavalin A (cat. no. C2010, Sigma-Aldrich).

<title>Hierarchical clustering and PCA</title>
<p>For hierarchical clustering, we divided individual fitness values by the mean of all fitness values for the same stress condition to normalize fitness data to a similar scale between conditions. We applied a hierarchical clustering method in R (v3.4.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref079">79</xref>] to group the evolved Ylip-Hsp90-hosting clones according to their fitness similarity between different conditions.

The Pearson correlation distance (d = 1 − Pearson’s correlation coefficient) is used to represent the phenotypic distance between each pair of conditions.

<title>Whole genome sequencing analysis</title>
<p>Yeast genomic DNA was isolated using the previously described phenol/chloroform method with one more run of 200 μL of PCIA resuspension and 95% ethanol precipitation to remove the residual RNase A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref082">82</xref>]. Isolated genomic DNA was fragmented using a Covaris microTUBE M220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Worburn, MA) and DNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free HT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Ancestral and each evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clone was sequenced to an average depth of 100-fold coverage with a rapid-mode Illumina HiSeq 2500 system (250 bp paired-end reads) and the spore pools were sequenced to an average depth of 200-fold coverage with the NextSeq 500 system (150 bp paired-end reads).</p>
<p>For single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, raw reads were mapped, and SNPs with coverage greater than 20-fold and a frequency higher than 35 (for the segregant analysis, the allele frequency threshold was lowered to 10 to include more low-frequency evolved mutations) were called using CLC bio software (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Evolved mutations were manually identified by comparing the mutation lists between evolved and ancestral <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones, and poor-quality SNPs were excluded after manual checking using the Integrative Genome Viewer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref083">83</xref>]. Two kinds of mutations were further excluded from our evolved mutation list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s012">S4 Table</xref>): double-called SNPs due to overlap between two open reading frames, and SNPs (<italic>grx3-A196V</italic>, <italic>hop1-K510fs</italic>, <italic>isu1-I100V</italic>, and <italic>rsf2-C966G</italic>) shared by multiple evolved clones that were likely to be pre-existing SNPs in the ancestral population.</p>

<title>F1 segregant analysis</title>
<p>E4, E5, and E7 clones were backcrossed to the ancestral strain and the diploids were sporulated. Tetrads were dissected and only spores from four-viable spore tetrads were used. The fitness of F1 haploid progeny was examined under the following conditions: YPD at 28°C, YPD at 37°C, and YPD + GuHCl at 28°C. The latter two conditions were included because they had a better resolution to separate the ancestral and evolved phenotypes. F1 haploid progenies with fitness similar to the evolved or ancestral clones were assigned into good or bad spore pools, respectively. A maximum of one good and one bad spore was selected from a single tetrad. If all four progeny from a single tetrad had fitness that deviated from the evolved and ancestral strains, then none were selected. Individual E7 spores behaved similarly under the high temperature and GuHCl conditions (r = 0.851, Pearson correlation). When cells behaved differently under two conditions, we used the more prominent phenotype of the evolved clone to select the spores (i.e., fitness at 37°C for E4 and fitness in GuHCl-containing medium for E5). We picked 5–20 spores for each pool and employed Illumina sequencing to examine the mutant allele frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006450.s017">S9 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The two frequency thresholds used to select the mutations with strong effects were determined based on computational simulations following the previous method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006450.ref085">85</xref>].

<title>The phenotypic differences between Ylip-Hsp90– and Scer-Hsc82–carrying cells are not due to differences in the expression level or activity of these two orthologs.</title>
<p>(A) The protein levels of Scer-Hsc82 and Ylip-Hsp90 are not significantly different between the ancestral <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> and <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> strains (<italic>p</italic> = 0.071, <italic>z</italic> = −1.807, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Total cell protein was extracted and examined by western blot. The Hsp90 protein was N-terminally fused with a TAP tag and detected by the anti-TAP antibody. G6PDH was used as the internal control. The TAP-Hsp90/G6PDH ratios were normalized to that of the <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> strain, and the bottom panel shows quantitative data of the western blot. Error bar represents the standard error, <italic>N</italic> ≥ 3. (B) Scer-Hsc82 and Ylip-Hsp90 exhibit similar v-src folding activities (<italic>p</italic> = 0.827, <italic>z</italic> = −0.218, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Log-phase cells were grown in galactose-containing medium for 6 hours to induce the expression of v-src. The same amount of total cell protein was loaded for each sample and examined by western blot. The phospho-tyrosine and v-src were detected by anti-phospho-tyrosine and anti-v-src antibodies, respectively. The phospho-tyrosine/v-src ratios were normalized to that of the <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> strain, and the right panel shows quantitative data of the western blot. Error bar represents the standard error, <italic>N</italic> = 3.

<p>Two isogenic subpopulations labeled with red or green fluorescence protein were mixed in an approximately 1:1 ratio in the initial cultures and allowed to evolve in YPD at 28°C. The subpopulation that obtained a beneficial mutation would start expanding its frequency in the evolved culture. The proportions of subpopulations were monitored using flow cytometry. The y-axis shows the green subpopulation frequency and the x-axis shows the numbers of evolved generations.

<title>The evolved phenotypes of <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones are more divergent than those of <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones.</title>
<p>(A) PCA analysis of the fitness values shows that all <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones evolved diverged phenotypes, scattered across the four principal component dimensions. Explanatory power is shown in brackets next to each principal component. (B) Fitness improvements of the evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones under 11 different growth conditions. Cells were grown in liquid cultures and growth rates were measured by plate readers. Error bars are standard errors, <italic>N</italic> ≥ 2. Drug abbreviations are the same as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006450.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. Fitness improvement was calculated by comparing the fitness of the evolved clone to that of the ancestral <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> strain. (C) Evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones responded to various stress conditions more differently than evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones. The variance of fitness improvements of evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> or <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones in each condition is plotted. The evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones have significantly greater variances of fitness improvements compared with evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones (<italic>p</italic> = 0.039, one-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test). (D) Evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones have greater Pearson correlation distances between different conditions than evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones. The result suggests that evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> clones generally have different fitness distribution patterns under different conditions, whereas the fitness patterns of evolved <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones are similar to each other regardless of the stress types. Pearson correlation distances in all possible pairs of conditions were pooled and compared between evolved <italic>Ylip-HSP90</italic> and <italic>Scer-HSC82</italic> clones (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
