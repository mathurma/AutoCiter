				<article-title>A Smart Mutation Scheme Produces Hundreds of Functional Proteins</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Creating artificial protein families affords new opportunities to explore the determinants of structure and biological function free from many of the constraints of natural selection. We have created an artificial family comprising ̃3,000 P450 heme proteins that correctly fold and incorporate a heme cofactor by recombining three cytochromes P450 at seven crossover locations chosen to minimize structural disruption. Members of this protein family differ from any known sequence at an average of 72 and by as many as 109 amino acids. Most (&gt;73%) of the properly folded chimeric P450 heme proteins are catalytically active peroxygenases; some are more thermostable than the parent proteins. A multiple sequence alignment of 955 chimeras, including both folded and not, is a valuable resource for sequence-structure-function studies. Logistic regression analysis of the multiple sequence alignment identifies key structural contributions to cytochrome P450 heme incorporation and peroxygenase activity and suggests possible structural differences between parents CYP102A1 and CYP102A2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Our understanding of how protein sequence relates to structure and function is aided by comparisons of sequences related by evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b002">2</xref>]. With only limited numbers of highly divergent sequences, however, such analyses are often uninformative. Furthermore, because the sequences have been culled by natural selection, relationships between sequence and physical or chemical properties not under direct selection are difficult or impossible to discern. We would like to create artificial protein families in order to probe the range of sequence and functional diversity that is compatible with a given structure, free from the constraint of having to function in the narrow context of the host organism. These artificial sequences would help us to identify connections to functions that may not be important biologically (e.g., high thermostability, new substrate specificity, or ability to fold into a particular structure, but not catalyze a particular reaction), but are critical for understanding the proteins themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b003">3</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b004">4</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>The products of millions of years of divergence and natural selection, protein families contain members that differ at large numbers of amino acids residues. Creating numerous diverse and folded sequences in the laboratory is challenging, due in part to the sparsity of proteins in sequence space. Among random sequences, estimates of the frequency of functional proteins range from 1 in 10<sup>11</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b005">5</xref>] to as little as 1 in 10<sup>77</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b006">6</xref>]. Randomly mutating a functional parent sequence improves the odds, but highly mutated sequences are still exceedingly unlikely to fold into recognizable proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b007">7</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b008">8</xref>]. The methods by which novel proteins have been created, including selection from libraries of random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b005">5</xref>] or patterned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b009">9</xref>] sequences, evolution from existing sequences by iterative mutation or recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b010">10</xref>], and by structure-guided design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b011">11</xref>] as well as computation-intensive protein design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b012">12</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b013">13</xref>], either yield small numbers of characterized sequences or numerous sequences with low diversity (few sequence changes).
			</p>
      <p>We are developing site-directed, homologous recombination guided by structure-based computation (SCHEMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b016">16</xref>] to create libraries of protein sequences that are simultaneously highly mutated and have a high likelihood of folding into the parental structure. Mutations made by recombination of functional sequences are much more likely to be compatible with the particular protein fold than are random mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b017">17</xref>]. SCHEMA calculations allow us to minimize the number of structural contacts that are disrupted when portions of the sequence are inherited from different parents, further increasing the probability that the chimeric proteins will fold. The validity of the SCHEMA disruption metric has been demonstrated in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b016">16</xref>]. SCHEMA, however, has not yet been used to design a library to maximize the number of sequences with low disruption and high mutation.
			</p>
      <p>Here we report SCHEMA-guided recombination of three cytochromes P450 to create 6,561 chimeras, of which ̃3,000 are properly folded P450 proteins. Cytochromes P450 comprise a superfamily of heme enzymes with myriad biological functions, including key roles in drug metabolism, breakdown of xenobiotics, and steroid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b018">18</xref>]. More than 4,500 sequences of this ubiquitous enzyme are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b019">19</xref>]. Members of the artificial family of chimeric P450s reported here differ from any known protein by up to 109 amino acids, yet most retain significant catalytic activity. Unlike natural protein families, this artificial family also includes sequences that do not fold or function. Inclusion of nonfunctional sequences enables us to apply powerful logistic regression tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b020">20</xref>] to the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the laboratory-generated proteins and determine which elements contribute to correct heme incorporation and retention of catalytic activity in the cytochrome P450 heme domain.

        <title>SCHEMA Design and Construction of a Chimeric P450 Library</title>
        <p>We generated an artificial family of cytochromes P450 by recombining fragments of the genes encoding the heme-binding domains of three bacterial P450s, CYP102A1 (also known as P450<sub>BM3</sub>), CYP102A2, and CYP102A3 (abbreviated A1, A2, and A3), which share ̃65% amino acid identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b021">21</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The parent proteins are 463–466 amino acids long and contain the single substitution F87A (A1) or F88A (A2 and A3), which increases the peroxygenase activities of these heme domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b023">23</xref>]. Calculations of the SCHEMA disruption that results when residue–residue contacts present in the parent structure are broken by recombination (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) served to guide the placement of crossovers so as to maximize the number of highly mutated, folded proteins in the resulting library.

        </fig>
        <p>To accomplish this, we used the structure of the heme domain from CYP102A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b024">24</xref>] to computationally evaluate 5,000 libraries with seven crossovers, each of which contained 3<sup>8</sup> = 6,561 chimeric sequences (including the parents). Crossover sites were chosen randomly, with a minimum fragment size of 20 residues. To estimate the fraction of folded proteins in each library, we counted the number of structural contacts, E, disrupted in each chimeric sequence (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b014">14</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b016">16</xref>]. Based on data from 17 A1–A2 chimeras individually constructed and studied previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b025">25</xref>], we modeled the probability of folding as a step function which decreases from 1 to 0 at a threshold of E = 30. Fraction folded was thus calculated as the number of chimeras in each library with E ≤ 30 divided by the total number of chimeras (= 6,561). The average number of amino acid substitutions from the closest parent &lt;m&gt; for the folded proteins (those with E ≤ 30) was also calculated as a measure of the library sequence diversity.
				</p>
        <p>From the set of 5,000 randomly generated libraries, we selected only those with a fraction folded greater than 25% for further study. Within these, 14 crossover locations dominated, appearing in more than 40% of the libraries. Using these 14 crossover sites, we evaluated all 3,432 possible seven-crossover libraries and chose one with a high fraction folded (40%), high diversity (&lt;m&gt; = 68 for the chimeras with E ≤ 30, &lt;m&gt; = 76.4 for the library as a whole), and crossovers distributed over the primary sequence (average number of residues per block = 59 ± 10). The final design has crossovers located after residues Glu64, Ile122, Tyr166, Val216, Thr268, Ala328, and Gln404, based on the numbering of the A1 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).
				</p>
        <p>The individual structural elements identified by SCHEMA are not obvious based on secondary or domain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g002">Figures 2</xref> and 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g003">3</xref>A). For example, the crossovers between blocks 2–3, 4–5, 5–6, and 7–8 lie within the D, G, I and L helices, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b026">26</xref>]. Individual blocks, however, combine to form larger structural elements that coincide with protein domains determined from inspection of the A1 crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b026">26</xref>] and concerted motions evident in molecular dynamics simulations of the same protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Blocks 1 and 7 comprise the independent “β domain,” most of which is a five-stranded β-sheet. The two-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet comes from block 7, while the remaining three β-strands are contributed by block 1. The library design divided this domain into the fewest possible pieces. The remaining blocks comprise the “α domain” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b026">26</xref>], which on the basis of concerted protein motions has been divided further into α′ (corresponding to blocks 4 and 5) and α″ domains (blocks 6 and 8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b027">27</xref>]. These three domains reflect groups of residues that move together not only in molecular dynamic simulations but also between different conformations of A1, which undergoes a large conformational change upon substrate binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b028">28</xref>]. Considering the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the substrate-bound (closed) and substrate-free (open) forms of A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b029">29</xref>], five of seven crossovers are in regions which move 1.2 Å or less, significantly less than the average displacement of 2.2 Å, and capture the boundaries of the previously defined domains within six residues.

Crossover 3–4 is located next to a region of high identity and may be shifted towards the N-terminus by up to 14 residues and still produce the same chimeras. This shift allows it to occur at a position which moves &lt; 1.2 Å.

        <p>The three gene fragments encoding each of the eight blocks were combinatorially assembled using the sequence-independent site-directed chimeragenesis (SISDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b030">30</xref>] method developed specifically for this application to generate a gene library containing 6,561 different sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

        <title>Sequence Analysis</title>
        <p>Because the crossover locations are fixed, the complete sequence of a chimera (absent any point mutations, insertions, or deletions) can be obtained by determining which parent sequence is present at each block by DNA probe hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b031">31</xref>]. Out of 1,512 randomly selected colonies analyzed this way, 754 complete sequences were obtained. Of these, 628 were unique. The distribution of fragments in this sample revealed two main biases from the ideal incorporation of 33% of each parent at each block (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>): at block 1, parent A1 is present in 10% of the chimeras, while parent A2 is present at block 4 in only 0.5%.
				</p>
        <p>We completely sequenced 39 chimeras in order to assess the frequency of point mutations and of insertions, deletions, and remaining tag sequences (indels). Tag sequences were inserted at each crossover location for library construction by SISDC, and any remaining tag sequences result in a large insertion. In seven randomly chosen chimeras we found only one synonymous point mutation and no indels. We also sequenced 32 randomly chosen chimeras for which folding status had been determined. Twenty of these encoded folded P450s, while 12 encoded proteins that were not P450s. In the 20 folded P450 sequences, there were zero remaining tag indels and two point mutations. In the 12 not-folded sequences, one point mutation and one remaining tag sequence were found. From the overall point mutation frequency of 0.007% (in 51,568 nucleotides), we estimate that fewer than 10% of the chimeras in the library contain a point mutation. No indels or tag sequences were found in any of the folded P450 sequences, and fewer than 9% of the not folded chimeras contain indels or tags. Comparing the results from DNA sequencing and probe hybridization analysis, we found that probe hybridization identified the correct fragment at all eight blocks in 31 of 32 sequences. Thus the sequencing information from probe hybridization reflects the true sequences of the chimeras with errors in less than 10% of the chimeras, the majority of which are due to single point mutations.</p>

        <p>Using high-throughput CO difference spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b032">32</xref>], we assayed clones from the chimeric P450 library for the characteristic Soret peak at 450 nm. The presence of this peak indicates correct heme binding and thus a properly folded P450 heme protein. Of the 628 unique full-length sequences, 293 (47%) encoded folded P450s. Additional sequencing of folded P450s yielded an expanded dataset containing 955 unique sequences (including the three parents), of which 620 correctly incorporate heme and 335 do not (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Thirty-eight of these 335 not-folded sequences gave a peak at 420 nm, characteristic of improperly incorporated heme and a nonfunctional enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b033">33</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b034">34</xref>]. The remaining not-folded sequences lack a compatible heme-binding site and likely do not fold into a well-defined structure.

        <p>The folded sequences are highly mosaic and differ from their parents by 72.5 amino acids on average, with as many as 109 amino acid substitutions from the nearest parent sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and

The average number of mutations in the heme-binding chimeras is also lower, 72.9 versus 77.5. The compositions of chimeras can be easily visualized using ternary diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g004">Figure 4</xref>). For example, the sequence biases against single A1 and A2 fragments in the library construction generates fewer chimeras whose compositions are very close to A1 or A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

        <title>Catalytic Activities of Folded P450 Chimeras</title>
        <p>We estimated the fraction of chimeras that are functional by assaying 320 folded P450 chimeras for peroxygenase activity on 2-phenoxyethanol, a substrate accepted by all three parents. Reaction on this substrate yields phenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g005">Figure 5</xref>), which is detectable in high throughput [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b035">35</xref>].

These monooxygenases use NADPH and molecular oxygen to hydroxylate fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b022">22</xref>]. The parent heme domains, by virtue of the single amino acid substitutions F87A in A1 and F88A in A2 and A3, also function as peroxygenases, catalyzing oxygen insertion in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b023">23</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b025">25</xref>]. Chimeras that produced at least 25% of the total product formed in the assay by the most active parent (A1) were considered active. Of the 320 folded chimeras assayed, 72% were found to be active on 2-phenoxyethanol.

					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The parent A1 and A2 heme domains are active on 12-pNCA, while A3 is not. Chimeras with 25% of the total product formed by A1 during the assay were considered active. None of the chimeras that did not fold properly showed activity. We then determined activity status for folded P450s whose concentration was at least 500 nM, in order to remove false negatives based on low expression or other experimental errors. Of the folded chimeras, 441 met this constraint, of which 134 (30%) were active on 12-pNCA (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). The average number of disruptions is lower for chimeras active on 12-pNCA versus those that are not (&lt;E&gt; = 26.3 versus 31.4). Mutations are similarly lower in active chimeras (&lt;m&gt; = 70.9 versus 76.9).

Parent A3 is inactive on 12-pNCA, and there are only a few chimeras with a high fraction of sequence from A3 that exhibit this activity. Additionally, there is a lower density of active chimeras near the center, where the chimeric sequences have the greatest divergence from the parents.
				</p>
        <p>Fewer chimeras showed activity on 12-pNCA than on 2-phenoxyethanol, which we attribute to the fact that one parent, A3, is not active towards 12-pNCA, while all three parents are active on 2-phenoxyethanol. Overall, 73% of the folded chimeras assayed exhibited peroxygenase activity on at least one of these two substrates. Thus, at least 35% of the 6,561 sequences in the library are folded and functional, corresponding to 2,300 new P450 enzymes, not including any that are active on substrates not tested. This functional fraction is roughly three times higher than reported in a study in which more closely related cytochromes P450 (&gt;71% amino acid identity) were recombined using a DNA shuffling methodology that leads to crossovers at regions of high sequence identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b036">36</xref>].

        <p>To examine how recombination affects protein stability, we measured the melting temperatures of the parent P450s and 14 chimeras (all of which denature irreversibly at high temperature) by monitoring the disappearance of the P450 Soret peak with increasing temperature. A range of T<sub>m</sub>'s (42 °C–62 °C) was observed in this small sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040112-t001">Table 1</xref>). The most stable chimera differs from its closest parent by 84 amino acid substitutions, yet its melting temperature is 7 °C higher than the most stable parent. It is also higher than that of a variant of the A1 heme domain previously stabilized by sequential random mutagenesis and screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b037">37</xref>]. If a chimera is able to bind heme, then on average its stability appears not to be compromised relative to the parent proteins. The ability of the blocks to assemble into more thermostable proteins when removed from their natural context supports the modular nature of these elements and likely reflects some intrinsic stability of the individual blocks, due to the large number of structural contacts preserved by the library design.

        <title>Logistic Regression Analysis of the Multiple Sequence Alignments</title>
        <p>Small sets of chimeric P450s have been constructed previously for investigations of sequence-structure-function relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b038">38</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b039">39</xref>]. The MSA of natural protein families are also widely used for this purpose. Comprised of sequences largely uncoupled from natural selection, including sequences that encode nonnatural functions (such as not folding or not functioning), the artificial protein family described here offers a unique opportunity to elucidate key sequence and structural contributions to P450 folding and function. By analyzing the MSAs of the chimeric P450s we can identify how different blocks and their parental identities influence folding and heme binding or catalytic activity. Because this dataset also includes sequences that encode not-folded and not-functional proteins, we can use logistic regression analysis (LRA), an analog of linear regression suitable for the type of binary data presented here, to analyze the MSAs. Other, more commonly used methods such as contingency table [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b040">40</xref>,

				</p>
        <p>Underlying our LRA of the folded/not-folded dataset is the idea that individual fragments and interactions between fragment pairs contribute to whether a chimera will fold and bind heme. LRA fits an energy model containing intra- and inter-fragment terms; the magnitude of each term reflects how strongly that variable affects the likelihood of folding, with negative values increasing the likelihood and positive values decreasing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b020">20</xref>]. If energy is below a threshold, a chimera is assumed to be folded; otherwise it is not. In order to avoid overfitting the data, 
					<italic>p</italic>-value testing is used to determine which fragments make a significant contribution to predicting chimera folding status.

        <p>We applied LRA to the MSA of the entire set of 955 chimeric P450s in

This analysis revealed that blocks 1, 5, and 7 by themselves and the interaction between blocks 1 and 7 (abbreviated 1–7) contribute significantly to whether a chimeric P450 folds and binds heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

        <p>As shown in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, the intra-fragment terms for fragments 1.2 and 7.3 have lower energy relative to the other parents, which means the sequence changes in these fragments are more favorable for heme binding. Blocks 1 and 7 are in fact expected to be important, because they contain the most residues, the greatest number of intra-fragment contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>E), and block 1 has the highest average number of sequence changes, whereas block 7 has the third most (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). In contrast, block 5 has the third fewest intra-fragment contacts and the second fewest average number of sequence changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). At this block, fragment 5.1 is the least favored of all the fragments for folding and heme binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Parent A1 contains a deletion relative to A2 and A3 in block 5, which may contribute to this behavior. We suspect that some of the importance of block 5 is due to the dynamic nature of cytochromes P450, similar to what has been observed in multiple sequence analyses of other protein families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b002">2</xref>]. The F, G, and H helices (in blocks 4 and 5) undergo displacements of more than 5 Å between the substrate-bound and substrate-free forms of A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b029">29</xref>], and block 5 moves an average of 3.6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). This portion of the enzyme acts as a “hinge” by which the F and G helices close down upon the substrate. Because none of the residues in block 5 that contact the heme differ among the three parents, the importance must stem from how variable amino acids in block 5 affect dynamics or interact with conserved residues.

        <p>Block pair 1–7 was the only pair revealed by LRA as significant for folding and incorporation of heme. Blocks 1 and 7 interact extensively to form the β-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) and experience the largest average number of broken contacts when the blocks are inherited from different parents.

This result supports the core hypothesis of SCHEMA and other penalizing energy functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b043">43</xref>] which assign the best possible score to these wild-type interactions.

        <p>We repeated the logistic regression analysis to determine which blocks affect activity on 12-pNCA, independent of heme binding, by applying LRA to the subset of 441 folded chimeras for which presence or absence of activity on 12-pNCA had been determined (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). This analysis revealed that blocks 2 and 4 by themselves and block pair 1–8 contribute to whether a folded chimera is catalytically active on this substrate. At blocks 2 and 4, the fragments derived from parent A3 are detrimental to activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). These sequence elements likely account for A3′s lack of activity on this substrate, since sequence from this parent at other blocks has little affect on 12-pNCA activity in the chimeras. The importance of block pair 1–8 may reflect a difference between A1 and A2 with respect to substrate binding: when A1 or A2 is present at either block 1 or 8, activity is strongly dependent on whether the other block comes from the same parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). This indicates that there are one or more interactions between blocks 1 and 8 that must be preserved in order for the enzyme to be active on 12-pNCA.

        <title>Residues Contributing to Peroxygenase Activity on 12-pNCA</title>
        <p>We sought to determine what interactions(s) might be responsible for the importance of the 1–8 pair, using the sequence differences in parents A1 and A2 for guidance. One obvious difference occurs at the position corresponding to Arg47 in fragment 1.1, which is located at the opening of the active site and is thought to interact with the carboxylate group of fatty acid substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b029">29</xref>]. Substitutions of this residue in the A1 holoenzyme significantly reduce catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b044">44</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b045">45</xref>]. In A2, the equivalent residue is Gly48, a residue that favors the binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons when present in the A1 holoenzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b046">46</xref>]. We tested the importance of R47 to peroxygenase activity by swapping the residues at position 47/48 in A1 and A2, i.e., making the single mutation R47G in A1 and G48R in A2. The R47G mutation in A1 reduced the initial rate nearly 25 fold (from 65.9 ± 8.5 to 2.7 ± 0.5 nmol product/nmol P450/min), making it comparable to the activity of A2. On the other hand, the G48R mutation in A2 had no effect on rate. This suggested to us that G48 in A2 does not interact with the substrate carboxylate group, as the equivalent residue appears to do in A1.
				</p>
        <p>We postulated that the different mode of substrate binding could be facilitated by a positively charged residue elsewhere in the A2 sequence. Only a small portion of block 8, consisting of halves of two β-strands (residues 434 to 439), is located near the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Examination of the parental sequence alignment in this region (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>), however, revealed no lysines or arginines unique to fragment 8.2. Because fragments 8.1 and 8.3 are equally incompatible with 1.2 according to the LRA, we looked for a residue between 434 and 439 that was shared by A1 and A3 but not A2. Residue 435 in A1 (437 in A2 and A3), which is a glutamate in A1 and A3 and a glutamine in A2, met these criteria.
				</p>
        <p>We then swapped these residues by making the E435Q mutation in A1 and the Q437E mutation in A2. The E435Q mutation in A1 reduced catalytic rate by 8 fold, whereas the Q437E mutation completely abolished the activity of A2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040112-t002">Table 2</xref>). Having shown this residue to be important to activity in both parents, we next chose eight inactive chimeras containing unfavorable 1–8 block combinations to determine whether swapping these positions could “rescue” the activity. We introduced the Q437E mutation into four chimeras with fragments 1.1 and 8.2 and the E435Q mutation into four with fragments 1.2 and 8.1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040112-t002">Table 2</xref>). This single substitution was able to confer activity in two of the eight chimeras.

        <p>Thus the LRA analysis in combination with mutation studies uncovered a residue (Glu435/Gln437) previously unknown to be important for catalytic activity and suggests a different substrate binding mode in CYP102A2. One structural explanation for these results is illustrated in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g007">7</xref>D. Since A2 lacks a positive charge at position 48 and has no unique positively charged residues in the small portion of block 8 near the active site (or block 8 altogether), we hypothesized that another sequence change may have caused a positively charged residue to be made available elsewhere. Glu435 in A1 appears to participate in a salt bridge with Lys24, which is roughly 4 Å away in the crystal structure. The equivalent residue 25 is a lysine in A2 and a glutamine in A3. The lack of a salt bridge partner near Lys25 in A2 could free Lys25 to interact with the carboxylate tail of the fatty acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040112-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). In support of this, a single substitution of Gln437 to Glu rescued the activity of a chimera containing A2 sequence at block 8, but A1 sequence at block 1. Conversely, switching Glu435 to Gln in a chimera containing A1 sequence at block 8 but A2 sequence at block 1 was also able to rescue the activity. Of course, this single switch was unable to rescue activity in six more folded, but inactive chimeras, which indicates that additional interactions are also important (such as the contributions from residues in blocks 2 and 4).

        <title>SCHEMA-Guided Recombination Creates a Library Rich in Properly Folded, Highly Mutated Sequences</title>
        <p>The approach used here to identify optimal recombination sites differs from the SCHEMA profile described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b014">14</xref>]. Evaluating libraries with randomly sampled crossovers, as was done here, and a recently developed global optimization of recombination sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b047">47</xref>] are both preferred over the SCHEMA profile, which neglects important structural interactions between amino acids distant in the primary sequence. Based on this design, three cytochromes P450 were divided into “building blocks” and combinatorially reassembled to yield a library in which 47% of the members fold and correctly bind heme. This folded fraction is slightly larger than the prediction of 40% from the design. The full library therefore contains an estimated 3,000 unique chimeric P450s, many of which are highly mutated compared to the parent P450s.
				</p>
        <p>It is interesting to estimate the extent to which SCHEMA recombination has enriched the library relative to a library having the same distribution of mutation levels, but made using random mutagenesis. The fraction of folded proteins in a random library can be estimated using the protein's “neutrality,” or probability that a random amino acid substitution will not disrupt folding. Neutrality 
					<italic>ν</italic> has been calculated for other proteins and ranges from 0.38 to 0.56 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040112-b007">7</xref>]. Using 0.6 as a conservative estimate for P450 neutrality, the fraction of folded P450s having a mutation distribution equaling that of the chimeras

        <p>where

					</italic> = 6.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. The fraction of folded chimeras in the library is 0.47, giving an enrichment of 0.47/ff<sub>r</sub> = 7.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>. Thus, by this conservative estimate, SCHEMA-guided recombination has increased the frequency of folded chimeras by nearly four orders of magnitude.

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Protein families generated in the laboratory can be used to identify regions of the sequence and structure that are important for folding and function. This approach may be especially valuable for proteins with few naturally occurring family members. Datasets such as this one, containing hundreds of proteins for which functional information can be determined in high-throughput assays, will be invaluable for developing and validating structure prediction tools and for protein sequence-structure-function analysis. Finally, rich in sequence diversity as well as the ability to fold properly, these proteins may be sources of novel functions for laboratory protein evolution.</p>
