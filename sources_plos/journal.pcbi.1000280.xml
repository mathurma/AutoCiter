<p>Certain theories suggest that it should be difficult or impossible to eradicate a vaccine-preventable disease under voluntary vaccination: Herd immunity implies that the individual incentive to vaccinate disappears at high coverage levels. Historically, there have been examples of declining coverage for vaccines, such as MMR vaccine and whole-cell pertussis vaccine, that are consistent with this theory. On the other hand, smallpox was globally eradicated by 1980 despite voluntary vaccination policies in many jurisdictions. Previous modeling studies of the interplay between disease dynamics and individual vaccinating behavior have assumed that infection is transmitted in a homogeneously mixing population. By comparison, here we simulate transmission of a vaccine-preventable SEIR infection through a random, static contact network. Individuals choose whether to vaccinate based on infection risks from neighbors, and based on vaccine risks. When neighborhood size is small, rational vaccinating behavior results in rapid containment of the infection through voluntary ring vaccination. As neighborhood size increases (while the average force of infection is held constant), a threshold is reached beyond which the infection can break through partially vaccinated rings, percolating through the whole population and resulting in considerable epidemic final sizes and a large number vaccinated. The former outcome represents convergence between individually and socially optimal outcomes, whereas the latter represents their divergence, as observed in most models of individual vaccinating behavior that assume homogeneous mixing. Similar effects are observed in an extended model using smallpox-specific natural history and transmissibility assumptions. This work illustrates the significant qualitative differences between behavior–infection dynamics in discrete contact-structured populations versus continuous unstructured populations. This work also shows how disease eradicability in populations where voluntary vaccination is the primary control mechanism may depend partly on whether the disease is transmissible only to a few close social contacts or to a larger subset of the population.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Interest in infectious disease models that incorporate the effects of human behavior has been growing in recent years. However, most of these models predict that it should never be possible to eradicate a disease under voluntary vaccination, due to nonvaccinating “free riders” that emerge when vaccine coverage is high. This prediction contradicts the fact that smallpox was eradicated under a voluntary vaccination policy in many jurisdictions, and that other diseases such as polio are likewise near eradication. These previous models assumed that populations mix homogeneously. However, for some diseases, such as HIV and smallpox, individuals are more likely to get the disease from certain social contacts. Here we show that using a network model that captures this social structure can reconcile the previous theories to the empirical fact that diseases can be eradicated under voluntary vaccination. When infection is transmitted only through close contacts in the network, then an outbreak can be quickly contained using only voluntary vaccination. However, when infection can potentially be transmitted to almost everyone in the network (such as for measles), a disease outbreak can never be contained using voluntary vaccination. This latter observation may have some relevance to the Measles–Mumps–Rubella autism “vaccine scare.”</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Model-based analyses of vaccination programmes have often concluded that it should be difficult or impossible to eradicate a vaccine-preventable disease under a voluntary vaccination policy without other incentives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Fine1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Barrett1">[10]</xref>. As vaccination coverage increases, the disease becomes increasingly rare due to herd immunity. Eventually, the infection risk to susceptible individuals decreases to zero, while the individual risk due to the vaccine remains constant. Hence, the individual motive to vaccinate is also reduced to zero as vaccine coverage increases. This should be true, in principle, even for a disease such as smallpox with very high case fatality rates, as long as the infection risk is deemed sufficiently small. This effect, similar to the “Prisoner's Dilemma” has also been explored in game theoretical analyses of infectious disease dynamics and vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Galvani1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Vardavas1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Breban1">[9]</xref>. In game theoretical treatments, it has been shown that vaccine coverage beyond the eradication threshold is not a Nash equilibrium if vaccine risk is nonzero, because a small group of individuals can achieve a higher payoff by switching to a nonvaccinator strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch2">[4]</xref>. Such strategic, self-interested behavior has been suggested as a possible contributor to vaccine scares in countries with a voluntary vaccination policy, such as England &amp; Wales, which experienced declines in vaccine uptake for pertussis in the 1970s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch3">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Gangarosa1">[11]</xref>, and in measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Roberts1">[12]</xref>. Recent work has explored exceptions to this rule, for instance finding cases of multiple equilibria when virulence varies with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Reluga1">[13]</xref> and when vaccines are sufficiently imperfect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Chen1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>To date, smallpox is the only vaccine-preventable disease ever to have been globally eradicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Fenner1">[15]</xref>, although polio is closer to eradication than ever before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Global1">[16]</xref>. The last foothold of smallpox was in low-income countries, particularly in Africa and South Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Brilliant1">[17]</xref>. Jurisdictions in these countries often had widely varying vaccination policies. For instance, vaccination was compulsory in some Indian states, but voluntary in others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Barrett1">[10]</xref>. Even in the final stages of eradication, when outbreaks were becoming less frequent, individuals often continued to voluntarily opt for vaccination, without the benefit of individual financial incentives to vaccinate. If the foregoing theories are correct that diseases cannot generally be eradicated under voluntary vaccination, how was smallpox globally eradicated despite voluntary vaccination in some jurisdictions?</p>
<p>Most, if not all, previous mathematical models that analyze discrepancies between individually and socially optimal vaccination strategies under voluntary vaccination have considered populations without spatial or social contact structure (e.g. social networks), and where populations are large enough for the continuum approximation to apply. This also appears to be true of behavior-infection models more generally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Klein1">[18]</xref>, including those that study vaccine supply-demand dynamics at the international level, and non game-theoretical treatments of the problem. In these previous analyses, populations are generally considered to be homogeneously mixing, meaning that individuals are as likely to be infected by a member of their own household as they are by someone from the general public. However, the inadequacy of homogenous mixing models for certain situations has been widely documented, as have the differences between the predictions of homogeneous-mixing models and models where transmission is constrained to take place on a contact network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Keeling1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Aparicio1">[23]</xref>. In the present context, the homogeneous mixing assumption is arguably a good approximation for highly transmissible diseases spread primarily through aerosol droplets, such as measles. However, the assumption seems less valid for diseases that are transmitted through close contact, such as sexually-transmitted infections. Despite a few spectacular and widely reported cases of aerosol transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Gelfand1">[24]</xref>, smallpox is also spread primarily through close contact, and typically requires prolonged face-to-face contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Centers1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we show that disease dynamics under a voluntary vaccination policy are substantially and qualitatively altered by the introduction of individual-level social contact structure. We analyze a social contact network model, where each node represents an individual, and each link represents a close contact through which infection may spread. Individuals decide whether or not to vaccinate based upon their expected payoffs for vaccinating versus not vaccinating. We assume the vaccine is free to individuals, which describes the situation for many major pediatric vaccines in advanced countries, as well as the situation under the WHO smallpox eradication program in the 1970s. We first study epidemics on this contact network for a general vaccine-preventable infection with simplified SEIR-type (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) disease history. At baseline parameter values, for small neighborhood sizes, outbreaks are quickly contained using only voluntary ring vaccination. As the neighborhood size increases while infection risk (force of infection) is held constant, a threshold neighborhood size is reached. Above this threshold, voluntary vaccination fails and the population experiences both a considerable final epidemic size and a large number vaccinated. Hence, the limit of large neighborhood size in this model recovers dynamics similar to those of homogeneous mixing models. Because the force of infection is held constant as neighborhood size increases, the failure of voluntary vaccination is attributable solely to a decrease in how localized disease transmission is on the network. We associate smaller neighborhood sizes with close contact infections such as smallpox, and larger neighborhood sizes with diseases that do not require close contact for transmission, such as measles. We carry out a similar investigation for smallpox-specific disease history and vaccine properties, with similar results. This analysis illustrates the importance of considering discrete, contact-structured populations for modeling vaccinating behavior for close contact infections, and provides a framework for reconciling previous theoretical predictions concerning the ineradicability of infectious diseases under voluntary vaccination to the empirical fact of the global eradication of smallpox and local elimination of many other infectious diseases through voluntary vaccination.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Here we describe the social contact network, infection transmission, and assumptions regarding individual vaccinating behavior. Definitions of parameters and corresponding parameter values appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000280-t001">Table 1</xref>. We consider the case of a single epidemic outbreak. Because demographic processes are relatively slow on this timescale, we use a static network that does not include birth or death (other than due to the disease). An outbreak scenario was chosen, rather than an endemic situation, because the epidemiology of an infectious disease close to being eradicated is more aptly described in terms of stochastic outbreaks rather than sustained endemic transmission. The neighborhood size (node degree) of the network is Poisson-distributed with mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The network is formed by adding links to randomly selected nodes until the desired value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has been reached. After this, no further links are added, and the infection is introduced by inoculating <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> randomly chosen nodes out of a population of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> composed of susceptible individuals. We chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to ensure that outbreaks did not fail simply due to stochastic effects. Additionally, we ensured <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> so that successful outbreaks could go through at least two generations before depleting the pool of susceptible individuals. Hence, we expect results to be similar on larger networks.

After this time, the individual becomes infectious and remains so for a duration of time drawn from a gamma PDF with a mean of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a variance of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> days<sup>2</sup>. Subsequently, the individual either dies with perceived probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> due to fatal disease complications, or recovers to lifelong immunity with perceived probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A gamma PDF was used for its convenience and realism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Wearing1">[26]</xref>. The vaccine has efficacy <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and is assumed to confer lifelong immunity. The currency of the payoff functions is the number of life-years that the individual can expect to accrue as a result of their strategy choice. We do not consider non-fatal outcomes such as long-term health conditions and we assume that the start of infectiousness coincides with the appearance of symptoms. We also assume a relatively high baseline perceived probability of death due to vaccine, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to reflect the fact that individuals often have inflated perceptions of vaccine risks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Asch1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Smailbegovic1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>We first consider the payoff <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for not vaccinating today. If the individual does not vaccinate, s/he is either infected today (with perceived probability of infection <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or not (with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). If the individual is infected today, then s/he experiences fatal disease complications with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, accruing no additional life years. If the individual survives (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), s/he can expect to accrue <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> additional life years, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average remaining life expectancy for an individual who has lifelong immunity to the disease. Hence, the payoff if the nonvaccinating individual is infected is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. On the other hand, if the nonvaccinating individual escapes infection today, then s/he receives a payoff of <italic>α</italic>. This payoff represents the individual's expected remaining life years, given that they remain susceptible today because they were neither vaccinated nor infected. The total payoff <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to an individual who does not vaccinate today is therefore<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e048" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is influenced by the likelihood of being infected or of being compelled to vaccinate later on during the current epidemic oubreak in the population, and the likelihood that these result in death. It is impractical to derive a closed form expression for the probabilities of all these events in order to generate an expression for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Also, in reality, individuals may resort to “rules of thumb” when weighing future outcomes. However, it is reasonable in any case to expect <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, since a person with immunity can expect to outlive a person without immunity, on average.</p>
<p>Over time horizons longer than the current epidemic, other factors may contribute to what assumptions must be made about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For instance, if vaccine-derived immunity wanes and the population is subject to another outbreak 20 years hence, then vaccination today may appear less favourable, even if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is still valid. However, these distant future events would be heavily discounted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Meltzer1">[29]</xref> and so we will restrict our time horizon to the current outbreak only.</p>
<p>Due to uncertainties in exactly how much <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for our baseline analysis we assume <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (though we explore <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in sensitivity analysis). This makes nonvaccinating behavior more attractive and hence is a conservative assumption with respect to demonstrating the success of voluntary vaccination in containing outbreaks in a contact-structured population: if voluntary vaccination can control an oubreak for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, it should also be absent when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the baseline scenario, we assume <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> years, representing the average remaining life expectancy in good health in a typical developed country <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-StArnaud1">[30]</xref>. We note that the baseline value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not change the model dynamics qualitatively or quantitatively, since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scales with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (subject to above assumptions about future outbreaks).</p>
<p>We next compute the payoff <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to vaccinate today. If a person chooses to vaccinate, then either the vaccine is efficacious (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), or not (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). We suppose that the vaccine carries a perceived probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of death due to complications from the vaccine, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is generally small. (Under the assumption of perfect information, we note that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> could also be interpreted as the empirical probability of death.) If the vaccine is efficacious but results in fatal complications, then no additional life years are accrued. However, if the vaccine is efficacious and no complications ensue, then the individual receives a payoff<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e070" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>By comparison, if the vaccine is not efficacious, then either the individual dies from vaccine complications, accruing zero additional life years (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), or the individual does not die (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). If the individual does not die from the vaccine, then either the individual is infected today, or the individual is not infected today. If the individual is not infected today (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), then the individual has escaped both death due to the vaccine and infection and remain susceptible, so their payoff will be <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, if the person is infected (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), then they suffer a perceived probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of dying due to the disease, but if they survive (probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), their payoff is lifelong immunity, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> accrued life-years. Hence, in the case that the vaccine is not efficacious, the total payoff is<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e079" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>and from Equations 4 and 5, we have<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e080" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>On any given day, if<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e081" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>then the individual decides to vaccinate. Otherwise they may still vaccinate in future according to the same decision rules, and with no influence from their previous decision history.</p>

<title>Smallpox Infection</title>
<p>To tailor the model to the case of smallpox, we incorporate a more realistic description of the natural history of smallpox and the effects of vaccination. We incorporate the fact that conventional smallpox vaccine can work in individuals who are already infected: those who receive the vaccine within 3 days of infection usually do not become infectious and subsequently recover with long-term immunity, those who receive the vaccine 4–7 days post-exposure experience less severe symptoms but will be as infectious as an unvaccinated person, and those who receive the vaccine more than 7 days post-exposure gain no benefit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-1">[31]</xref>. Assumptions about network structure were the same as for the SEIR-type infection. For the case of smallpox, we used an empirical value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Edmundson1">[32]</xref>, though we discuss the effect of using larger values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To compute payoffs for the case of smallpox, we accounted for both fatal and non-fatal outcomes, such as pockmarks or blindness due to vaccine or disease. In order to compare fatal and non-fatal health outcomes in the same payoff function, the payoffs were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), i.e., the number of life years accrued, multiplied by a utility score between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health) to reflect quality of life during those years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Gold1">[33]</xref>. Utilities for each possible health state after vaccination or smallpox infection were obtained from the literature. The payoff functions for the generic vaccine-preventable infection (Equations 3 and 6) were thus adjusted to obtain the payoff functions for the case of smallpox:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e084" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e085" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the payoff to a person who becomes infected today by smallpox, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the payoff to a person who vaccinates today and in whom the vaccine has been efficacious (but who may experience complications or death due to vaccine), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the payoff to a person who vaccinates today and in whom the vaccine is not efficacious, but who avoids becoming infected today (and who may experience complications or death due to vaccine).

<title>Results</title>
<p>It is possible to show from Equations 3 and 6 that an individual with at least one infectious neighbor will vaccinate (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the individual) if and only if<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e097" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>The derivation of this expression appears in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000280.s001">Text S1</xref>. We note that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for many common vaccines. Also, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in most cases except when individuals have unrealistically inflated assessment of vaccine risks, such as during a “vaccine scare.” Therefore, whether or not an individual with at least one infectious neighbor vaccinates hinges largely upon the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is sufficiently high then self-interested (rational) vaccinating behavior will result in eradication in a contact-structured population. (We note that rational behavior is precisely what causes failure to eradicate in a homogeneously-mixing population under a voluntary vaccination policy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch2">[4]</xref>.) On the other hand, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is sufficiently small, then an individual with at least one infectious neighbor may not judge the risk of infection great enough to vaccinate, and the infection may thereby spread through the entire population. We note that Equation 10 holds regardless of the assumed network structure.</p>
<p>Low values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may occur for an infectious diseases where the number of social contacts through which infection can potentially be transmitted is large, but the probability of becoming infected from any single given contact is small. For instance, the number of potential effective contacts for measles transmission is large: the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized droplets that remain airborne for long periods, therefore the list of individuals to whom measles infection can potentially be passed is very large. However, even in a fully susceptible population, only 10–20 of these individuals are actually infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Anderson1">[34]</xref>. By comparison, we note that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may be high for a sexually transmitted or close contact infection, where the list of contacts to which infection can be transmitted may be small, but the probability of transmission to each contact is high.</p>
<p>In the present model, as the average neighborhood size increases and the node-to-node transmission rate declines correspondingly, we should therefore expect to find conditions where Equation 10 is violated and voluntary vaccination fails to contain the outbreak, as predicted by models that assume homogeneous mixing. To test for this, we simulated the spread of the SEIR-type and smallpox infections on the network under a wide range of possible values for the average neighborhood size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For each value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> tested, the value of the node-to-node transmission rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was adjusted so that the average force of infection per susceptible node remained the same as for the baseline parameter values. Holding the average force of infection constant as neighborhood size increases is crucial, since any change in model dynamics is thereby attributable to a decline in how localized the contact network is, rather than an increase in the overall force of infection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Morris1">[35]</xref> for an analogous approach for the effects of concurrency). Method I for maintaining constant infection risk assigned <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> day<sup>−1</sup> for each value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> tested (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> day<sup>−1</sup> = 0.2 day<sup>−1</sup> for the baseline parameters). Hence, a doubling of the number of social contacts would reduce the node-to-node transmission rate by half, which should maintain approximately the same infection risk per susceptible node as in the baseline scenario. However, higher-order effects relating to network structure are not accounted for in this approach and could change the infection risk in subtle ways. Therefore, we also controlled for infection risk using Method II, which involved calibrating the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to ensure the measured infection risk was the same across all neighborhood sizes. For each value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, simulations were run for a range of finely stratified <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which yielded a final epidemic size within 0.2% of the average baseline final size of 10 realizations was selected. Hence, for each value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we know a corresponding value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for which a given susceptible person has the same chance of becoming infected as for the baseline scenario. The simulations were run in a population without vaccination, since the goal was to obtain a range of infections with the same average risk to individuals but varying neighbourhood sizes, and including vaccination would thus bias this calibration. All other parameters were as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000280-t001">Table 1</xref>, except we maintained <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> throughout.</p>
<p>For the SEIR-type infection, the simulation results under Method I indicate that voluntary vaccination contains the outbreak until the average neighborhood size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000280-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Below this threshold, both the final size and total number vaccinated remain small, since the outbreak is easily controlled through voluntary ring vaccination. Above this threshold, each infected node infects more than one neighboring node on average (usually a nonvaccinator with insufficient infectious neighbors to compel him/her to vaccinate). As a result, the infection breaks through imperfect rings of vaccinated individuals, and percolates through the entire network until almost all individuals have been either vaccinated or infected. This outcome is qualitatively similar to the divergence between individually and socially optimal strategies observed in homogeneous mixing models–these exhibit regimes where a large number of individuals can choose to vaccinate, but never enough to eradicate the disease completely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch2">[4]</xref>. The simulation results under Method II are very similar, with failure of voluntary vaccination materializing once <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000280-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Hence, social contact structure can enable outbreak containment even when the neighborhood size is relatively large. We note that for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the threshold values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would be higher.</p>

<p>For smallpox infection, voluntary vaccination contains the outbreak for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000280-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). This difference compared to the SEIR-type infection is attributable mainly to the difference in the perceived probability of death due to the vaccine, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the case of the SEIR-type infection, the perceived probability was taken to be a relatively high <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, since individuals tend to inflate vaccine risks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bellaby1">[36]</xref>. However, for smallpox, we used the empirical value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore from Equation 10 we observe that value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be very low (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be very large) before voluntary vaccination fails to contain the outbreak. This would require a simulated population size on the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> million, but our simulation became prohibitively slow beyond <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We note that homogeneous mixing models assume the continuum approximation holds, such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a real number, and therefore voluntary vaccination should fail to contain an outbreak even for arbitrarily small vaccine risks and arbitrarily high case fatality rates. Simulations for smallpox with an inflated <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are similar to those for the SEIR-type infection, with voluntary vaccination not failing until the neighborhood size is significant.</p>
<p>We also carried out a univariate sensitivity analysis with respect to the payoff <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to individuals who remain susceptible, the node-to-node transmission rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the vaccine efficacy <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As each of these parameters was separately varied, the other parameters were kept at the baseline values. For the SEIR-type infection, in the case of varying <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we observe that voluntary vaccination contains the outbreak for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000280-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, vaccination appears attractive even in the absence of an infected neighbor, and all individuals vaccinate. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, vaccination is attractive when there is one or more infectious neighbors, and the outbreak is controlled through voluntary ring vaccination. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, vaccination only becomes attractive once the number of infectious neighbors is already quite large (i.e., too large to prevent further transmission), and hence the final size is very large. As <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> grows, the final size continues to grow and the number who seek vaccination continuously decline, since vaccination becomes progressively less attractive for larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, as discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> section, biologically realistic solutions are restricted to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The final size and number vaccinated is not strongly dependent on the transmission rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000280-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This is not surprising, since for small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> individuals rapidly vaccinate once it becomes known they have an infectious social contact, preventing further transmission. In the case of varying vaccine efficacy <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we observe that the final size increases monotonically as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> drop below 0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000280-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The number vaccinated is highest for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Below <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the number vaccinated is small because the vaccine is not efficacious enough to justify the individual decision to vaccinate. Above <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the number vaccinated is small because voluntary ring vaccination contains the outbreak relatively quickly. Results are similar for smallpox (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000280.s002">Figure S1</xref>). We also tested the robustness of model predictions to several extensions, such as including delays in time required for the vaccine to confer immunity, probabilistic descriptions of the individual decision-making process, and the possibility that individuals may choose to vaccinate once their neighbor's neighbors become infected, but found no major qualitative differences in model dynamics at biologically realistic parameter values (results not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is now a well-established principle in theoretical population biology that the dynamics of spatially structured populations can differ significantly from the dynamics of unstructured populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Durrett1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Rand1">[39]</xref>. In spatially structured populations, coexistence, diversity and altruism develop more easily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Matsuda1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-vanBaalen1">[41]</xref>, evolutionary velocities are slower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Rand2">[42]</xref>, and epidemics have more realistic time series and critical community sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Keeling3">[43]</xref>. Similar differences have been observed in the case of network models versus homogeneous mixing models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Keeling1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Aparicio1">[23]</xref>. The present model likewise illustrates dramatic changes in behavior-infection dynamics once social contact structure is introduced. When populations mix homogeneously, “rational” self-interested behavior leads to a divergence between individually and socially optimal strategies: vaccination coverage can be high, but never high enough to eradicate a vaccine-preventable infection. By comparison, the same kind of self-interested behavior in networks where contact structure is sufficiently local can rapidly and efficiently curtail outbreaks in discrete, contact-structured populations, through voluntary ring vaccination. This work also illustrates the importance of discrete effects in structured populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Durrett1">[37]</xref>. Events at the local, individual level (as played out in local neighborhoods on the network) can have significant implications for population-level outcomes such as final size and total number vaccinated. Finally, the present analysis recovers the homogeneous mixing case in the limit of large neighborhood size, thus capturing two qualitatively distinct regimes of behavior-infection dynamics. It thereby provides a framework for reconciling the predictions of behavior-infection models that assume homogeneously mixing populations to the empirical fact that many infectious diseases have been either globally eradicated or locally eliminated despite voluntary vaccination policies.</p>
<p>We expect that our results for SEIR infections should generally apply to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases where the SEIR disease history is a good approximation to the actual disease history, and where appearance of symptoms approximately coincides with the start of infectiousness. Examples of such diseases include smallpox (for the small neighbourhood limit), and measles, rubella, chickenpox, perhaps pertussis (for the large neighbourhood limit).</p>
<p>The basic reproductive number, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious person in an otherwise susceptible population), is a fundamental measure that indicates how easily an infectious disease outbreak can be controlled. However, recent theory points to other aspects of infectious diseases that may be equally important. For instance, one such aspect is the proportion of transmission occurring before the onset of clinical symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Fraser1">[44]</xref>. Likewise, the current analysis suggests that whether a disease requires close contact for transmission may be an important factor determining the feasibility of outbreak control under voluntary vaccination policies.</p>
<p>Some previous game theoretical models have suggested that eradication is less likely to occur under voluntary vaccination when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is higher, such as for measles and pertussis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Bauch3">[5]</xref>. The results from the present analysis dovetail with these earlier predictions, since diseases with higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are also more likely to be spread through means other than close personal contact. For these more transmissible infections, the average neighborhood size is higher since the number of social contacts that could potentially result in transmission events is greater. Hence, the results of the present study also suggest that diseases with higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are more likely to be associated with failure to eradicate under voluntary vaccination. The present results also extend previous predictions by showing how the severity of the disease, as expressed through <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, can influence whether voluntary vaccination will work.</p>
<p>It has previously been observed that spatial structure can also encourage the persistence of cooperative behavior in classical games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Nowak1">[45]</xref>. This is phenomenologically similar to what occurs in the present study: in a contact-structured population, what is optimal for the group becomes coincident with what is optimal for the individual, when neighborhood size is small enough. In the case of the Prisoner's Dilemma, small clusters of cooperating individuals can maintain “equal footing” with clusters of defectors, because of the high cooperate-cooperate payoffs that occur within cooperator clusters. In the present analysis the mechanism is quite different, having to do with the large difference in infection risk between those who neighbor infectious individuals and those who do not. This individual-level structure cannot be described in a homogeneously mixing population subject to the continuum approximation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Durrett1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>There were several limitations to the present analysis. First, we assumed that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For a more realistic assumption of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we would expect a higher threshold in neighborhood size for failure of voluntary vaccination. In the same vein, the payoff functions are static and do not reflect expected future disease dynamics. Static functions were used because we assumed that individuals do not weigh future outcomes heavily in the face of a current outbreak, especially if there are significant uncertainties about future disease dynamics. However, if individuals did make strategic choices according to expected future disease dynamics, the predictions may change. A second limitation is that we used a static, random network. Outcomes may differ for other types of networks. For instance, in a network with small characteristic path length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Watts1">[46]</xref>, infection and vaccination should percolate through the network more quickly than was the case here, although we do not expect the final state of the network to change. Similarly, networks with scale-free neighborhood size distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-May1">[47]</xref> may exhibit highly variable outcomes due to the large heterogeneity in neighborhood size: an infectious node with many neighbors could lead to a higher epidemic final size in the whole population, whereas a vaccinated node with few neighbors could significantly reduce final size. Finally, if network edges can form and be dissolved, then failure of voluntary vaccination should emerge for a sufficiently high rate of turnover of network edges, regardless of neighborhood size. Future work on behavior-infection dynamics in contact-structured populations should take into account more realistic networks such as those derived from household sizes, sexual behavior surveys, or contact-dairy studies. A third limitation is our assumption that becoming infective coincides with the appearance of recognizable symptoms. For diseases where individuals can transmit before exhibiting symptoms, voluntary ring vaccination would be less successful and we would expect the thresholds of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000280-g001">Figure 1</xref> to shift to the left. This is because individuals may still become infected if they wait to vaccinate until their neighbors exhibit symptoms. For smallpox in particular, some transmission may occur during the prodrome phase of infection, where individuals exhibit non-specific symptoms. However, because the contribution from this phase is relatively small <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Chin1">[48]</xref> and smallpox has a low <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000280.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we do not expect this to qualitatively change our results. A fourth limitation is that we assumed that the vaccine works immediately upon innoculation. This is plausible for smallpox, since vaccination can prevent both disease and viral shedding in individuals if they are vaccinated within three days after becoming infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-1">[31]</xref>. However, if a vaccine requires a sufficiently long time to take effect, waiting to vaccinate until a neighbor exhibits symptoms again may not prevent infection (though it may encourage individuals to vaccinate pre-emptively once disease has entered their local population). Models that accommodate these alternative possibilities could yield different predictions, and it is possible to imagine scenarios of disease propagation through individual-based networks that are analogous to the “race to trace” that has been described for universal smallpox vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000280-Kaplan1">[49]</xref>. Finally, we made the standard game theoretic assumption of “rational” behavior, although humans do not always act in this way. In this context, one implication is that individuals may react differently to outbreaks of a disease that has caused significant mortality very recently, compared to one that has not caused significant mortality in a long time.</p>
<p>Subject to the above limitations, there are <italic>a priori</italic> reasons to think that the basic dynamics illustrated here may describe a wide range of vaccine-preventable diseases that are spread through close contact. At the initial stages of an outbreak, the average prevalence of the disease across the whole population is very low. In a homogeneously-mixing population where infected persons are equally likely to make contacts with anyone in the population, the infection risk to any given individual is therefore also initially small, and individuals do not immediately seek vaccination. The disease thus transmits freely until the average prevalence is high enough to justify vaccinating for the remaining susceptible individuals. On the other hand, in a socially or spatially structured population, the short-term infection risk is heterogeneous across the population: nonexistent for most individuals, but very high for the immediate neighbors of an infected person. Hence, the neighbors of an infected person vaccinate as soon as their neighbor's symptoms appear. Since these effects are likely to apply to a broad range of infections spread through close contact, behavior-infection models of such infections may need to weigh the potential effects of individual-level contact structure.</p>
