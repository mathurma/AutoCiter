        <p>Information processing of the cerebellar granular layer composed of granule and Golgi cells is regarded as an important first step toward the cerebellar computation. Our previous theoretical studies have shown that granule cells can exhibit random alternation between burst and silent modes, which provides a basis of population representation of the passage-of-time (POT) from the onset of external input stimuli. On the other hand, another computational study has reported that granule cells can exhibit synchronized oscillation of activity, as consistent with observed oscillation in local field potential recorded from the granular layer while animals keep still. Here we have a question of whether an identical network model can explain these distinct dynamics. In the present study, we carried out computer simulations based on a spiking network model of the granular layer varying two parameters: the strength of a current injected to granule cells and the concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> which controls the conductance of NMDA channels assumed on the Golgi cell dendrites. The simulations showed that cells in the granular layer can switch activity states between synchronized oscillation and random burst-silent alternation depending on the two parameters. For higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and a weaker injected current, granule and Golgi cells elicited spikes synchronously (synchronized oscillation state). In contrast, for lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and a stronger injected current, those cells showed the random burst-silent alternation (POT-representing state). It is suggested that NMDA channels on the Golgi cell dendrites play an important role for determining how the granular layer works in response to external input.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Intensive studies of Pavlovian delay eyelid conditioning suggest that the cerebellum can memorize a passage-of-time (POT) from the onset of an external stimulus. To account for possible mechanisms of such POT representation, some network models have been proposed to show that granule cells (grcs) in the cerebellar granular layer can exhibit random alternation of burst and silent modes under feedback inhibition from Golgi cells, resulting in non-recurrent generation of active granule cells populations. On the other hand, the oscillation of local field potential (LFP) has been observed in the cerebellar granular layer when animals stay at rest. Some network models have shown that grcs can elicit synchronous spikes in an oscillatory manner. These qualitatively different neural dynamics of the granular layer raises a question of how they can be accounted for by an identical network in the granular layer. Here we report that grc activities of a biologically plausible spiking network model undergo the state transition between synchronized oscillation and random burst-silent alternation, depending on the activation of NMDA channels on the Golgi cell dendrites and the strength of a current injected to grcs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The cerebellar granular layer is one of the stations receiving external stimuli for information processing of the cerebellar cortex. The granular layer is thought to transform spatial patterns of mossy fibers (MFs) input signals into a population of active granule cells (grcs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Marr1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Albus1">[2]</xref>. Recently, Yamazaki and Tanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref> have proposed that the granular layer transforms spatiotemporal patterns of MF input signals into a sparse population of active grcs in the presence of inhibitory Golgi cells (Gocs), and suggested that the passage of time (POT) from the onset of MF signals is represented by the granular layer network.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, when an animal stays at rest without any external stimuli, oscillatory local field potential (LFP) is observed in the granular layer at 7–8 Hz in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Hartmann1">[4]</xref> and at 13–14 Hz in monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Pellerin1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Courtemanche1">[6]</xref>. Although the origin of this oscillation remains unknown, Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref> proposed that grcs and Gocs become active alternatingly and repeatedly by the recurrent connections, and their average oscillatory firing may be observed as the oscillation of LFP.</p>
      <p>There are two distinct dynamics in the cerebellar granular layer: one for the POT representation and the other for the synchronized oscillation. Assuming that the two dynamics emerge from the same neural circuit, one may expect that the strength of external input controls the transition between the two dynamics. However, models accounting for the POT representation do not exhibit the synchronized oscillatory firing of grcs and Gocs but generate spikes randomly for weak external input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref>, whereas models accounting for the synchronized oscillation persistently show the oscillatory state even for strong external input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, it is not trivial to explain the possibility that the two dynamics take place in the same model of the cerebellar granular layer. In this study, we demonstrate that a spiking network model of the cerebellar granular layer can generate synchronized oscillation for weak external input and active grc populations representing the POT for strong external input.</p>

        <title>Overview of the present model</title>
        <p>We build our model on the basis of the GENESIS script of the granular layer model for synchronized oscillation, which was written by Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>. Briefly, we extend the original single-compartment Goc model to a multi-compartment model composed of a soma and a dendrite, on which <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>D</italic>-aspartate (NMDA) channels are distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g001">Fig. 1<bold><italic>A</italic></bold></xref>). We also extend their one-dimensional network structure to a two-dimensional one and set random sparse connections between the model Gocs to the grcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g001">Figs. 1<bold><italic>B</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>C</italic></bold></xref>). We modified the values of the time constant and conductance of GABA<sub>A</sub> channels on a grc soma, and that of the conductance of AMPA channels on a Goc dendrite (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002087.s004">Table S1</xref>) so that simulation reproduces the synchronized oscillation reported by Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Network structure</title>
        <p>We build a model granular layer of the cerebellum using the network structure employed in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref>. That is, 32×32 model Gocs are arranged in two-dimensional grids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g001">Figs. 1<bold><italic>B</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>C</italic></bold></xref>), which is in contrast with the one-dimensional arrangements of model Gocs and grcs in the study of Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>. Our model Gocs are evenly positioned at 35 µm intervals within a square sheet of 1,085×1,085 µm<sup>2</sup>. It was estimated that there are 1,000 times more grcs than Gocs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Palkovits1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Lange1">[9]</xref>. Numerous grcs are connected with a glomerulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Mugnaini1">[10]</xref>. However, simulation with more than 1 million model neurons is beyond the power of our computers. In Yamazaki and Tanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref>, 100 nearby grcs that were assumed to be connected with a glomerulus exhibited similar firing patterns despite each of the grcs independently received noisy signals through MFs. Such redundant activity patterns of grcs suggest that a large number of grcs behave as a single cluster when they receive inputs from the nearest Goc through a single glomerulus. In the present model, for the sake of the economy of computer power, we assume that a single model grc represents a grc cluster composed of about 1,000 neurons.</p>
        <p>We also assume that a model Goc randomly receives 10% of 9×32 PF inputs from model grcs with their dendritic arborization, whose diameter is set at 315 µm. The mean and standard deviation of the actual number of PF inputs to a model Goc were 26.80 and 6.50, respectively. The model Goc, in turn, sends inhibitory inputs to model grcs located within the extent of axonal arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g001">Fig. 1<bold><italic>B</italic></bold></xref>), which is set at 315μm. The number of model Gocs located inside a circle of the diameter of 315μm amounts to 69 by actual counting, which can be roughly estimated by <italic>π</italic>(315/2)<sup>2</sup>/(35-1)<sup>2</sup>+1 = 68.4. In the present model we assume that each grc randomly receives 10% of 69 connections from Gocs. The mean and standard deviation of the actual number of connections were 6.11 and 2.57, respectively. For simplicity, we omit MF inputs to model Gocs.</p>

        <title>Model granule cells</title>
        <p>We use the same model grcs as those adopted by Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref> except for the synaptic channels. Brickley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Brickley1">[11]</xref> reported that inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) can be fitted well with the sum of three exponentials, and that the largest component, which has the decay time constant of 100 ms, contributes to 20% of the IPSPs. Considering this finding, we simulate IPSPs using a double-exponential function with rise and decay time constants of 5 and 100 ms, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Brickley1">[11]</xref>.

        <title>Model Golgi cells</title>
        <p>In Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>, a model Goc was also a single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley unit with realistic ion channels. Their model Gocs received excitatory inputs from model grcs through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) channels with rise and decay time constants of 0.03 and 0.5 ms, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-SilverRATraynelis1">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It has been found that Gocs receive excitatory input signals from PFs through not only AMPA channels but also NMDA channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Dieudonn1">[13]</xref>. However, even when we add NMDA channels on the somas of model Gocs, the NMDA channels do not open effectively to evoke sustained depolarization because the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Wong1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Stuart1">[15]</xref> following the generation of each action potential rapidly decreases the somatic membrane potential. On the other hand, it is known that the dendritic potential tends not to be affected by AHP at cell somas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Wong1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, it has been shown that direct dendritic excitation produces sustained and burst responses although somatic excitation does not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Wong1">[14]</xref>. If NMDA channels really induce a prolonged activation of Gocs, it implies that NMDA channels are located on the Goc dendrites. In this study, a model Goc is represented as a soma and a dendrite whose length is 300 µm (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Ito1">[16]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g001">Fig. 1<bold><italic>A</italic></bold></xref>). The dendrites of model Gocs are assumed to possess AMPA and NMDA channels. We simulate NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with a double-exponential function with rise and decay time constants of 5 and 100 ms, respectively, in accordance with Misra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Misra1">[17]</xref>. Further details are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002087.s004">Table S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>It is known that Gocs are morphologically heterogeneous and their action potentials are variable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Geurts1">[18]</xref>. Although it is likely that random connectivity in the network would have smeared individual heterogeneities, a reversal potential for the leak current at model Gocs is distributed uniformly between −60 and -50 mV according to Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Stimulus and simulation paradigm</title>
        <p>We model MF input signals as a current injected directly to the soma of each model grc, instead of feeding spike trains. Freeman and Muckler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Freeman1">[19]</xref> have reported that the spontaneous firing rate of MFs is as low as 5 Hz, whereas the firing rate increases up to 30 Hz when an animal is stimulated with a tone. We assume that the influx of a current to grcs increases with the frequency of firing conveyed through MFs. In the simulation, we inject a current <italic>I</italic><sub>MF</sub> of 10.7 pA to all model grcs for 2 s. For the succeeding 2 s, we inject a current <italic>I</italic><sub>MF</sub> of 22.7 pA to evoke activity in grcs. Subsequently, we inject a current <italic>I</italic><sub>MF</sub> of 10.7 pA for 2 s again to resume the baseline activity of grcs. In total, we simulate the dynamics of the granular layer network for 6 s. Note that we omit noise in the injected current.</p>

        <title>Simulation tools</title>
        <p>We build the present model and perform numerical simulations using the GENESIS simulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Bower1">[20]</xref>. Differential equations are solved using the Crank-Nicolson method with a fixed time step of 20 µs. When we carry out simulation of eyelid conditioning, we do not need to calculate activities of the granular layer at the same time. We have only to use activity patterns of grcs, which have been stored in a file recorded during the simulation of activities of the granular layer using GENESIS. Because we assume a simple PC model, the simulation does not require the usage of GENESIS that is an expert for simulation of realistic neuron models. Therefore, the simulation program of the model Purkinje cell (PC) for eyelid conditioning, which is just solving differential equations using the first order Euler method with a fixed time step of 20μs, was written in C and C++ programming languages.</p>

        <title>Synchronized oscillation generated by a small current injection</title>
        <p>To confirm the generation of synchronized oscillation at model grcs in response to the injection of a small current (0–2 s), we calculated a normalized autocorrelation function <italic>NAC</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>) of the activities of the grcs using Equation 3 and the value of the oscillation index <italic>OI</italic> using Equation 4. We found a clear oscillation at 9 Hz, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g002">Fig. 2<bold><italic>D</italic></bold></xref>. We also obtained <italic>OI</italic> = 0.836, suggesting robust synchronization of the activities of the model grcs. This oscillation frequency was in the range of frequencies of oscillatory LFP observed in the cerebellar cortex by Hartmann and Bower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Hartmann1">[4]</xref> and Pellerin and Lamarre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Pellerin1">[5]</xref> (7–8 Hz in rats and 13–14 Hz in monkeys). This frequency was lower than that shown by Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref> due to a larger decay constant of γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R)-mediated IPSPs on model grcs (0.31 ms (rise) and 8.8 ms (decay) for Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>; 5.0 ms (rise) and 100 ms (decay) for the present model). These results suggest that the granular layer of the biological cerebellum is in a state of synchronized oscillation under spontaneous MF signal input. The similarity between spike activity patterns at different times decreased with the time interval, but patterns showed weak oscillation associated with synchronized oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g002">Fig. 2<bold><italic>F</italic></bold></xref>). The <italic>NAC</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>) and similarity index <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002087.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for model Gocs were similar to those for model grcs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002087.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The emergence of synchronized oscillation may be interpreted in terms of the following circuit mechanism between grcs and Gocs. The relatively low average firing rate of grcs induced by a small input current evokes the weak depolarization of Gocs, which rarely opens voltage-gated NMDA channels on the Goc dendrites. Thereby, the Gocs elicit spikes only sparsely followed by a refractory period. The low-frequency spike activity of the Gocs inhibits grcs, and the grcs become inactive. After the recovery from the inhibition from the Gocs, the grcs become active due to the sustained external current input and elicit low frequency spikes again. The repetition of such activation and deactivation processes results in the synchronized oscillation of the model grcs and Gocs. This mechanism for the emergence of the oscillatory state is common to that reported by Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The average firing rate of individual grcs was less than half (≈4 spikes/s) of the oscillation frequency (9 Hz) in our simulations. This indicates that not all grcs were activated at every oscillation cycle, which is attributed to the random and sparse connectivity between the Gocs and grcs. When the inhibition of the grcs by the Gocs was removed, the grc firing rate increased to 44 spikes/s. This result suggests that the synchronized oscillation was generated by the network dynamics, rather than the intrinsic mechanisms of individual grcs under the constant current injection.</p>

Different grcs showed different patterns of spike trains. To determine whether the same active grc populations appear more than once, we calculated the similarity index <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002087.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using Equation 6 and plotted it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g002">Fig. 2<bold><italic>G</italic></bold></xref>.

This indicates that the population of active grcs changed gradually with time from the onset of a large current injection without the recurrence of active grc populations, as reported by Yamazaki and Tanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref>. The <italic>NAC</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002087.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for model Gocs were similar to those for model grcs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002087.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). To determine the effect of random connections between model grcs and Gocs, we performed simulations using a modified model in which grcs and Gocs were all connected with each other so that the network did not have any randomness. As a result, activities of these cells exhibited only coherent oscillations (data not shown). This suggests that the random connectivity is a major cause of generating the random alternation between burst and silent modes in grcs and Gocs.</p>
        <p>The random alternation between burst and silent modes of grcs can be accounted for by the following mechanism. The strong activation of grcs by the large current injection vigorously depolarizes randomly connected Gocs, resulting in the activation of voltage-gated NMDA channels on the dendrites of the Gocs. Because of the long decay time constant of NMDAR-mediated EPSPs, the Gocs send sustained inhibitory signals to nearby grcs, so that the grcs become inactive. Then a Goc that receives inputs from these grcs decreases its activity, which reactivates the grcs. However, due to the random connections, the timings of the reactivation and deactivation of grcs are different for different grcs, resulting in the random alternation between burst and silent modes of grcs.</p>

        <title>Reproducibility of active grc populations in POT-representing states</title>
        <p>To confirm that the present model achieves reproducible POT representation for different trials of the strong current injection, we carried out the following simulations. We injected a large current to grcs twice during 2–4 and 6–8 s, whereas we injected a small current at other times. We evaluated the reproducibility index <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002087.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between active grc populations in response to the first and second injections of a large current using Equation 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002087.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> immediately after the onset of the current injection (<italic>t</italic>&lt;50 ms) was 1, indicating a perfect reproducibility. Afterward, it tended to decrease with the duration of the current injection. The perfect reproducibility observed around the onset of the current injection originates in the simultaneous activation of all grcs at the onset followed by strong inhibition from Gocs. This resetting mechanism enables the network to lose its history of activities. Consequently, the present model can represent the POT robustly and reproducibly for different trials of a large current injection.</p>

The synchronized oscillation of grcs and Gocs was unaffected during the injection of a small current to the grcs for 0–2 and 4–6 s. This was observed by the appearance of oscillatory behavior of the normalized autocorrelation function <italic>NAC</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g004">Fig. 4<bold><italic>D</italic></bold></xref>).

As mentioned previously, when the injected current was small, the NMDA channels on the Goc dendrites rarely opened, irrespective of whether NMDA channels were blocked. Therefore, the oscillatory behavior of grcs and Gocs during small current injections was preserved under the blockade of NMDA channels. On the other hand, in response to a large current injection to the grcs for 2–4 s, the grcs elicited spikes at a higher firing rate than in the default case (13 spikes/s → 32 spikes/s) and the spike patterns were random and uniform, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g004">Fig. 4<bold><italic>C</italic></bold></xref>.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g009">Figure 9</xref>, we show spike trains, similarity indices and normalized autocorrelation functions of the network dynamics at eight representative points marked by asterisks in the state map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g008">Fig. 8</xref>. Point 1 is characterized by an extremely high firing rate of grcs without oscillations. Point 1 corresponds to the case of a strong blockade of NMDA channels on the Goc dendrites. Because of the weaker inhibition of grcs by Gocs than the excitation of grcs by the injected current, both <italic>PI</italic> and <italic>OI</italic> had small values (<italic>PI</italic> = 0.075 and <italic>OI</italic> = 0.133), while the average firing rate was high (38.4 spikes/s). Point 2 exhibits synchronized oscillation induced by a small injected current. <italic>PI</italic>, <italic>OI</italic> and the oscillation frequency at point 2 were 0.052, 0.991 and 13 Hz, respectively. Points 1 and 2 are irrelevant to the POT representation. Points 3 and 6 are relevant to the POT representation. In particular, point 3 gives a typical POT-representing state, at which <italic>PI</italic> and <italic>OI</italic> were 0.943 and 0.159, respectively. Also at point 6, the grcs showed a POT-representing state due to the sustained opening of the NMDA channels at a low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. However, <italic>PI</italic> was lower than that at point 3 (<italic>PI</italic> = 0.580 and <italic>OI</italic> = 0.243). Point 4 was located at the transition from a synchronized oscillation state to a POT-representing state, because synchronized oscillation appeared transiently at the beginning and changed to a POT-representing state. As <italic>I</italic><sub>MF</sub> decreased, this transient synchronized oscillation became persistent as observed at point 5 (oscillation frequency  = 7 Hz; <italic>OI</italic> = 0.969), which was caused by the repeated bumping of strong excitation of Gocs mediated by NMDA channels. The lower firing rate of the grcs at point 7 was caused by strong inhibition from the Gocs, which exceeded the excitation by a large current injected to the grcs. Finally, point 8 corresponds to an almost inactive state of the grcs exhibiting neither a synchronized oscillation state nor a POT-representing state, because the injected current is too small and Gocs activated by persistently open NMDA channels inhibit the grcs strongly.</p>

State I to IV are represented by the dynamical states at points 2 and 5, points 3 and 6, point 4 and points 1, 7 and 8, respectively.

        <title>Origin of random burst-silent alternation</title>
        <p>We have shown that a POT can be represented by populations of active grcs, each of which exhibits random alternation of burst and silent modes. This raises a question of what the random burst-silent alternation originates in. Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>, in which synaptic weights of any connections in their network were random, did not show the random burst-silent alternation of grc activities. On the contrary, Yamazaki and Tanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref>, in which the synaptic weights were constant though the connection pattern was random, demonstrated that the random alternation emerged at grcs. Simulations using a modified model in which grcs and Gocs were all connected with each other without connection randomness resulted in only coherent synchronized oscillations of grc and Goc activities. These observations indicate that randomness in synaptic connections between grcs and Gocs is more important than random fluctuation in synaptic weights of these connections for the generation of the random alternation. For the randomness in the external input, Medina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Medina1">[31]</xref> and Yamazaki and Tanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref> assumed that randomly generated spikes were fed to model grcs through MFs in order to demonstrate that a POT can be represented by populations of active grcs. However, the present model with a constant current injection to grcs showed that the random burst-silent alternation does not require noisy input to grcs. Taken together, it is concluded that randomness in the connectivity between grcs and Gocs is a major cause of generating the random burst-silent alternation in grcs and Gocs.</p>

        <title>Influence of Golgi cells on the network dynamics</title>
        <p>Buonomano and Mauk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Buonomano1">[32]</xref> have shown that the precision of a timed CR elicitation became worse with increase in weights of MF synapses on Gocs, whereas activity patterns of grcs became more resistant to noise in MF input signals. In addition, Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref> have observed that the synchronization of grc and Goc activities disappeared at stronger MF synapses on Gocs. These studies imply that the POT-representing states and synchronized oscillation states may disappear when we take into account direct MF inputs to Gocs, which are omitted in the present model. To examine the effects of the MF inputs to Gocs on the dynamical states, we performed additional simulations changing the ratio in strength of the current injected to Gocs to that injected to grcs, which would reflect the weight of MF synapses on Gocs relative to that on grcs, for two cases of a small and large currents injected to grcs. We found that <italic>OI</italic> was predominant over <italic>PI</italic> for any ratio of injected currents between 0 and 2 when the small current (10.7 pA) was injected to grcs, although both indices took small values when the ratio was large (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002087.s003">Fig. S3</xref><bold><italic>A</italic></bold>). For the large current injection (22.7 pA), <italic>PI</italic> was larger than <italic>OI</italic> when the ratio of injected currents was smaller than 0.3, whereas <italic>OI</italic> was larger than <italic>PI</italic> when the ratio was between 0.3 and 1.3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002087.s003">Fig. S3</xref><bold><italic>B</italic></bold>). The additional simulations by assuming a current injection to Gocs as well as grcs showed that there was a finite range of the strength of a current injected to Gocs, in which the POT-representing states or synchronized oscillation states appeared vigorously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002087.s003">Figs. S3</xref><bold><italic>A</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>B</italic></bold>). These results are consistent with Buonomano and Mauk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Buonomano1">[32]</xref> for POT-representing states and Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref> for synchronized oscillation states. Therefore, the dynamical features of the present model are validated for weak MF inputs to Gocs.</p>
        <p>Recently, Dugué et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Dugu1">[33]</xref> have reported the existence of gap junctions between nearby Gocs and suggested that the oscillatory synchronization of Gocs can be induced from the electrical coupling. They also carried out computer simulation assuming the bath application of kainate to model Gocs and demonstrated that the Gocs mutually connected by gap junctions elicited spikes synchronously at 12 Hz. Their network model was composed of model Gocs alone. It is unclear whether the Goc synchronization is preserved when connections with grcs that receive spontaneous spike input through MFs are taken into account.</p>

        <title>Role of voltage dependence of NMDA channels in state transition</title>
        <p>The importance of the voltage dependence of the NMDA channels was confirmed by simulations under various concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which controls the opening of NMDA channels. We observed that the POT-representing states were disrupted by the blockade of NMDA channels increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, whereas the synchronized oscillation states were destabilized by the persistent opening of NMDA channels at a low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Therefore, the NMDA channels are likely to be involved in the emergence of both the POT-representing states and the synchronized oscillation states. When the network was driven by the small current injection to grcs, simulating spontaneous MF spikes fed to grcs, the activities of the grcs were relatively low. Consequently, the excitatory input signals to Gocs were weak and Goc activities were also relatively low. This made the NMDA channels on the Gocs to open less effectively due to their voltage dependence. Thus, the depolarization of Gocs was largely driven by an AMPAR-mediated synaptic current, which resulted in the network behavior similar to that of Maex and De Schutter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Maex1">[7]</xref>'s model. In contrast, when a large current was injected to grcs, simulating strong MF signal input, the NMDA channels on the Goc dendrites opened persistently because of vigorous excitatory input signals from the grcs. This led to the random burst-silent alternation that can represent a POT, consistent with Yamazaki and Tanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Yamazaki1">[3]</xref>'s model. Although the NMDA channels continually opened due to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, synchronized oscillation was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g006">Figs. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002087-g009">9</xref>). Synchronization in grc and Goc activities may appear at delicate balance among randomness in connectivity, the strength of a current injected to grcs, and the voltage dependence of NMDA channels. This problem should be one of the targets of future studies.</p>
        <p>When we assumed the existence of NMDA channels only on the Goc somas, the random burst-silent alternation was not found at grcs even in response to the large current injection (data not shown). Specifically, the grcs did not exhibit persistent silent periods. This was because AHP following spike generation at Gocs quickly closed once-opened NMDA channels on the somas and the Gocs did not elicit burst spikes to produce the persistent silent periods of grcs. To open the NMDA channels for a longer time, NMDA channels should be located on the Goc dendrites somewhat electrically isolated from the somas, as assumed in the present model.</p>

        <title>Predictions based on the model</title>
        <p>Gocs are regarded as playing an essential role in temporal information processing by the cerebellar cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-DAngelo1">[34]</xref>. The present model specifically emphasizes the importance of voltage-dependent NMDA channels on the Goc dendrites. This leads to a prediction that blocking NMDA channels only on Gocs impairs delay eyelid conditioning due to the disruption of POT representation. This prediction may be examined experimentally. NMDA channels on grcs consist of NR1, NR2A and NR2C subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-Kadotani1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-CullCandy1">[36]</xref>, whereas NMDA channels on Gocs consist of NR1, NR2B and NR2D subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002087-CullCandy1">[36]</xref>.
