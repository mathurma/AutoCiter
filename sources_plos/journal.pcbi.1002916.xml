      <abstract>
        <p>Integrating computer simulation with conventional wet-lab research has proven to have much potential in furthering the understanding of biological systems. Success requires the relationship between simulation and the real-world system to be established: substantial aspects of the biological system are typically unknown, and the abstract nature of simulation can complicate interpretation of <italic>in silico</italic> results in terms of the biology. Here we present <italic>spartan</italic> (<underline>S</underline>imulation <underline>P</underline>arameter <underline>A</underline>nalysis <underline>R</underline> <underline>T</underline>oolkit <underline>A</underline>pplicatio<underline>N</underline>), a package of statistical techniques specifically designed to help researchers understand this relationship and provide novel biological insight. The tools comprising <italic>spartan</italic> help identify which simulation results can be attributed to the dynamics of the modelled biological system, rather than artefacts of biological uncertainty or parametrisation, or simulation stochasticity. Statistical analyses reveal the influence that pathways and components have on simulation behaviour, offering valuable biological insight into aspects of the system under study. We demonstrate the power of <italic>spartan</italic> in providing critical insight into aspects of lymphoid tissue development in the small intestine through simulation. <italic>Spartan</italic> is released under a GPLv2 license, implemented within the open source R statistical environment, and freely available from both the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/spartan" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/spartan</ext-link>. The techniques within the package can be applied to traditional ordinary or partial differential equation simulations as well as agent-based implementations.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The integration of computer simulation with current experimental techniques has become a popular approach to aid the understanding of biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Germain1">[1]</xref>. Computational techniques permit exploration of the underlying biological data on which a simulation is based, and complement wet-lab research by facilitating in silico experimentation impractical or impossible to perform using current methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Efroni1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Andrews1">[4]</xref>. Simulations are however abstractions of the biological systems they capture, and this separation must be appreciated in the interpretation of in silico results. Such simulation results may be affected by uncertainty arising from aspects of the biological system that are currently unknown and need to be assumed, and by uncertainty introduced in the implementation of the simulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Helton1">[5]</xref>. We recently noted that for a majority of simulation results in the biological literature, little attempt is made to elucidate how representative a simulation result is in terms of the biological system captured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses have, however, found recent application in exploring the behaviour of biological simulations to appreciate the effect of uncertainty on simulation results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Alden1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Whereas a number of packages have been developed that aid simulation development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Puzone1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-MeierSchellersheim1">[12]</xref> to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive package available for determining how representative a simulation is of its biological system and understanding how in silico results can be interpreted in the context of the biological domain. As such, we have developed spartan (Simulation <underline>P</underline>arameter <underline>A</underline>nalysis <underline>R T</underline>oolkit <underline>A</underline>pplicatio<underline>N</underline>), a toolkit of statistical techniques that aid understanding and analysis of results generated through simulation. <italic>Spartan</italic> is freely available, open-source, and implemented within the R statistical environment. The package provides implementations of previously described statistical analysis techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Saltelli1">[13]</xref> that when brought together provide a comprehensive toolkit to explore the effect uncertainty has on simulation results. Such uncertainty may be present in two forms: aleatory uncertainty that arises through stochasticity inherent in both the biological and simulated systems, and epistemic uncertainty reflecting simulation parameters for which a value has yet to be or cannot be determined as the biological understanding is incomplete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Helton1">[5]</xref>. Appreciating this effect is critical for interpreting simulation results with respect to the biological system under study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>. The use of statistical tools provides evidence of which simulation results can be ascribed to the dynamics of the model of the biological system implemented, an important consideration for retaining confidence in the results of in silico experimentation.</p>
      <p>In previous work we have utilised computer simulation to model the process of lymphoid tissue development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Patel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Alden1">[10]</xref>. Here we demonstrate the use of s<italic>partan</italic> in an exploration of results generated from this simulator: to determine the number of simulation samples required to mitigate stochastic effects and attain a desired level of experimental accuracy, build confidence that our results are representative of biology as opposed to parameterisation artefacts resulting from epistemic uncertainty, and gain valuable biological insight through rigorous statistical analysis of simulation results. Whereas our previous work highlights the need to adhere to a robust method of simulation design and development informed by wet-lab research, our case study shows how spartan can provide a mechanism to integrate simulation results back into wet-lab research.</p>

    <sec id="s3">
      <title>Design and Implementation</title>
      <p>S<italic>partan</italic> was created to provide a comprehensive toolkit of previously described statistical techniques. Four techniques are included, each providing a different means of analysing simulation data to understand the effect of uncertainty on results and to provide biological insight. The first two techniques have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>, but this package includes the first available implementation of these techniques. <italic>Spartan</italic> assumes that calibration has been performed to establish the parameter values that produce a baseline simulation behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>. Such behaviour is measured through a set of simulation outputs (responses) that are of biological interest and can be qualitatively compared with the biological system. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses can then determine the effects of parameter perturbations on simulation responses. As each technique utilises different parameter sampling methods, it is not possible to use the results generated for one technique for any other technique currently in the package. Although Technique 1 is specifically designed for use with stochastic simulations (such as agent-based implementations), techniques 2–4 can be applied for both mathematical (ODE/PDE) and agent-based implementations. For techniques 2–4, spartan provides methods to generate parameter values and analyse the output generated from them. For Technique 4 (eFAST), <italic>spartan</italic> includes a bespoke implementation of the eFAST algorithm rather than makes use of available methods in other packages for reasons of consistency and ability to analyse a range of output from different simulation implementations. As it is not assumed that simulation data is normally distributed, all statistical comparisons that establish significance between sets of simulation responses are performed using non-parametric tests.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>1. Consistency (or Aleatory) Analysis: Understanding Effect of Aleatory Uncertainty</title>
        <p>Prior to any simulator being used as a tool to complement wet-lab investigations, it is critical that the effect of inherent simulation stochasticity on results be understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Helton1">[5]</xref>. To illustrate, in agent-based simulations the use of pseudo-random number generators in dictating agent behaviour can produce different simulation results despite use of identical parameter values. To mitigate the effects of this uncertainty and achieve representative in silico results, replicate simulation runs are necessary. A technique developed by Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref> is provided that establishes the number of replicate runs required to achieve a desired level of experimental accuracy. In contrast to the other techniques in spartan, this need only be applied to stochastic simulation systems.</p>
        <p>Consistency analysis operates by contrasting distributions of simulation responses, all generated using the same fixed set of parameter values and containing identical numbers of simulation samples. By varying the number of samples comprising the distributions, the analysis determines the number required to obtain statistically consistent distributions. Larger sample sizes produce increasingly identical distributions, thereby mitigating the effect of simulation stochasticity on results. In the description by Read et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>, 20 distributions are generated and contrasted for each sample size, but this can be varied within <italic>spartan</italic> to suit particular applications.</p>
        <p>As an example, one could consider analysing sample sizes of 5, 50, 100, and 300 to determine the number of simulation runs required to mitigate aleatory uncertainty. A set of parameter values is fixed and used for all runs. The researcher performing the analysis must then gather 20 sets of simulation results for each sample size being analysed, each containing that number of results. In this example, where a sample size of 5 is being examined, 20 sets of simulation results should be generated, with each containing 5 sets of simulation results. Where a sample size of 300 is being analysed, each of the 20 sets should contain the results of 300 runs. When this is complete, each sample size is analysed in turn. A distribution of median responses for each simulation run is generated for each of the 20 subsets.</p>
        <p>Distributions 2–20 are contrasted with the distribution from the 1st set using the Vargha-Delaney A-Test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Vargha1">[14]</xref>, a non-parametric effect magnitude test that establishes scientific significance by contrasting two populations of samples and returning the probability that a randomly selected sample from one population will be larger than a randomly selected sample from the other. Statistical significance is determined by comparing this result with measures set by the authors of the test: results above 0.71 or below 0.29 indicate a scientifically significant difference between the populations, and 0.5 indicates no difference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Vargha1">[14]</xref>. However <italic>spartan</italic> provides the option to change these magnitude effects if required. A suitable sample size is found where there is no statistical difference between the 1st set of results and the remaining 19 sets. This statistical difference can be seen in plots <italic>spartan</italic> produces for each sample size. A further plot is produced detailing the maximum A-Test score observed for each sample size, easing identification of the number of runs required to minimise difference between simulation results and thus mitigate aleatory uncertainty.</p>

        <title>2. Robustness Analysis: Determining a Simulation's Robustness to Parameter Perturbation</title>
        <p>Any biological simulation will feature biologically-derived parameters for which values are fully or partially unknown: some biological values cannot be determined experimentally, whereas others cannot be represented easily within a simulation. For example, diffusion of a chemoattractant could be implemented using a particular mathematical function for which values cannot be verified, as biological quantities cannot currently be measured. Robustness analysis examines the implications of biological uncertainty or parameter estimation on simulation results. Where a simulation is found to be highly sensitive to such parameters caution must be exercised when interpreting results; they may be artefacts of parametrisation rather than representations of the biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Helton1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Robustness to parameter perturbation is explored using a ‘one at a time’ approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>: each parameter is adjusted independently of others, which retain their calibrated values. The Vargha-Delaney A-Test described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Vargha1">[14]</xref> is employed to determine if changing a parameter value leads to scientifically significant behavioural alteration in contrast to the baseline simulation. This indicates how robust the simulator is to alteration of each parameter, and the points at which parameter perturbations result in significant changes in simulation behaviour. Confidence in the validity of simulation results can be gauged by contrasting this information with biologically accepted ranges of values. The A-Test results for each parameter are presented on a plot, providing easy identification of parameter values that cause a scientifically significant change in simulation response.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3c">
        <title>3. Global Sensitivity Analysis: Identification of Compound Effects through Simultaneously Perturbing All Parameters</title>
        <p>Though robustness analysis elucidates affects of perturbing single parameters, it cannot reveal compound effects that occur when two or more are adjusted simultaneously. The effect one parameter has may rely on the value of another. Global sensitivity analyses reveal such effects, showing how different parameters could be coupled, and can indicate the parameters that have the greatest influence on simulation responses. <italic>Spartan</italic> includes a sampling-based technique that perturbs the values of all parameters of interest simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Saltelli1">[13]</xref> based on a provided range of values for each parameter. Through simultaneous perturbation of parameters, the results of this analysis are highly representative of simulation dynamics. Highly influential parameters indicate the pathways and components that have a substantial effect on simulation behaviour, and in identifying such relationships, this analysis has the potential to offer unique biological insight into the system the model describes. This has the potential to inform future wet-lab investigations by suggesting specific biological components to focus upon.</p>
        <p>A latin-hypercube sampling approach is used to select parameter sets from within these ranges, whilst minimising correlations in parameter values across the sets and ensuring an efficient coverage of parameter space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Saltelli1">[13]</xref>. The methodology used in sampling is described in detail by Read et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Read1">[6]</xref>. Simulations are executed for each parameter set generated, and simulation response values determined. Where necessary these responses will represent an averaged response over a number of runs for a particular set of parameter values. A plot is produced for each parameter-response pairing, revealing correlations between parameter and response values, which are quantified through calculation of Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) and are reported on the plot header. PRCCs account for non-linear relationships between parameter and response, and correct for the effects of other parameters on the response, giving a robust indication of the effect this parameter has on simulation response although others are also being perturbed.</p>

        <title>4. eFAST: Partitioning Output Variance between Input Parameters</title>
        <p>The extended Fourier Amplitude Sampling Test (eFAST) developed by Saltelli et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Saltelli2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Saltelli3">[16]</xref> also a global analysis technique, is a variance decomposition method that partitions the simulation output variance caused by an alteration in parameter values between the input parameters. This provides a statistical measure revealing the proportion of variance that can be explained by perturbing the value of each factor, and thus determines how sensitive the simulation and biological system is to that parameter. Through applying this technique, highly influential pathways can be identified as potential targets for future laboratory investigation.</p>
        <p>For each simulation parameter included in this analysis, a range over which values are to be explored is provided. Taking each in turn, values are chosen for all parameters through the use of sinusoidal functions of a particular frequency through the parameter space, with the frequency of the parameter of interest being varied greatly to that used for its complementary set. A number of parameter values are selected from points along each of these curves, creating a set of simulation parameters for each parameter of interest. An illustration of this sampling approach can be seen in Marino <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref>. The authors note that due to the symmetrical properties of sinusoidal functions, it is possible that the same parameter value sets could be selected. To address this, a re-sampling scheme is encouraged where a phase shift is introduced into each frequency, and sampling repeated using a slightly different curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref>. Selection of the number of re-sample curves and parameter values chosen from the curves is an important aspect of running this algorithm, and it is suggested that the user makes themselves familiar with equations provided in Marino et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref> that aid this decision. Consequently, a number of parameter value sets are created for each parameter of interest, for a particular curve. This process is repeated for an extra parameter, the ‘dummy’, which has an arbitrary value range but no impact on simulation behaviour. This enables a comparison between the impact of each parameter and one known to have no effect on simulation response. As an example, for 7 parameters, plus a dummy, three re-sample curves, and 65 parameter values from points along the curves, 1,560 sets of parameters would be produced. Spartan produces a csv file for each parameter of interest and each curve, containing the parameter value sets on which simulations should be executed. Thus in this example, twenty-four files would be produced, each containing sixty five sets of parameters. For analyses where a large number of parameters are explored, this technique could be computationally expensive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Tarantola1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Ratto1">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Simulation results are analysed taking into account the frequencies that were used to generate the parameter set used. Through Fourier analysis using these frequencies, variation in output can be partitioned between the parameters, giving an indication of the impact each has on simulation response. Using the equations given in Marino et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref>, two sensitivity indexes are calculated for each parameter-response pairing: a first-order (Si) and total order sensitivity (STi) index. The first indicates the fraction of output variance in that response that can be explained by the value assigned to the parameter. The latter indicates the variance in that response caused by higher-order non-linear effects between the parameter and the others under investigation. Although the dummy parameter has no influence on simulation dynamics, the algorithm may assign this parameter non-zero sensitivity indexes due to aliasing or interference effects, or simplifying assumptions the technique makes in calculating each STi index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref>. Reasoning for this is given in Supplemental material that accompanies the description of the technique in Marino et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Marino1">[7]</xref>. A determination of whether a parameter has a significant impact on simulation response is made by examining the sensitivity indexes, contrasting these with the indexes calculate for the ‘Dummy’ parameter. As this is contrasting sensitivity indexes rather than simulation responses, a statistical measure is generated using a two-sample t-test. Spartan produces both a csv file with these statistics and a plot for each simulation response, detailing the Si and STi indexes for each parameter.</p>

        <title>1. Consistency (or Aleatory) Analysis: Understanding Effect of Aleatory Uncertainty</title>
        <p>To determine the number of simulation runs required to obtain a representative result, we analysed sample sizes of 1, 5, 50, 100, 300, and 500 runs.

          <p>Five hundred parameter value sets were generated from the parameter space using the latin-hypercube sampling approach. With results from Technique 1 suggesting 500 simulation executions are required to gain a representative result from our simulation, a total of 250,000 simulation executions were performed to generate the data required for this analysis. Median output responses for each of the parameter value sets were then calculated from the 500 sets of results.

With 1,365 individual parameter sets, this analysis therefore required 682,500 runs in our case. Plots are created for each simulation output response (velocity and displacement), detailing the first-order (Si) and total-order (STi) sensitivity indexes calculated for each parameter of interest. Indications of significance of each parameters sensitivity index, contrasted to those calculated for the ‘Dummy’ parameter using a two-sample t-test, are output to a CSV file in the directory specified by the user prior to running the analysis. For online tutorial 4, spartan produces the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002916-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In our published study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Patel1">[9]</xref>, we utilised our simulator and statistical methods described in techniques one to three, and determined no significant role for chemoattractant factors at an early stage of tissue development. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Results</xref> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002916-g004">Figure 4</xref> examine the same time-point with this additional analysis method, and support these conclusions.

This supports predictions made by use of Technique 3, but counters the accepted view in the literature, where chemokines are known to have an influential role in tissue development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Randall1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002916-Luther1">[20]</xref>.
