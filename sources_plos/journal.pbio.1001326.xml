        <p>NAD(P)H oxidase plays a role in cancer metabolism by providing NAD<sup>+</sup> to support increased glycolysis.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Elevated aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells (the Warburg effect) may be attributed to respiration injury or mitochondrial dysfunction, but the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic significance remain elusive. Here we report that induction of mitochondrial respiratory defect by tetracycline-controlled expression of a dominant negative form of DNA polymerase γ causes a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and increases ROS generation. We show that upregulation of NOX is critical to support the elevated glycolysis by providing additional NAD+. The upregulation of NOX is also consistently observed in cancer cells with compromised mitochondria due to the activation of oncogenic Ras or loss of p53, and in primary pancreatic cancer tissues. Suppression of NOX by chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of gene expression selectively impacts cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to a decrease in cellular glycolysis, a loss of cell viability, and inhibition of cancer growth in vivo. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of NOX in cancer metabolism and suggests that NOX is a potential novel target for cancer treatment.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Glycolysis is a cytoplasmic metabolic process that produces energy from glucose. In normal cells, the rate of glycolysis is low, and glycolysis products are further processed in the mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation, a very efficient energy-producing process. Cancer cells, however, display higher levels of glycolysis followed by cytoplasmic fermentation, and reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation. It was thought that increased glycolysis is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, but how these phenomena are functionally linked was not known. Understanding how these processes are regulated will be essential for developing more effective anti-cancer therapies. Here, we show that induction of mitochondrial dysfunction by either genetic or chemical approaches results in a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. We further show that NADPH oxidase (NOX), an enzyme known to catalyze the oxidation of NAD(P)H, also plays a critical role in supporting increased glycolysis in cancer cells by generating NAD<sup>+</sup>, a substrate for one of the key glycolytic reactions. Inhibition of NOX leads to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro and suppression of tumor growth in vivo. This study reveals a novel function for NOX in cancer metabolism, explains the increased glycolysis observed in cancer cells, and identifies NOX as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic target.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Development of selective anticancer agents based on the biological differences between normal and cancer cells is essential to improve therapeutic selectivity. Increased aerobic glycolysis and elevated oxidative stress are two prominent biochemical features frequently observed in cancer cells. A metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria to glycolysis in the cytosol in cancer was first described some 80 years ago by Otto Warburg, who later considered such metabolic changes as “the origin of cancer” resulting from mitochondrial respiration injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Warburg1">[1]</xref>. It is now recognized that elevated glycolysis is a characteristic metabolism in many cancer cells. In fact, active glucose uptake by cancer cells constitutes the basis for fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), an imaging technology commonly used in cancer diagnosis. In addition, cancer cells exhibit elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which disturb redox balance leading to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Trachootham1">[2]</xref>. However, despite these long-standing observations and clinical relevance, the biochemical/molecular mechanisms responsible for such metabolic alterations and their relationship with mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction remain elusive. Identification of the major molecular players involved in the metabolic switch in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing more effective treatment strategies.</p>
      <p>For many years, studies of mitochondrial respiratory defect usually involve the use of ρ° cells, in which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion is generated by chronic exposure of cells to the DNA-intercalating agent ethidium bromide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-King1">[3]</xref>. While successful, the use of ρ° cells generated by this method as a model for metabolic study has potential complications due to possible nuclear DNA damage by ethidium bromide and thus may compromise data interpretation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Singh1">[4]</xref>. To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations of cellular metabolism, it is important to establish a model system in which the mitochondrial function can be regulated without significant impact on the nuclear genome. Mitochondrion DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) is a key enzyme responsible for the replication of mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Schapira1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Graziewicz1">[6]</xref>, which encodes for 13 critical components of the respiratory chain. Thus, it is possible to specifically impact the mitochondrial respiratory function by selectively suppressing POLG, which is not involved in nuclear DNA replication. Indeed, a dominant negative form of POLG (POLGdn), which contains a point mutation (D1135A) in the coding sequence, has been previously identified and demonstrated to have a negative impact on mtDNA replication, causing respiratory defect after transfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Spelbrink1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Jazayeri1">[8]</xref>. Thus, it is possible to use a gene transfection strategy to selectively impact mitochondrial function without affecting nuclear DNA.</p>
      <p>NOX are a group of membrane-associated enzymes capable of oxidizing NADPH or NADH to NADP<sup>+</sup> or NAD<sup>+</sup>, leading to generation of superoxide by one-electron reduction of oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Griendling1">[9]</xref>. There are seven members of the NOX family in the human genome with unique patterns of cellular expression and conserved structure. They include NOX1 (also called Mox1), NOX2 (gp91phox), NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, and the dual oxidases DUOX1 and DUOX2. Activation of most NOX complexes requires proper assembling of multiple protein components, including p22phox (CYBA), Rac-GTPase (Rac1 and Rac2), p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, NOX organizer 1 (NOXO1), and NOX activator 1 (NOXA1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Takeya1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Takeya2">[11]</xref>. NOX enzymes have been implicated in host defense, regulation of gene expression, ROS generation, and redox signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Bedard1">[12]</xref>. In many cancers, NOX activities are increased and mRNAs are overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Szanto1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Lambeth1">[16]</xref>, but the precise functions of NOX in cancer cell metabolism remain unclear.</p>
      <p>In the current study, we adapted the molecular strategy using POLGdn to generate a tetracycline-inducible cell system as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Jazayeri1">[8]</xref> and used this model system and cancer cells with compromised mitochondrial respiration to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and metabolic alterations and to identify the key molecular players in the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. We discovered an unexpected metabolic function of NOX, which is important for maintaining high glycolytic activity in cells with mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction. We also found that cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction due to the expression of oncogenic Ras or a loss of p53 consistently exhibited elevation in NOX activity and were highly sensitive to NOX suppression. Importantly, the significant increase in the expression of p22phox, a main component of NOX complex, was found in human pancreatic carcinoma, where K-Ras aberrant activation is prevalent. Furthermore, suppression of NOX exhibited significant antitumor activity in vivo, suggesting that NOX can be a potential target for cancer therapy.</p>

        <title>POLGdn Expression Leads to Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Elevated Glycolysis</title>
        <p>To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic changes, we first established an experimental cell model where the mitochondrial respiratory status can be regulated via a tetracycline-inducible system. This model is based on the fact that mtDNA replication is catalyzed by DNA polymerase γ (POLG) and that POLGdn can abolish mtDNA replication leading to respiration defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Spelbrink1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Hinkle1">[17]</xref>. A 4-kb DNA fragment containing the full-length POLGdn gene with a D1135A mutation was constructed into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/TO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which was then transfected into human T-Rex 293 cells to generate a Tet/on inducible system as described in the Materials and Methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, in the absence of doxycycline (Tet/off), the endogenous POLG was readily detected by POLG antibody, but the expression of exogenous POLGdn was not detectable (absence of the FLAG signal), suggesting that this experimental system was tightly controlled without detectable leakage. Addition of doxycycline (Tet/on) to the culture medium induced the expression of POLGdn (detected by anti-FLAG), which remained expressed for over 2 wk in the presence of doxycycline. The induced expression of POLGdn was also evident by the increase of the band intensity detected by anti-POLG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>The expression of POLGdn led to a severe decrease of mtDNA synthesis, as evidenced by a dramatic decrease of mtDNA 2 d after doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine the mtDNA-encoded gene expression, Northern blot analysis was used to measure the level of mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) RNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g001">Figure 1D</xref> showed that the expression of COII RNA was decreased on day 2, almost depleted on day 6, and disappeared by day 10 after POLGdn induction.

        <p>To evaluate the metabolic alterations subsequent to POLGdn induction, we first measured cellular oxygen consumption as an indicator of mitochondrial respiratory capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Xu1">[18]</xref>. Expression of POLGdn caused a time-dependent decrease in oxygen consumption, detectable on day 2 and dramatically decreased on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Associated with this decrease in mitochondrial respiration, the Tet/on cells became highly glycolytic, as evidenced by a significant increase in glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and elevated production of lactate, a metabolic product of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with the active glycolysis, the Tet/on cells showed an upregulation of hexokinase II (HKII), a rate-limiting enzyme of the glycolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This increase in glycolysis seemed effective in compensating the decrease of ATP production in the mitochondria, since the overall cellular ATP levels only decreased moderately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), even on day 12 when respiration was severely suppressed.</p>

        <p>Because O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> can be converted to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the mitochondrial superoxide dismutases (SOD2) or the cytosolic SOD1, we tested the possibility that the increase in cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the decrease in O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> observed in the Tet/on cells might be a consequence of altered SOD activity. Western blot analysis showed that the mitochondrial SOD2 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas the basal expression of cytosolic SOD1 was abundant in the Tet/off cells and was further increased by day 4 after POLGdn induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Concurrently, SOD1 activity was also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the increase in cellular ROS detected by DCF-DA was most likely due to elevated generation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> outside the mitochondria, and such cytosolic O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> was then converted to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the elevated SOD1.</p>

        <title>Upregulation of NOX Is Important to Maintain High Glycolytic Activity in Cells with Mitochondrial Dysfunction</title>
        <p>Since NOX is a membrane-associated enzyme capable of generating ROS outside the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Blanchetot1">[20]</xref>, we then measured the membrane-associated NOX activity of the Tet/on cells in comparison with Tet/off cells, using standard NOX assay described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Griendling2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Heymes1">[22]</xref>.

This increase in NOX activity was inhibited by 10 µM diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a known inhibitor of NOX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Cross1">[23]</xref>, to less than 10% of the original NOX activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, pharmacologic inhibitors of other ROS-generating molecules including NOS inhibitor Nω-nitro-L-arginine mrthyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 100 µM), the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor rotenone (20 µM), and the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol (100 µM) showed no effect on the NOX activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

        <p>The elevated NOX in cells with mitochondrial dysfunction induced by POLGdn suggests that NOX upregulation might be functionally important for these cells. We then used DPI to test if the POLGdn-expressing cells with mitochondrial respiratory defects might be more vulnerable to NOX inhibition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, the Tet/on cells were significantly more sensitive to DPI treatment than the Tet/off cells, evident by a substantial loss of mitochondrial integrity (ability to retain rhodamin-123), a decrease in cell viability (annexin-V/PI double staining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), and an inhibition of cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001326.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). To test whether the elevated NOX gene expression and NOX activity were only limited to the POLGdn Tet/on system, we compared the respiration defective (ρ°) cell line HL60-C6F (C6F cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Pelicano1">[24]</xref> with its mitochondrial competent parental HL60 cell line and observed that the mitochondrial respiration-defective C6F cells showed a significant increase in NOX activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g004">Figure 4F</xref>) and elevated expression of NOX1, NOXA1, and p47phox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistently, C6F cells were also more sensitive to DPI than the parental HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g004">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>
        <p>The above observations suggest that the up-regulation of NOX might be important for the viability of cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. Since respiration-defective cells are highly dependent on glycolysis for cell survival, we tested the potential role of NOX on glucose metabolism by evaluating the effect of NOX knockdown on glucose uptake, ATP generation, and cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> level. siRNA was used to specifically knockdown the expression of the critical NOX components NOX1 and p22phox in both Tet/on and Tet/off cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001326.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). Interestingly, suppression of NOX by siRNA selectively impact cells with mitochondrial dysfunction (Tet/on), evidenced by a significant decrease in glucose uptake and reduced ATP generation, while cells with competent mitochondrial function (Tet/off cells) were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref>), suggesting a potential role of NOX in glucose metabolism in cells that are highly glycolytic such as in the cells with mitochondrial defect. We further measured cellular NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> contents in the Tet/off and Tet/on cells in the presence and absence of NOX inhibition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> were separated by HPLC and eluted at 9 min and 15 min, respectively. The chemical identities of NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> in these HPLC peaks were collected and confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001326.s002">Figure S2C and S2D</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of POLGdn (Tet/on) caused a decrease in NAD<sup>+</sup> by approximately 30% (75.5→53.6 ng/4×10<sup>6</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating an increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption by the high glycolytic activity when mitochondrial respiration was suppressed by expression of POLGdn. Inhibition of NOX by p22phox siRNA knockdown or by DPI caused an additional 40%–50% decrease in NAD<sup>+</sup>, with a corresponding increase in NADH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Besides, cellular NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio was significantly increased in cells with POLGdn expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). The above data suggest that NOX might by important to maintain high glycolytic activity in the cells with mitochondrial defects by supplying additional NAD+ from oxidation of NADH. Indeed, the membrane-associated NOX preparation was able to oxidize either NADPH or NADH as the substrates, and the oxidase activity was decreased by p22phox gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). These data might explain why p22phox knockdown could cause NAD<sup>+</sup> level decrease in the Tet/on cells.</p>

        <p>To evaluate the importance of increased NOX for the survival of HCT116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells, we tested their sensitivity to NOX inhibitor DPI in comparison with the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, after DPI treatment for 24 h, HCT116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells exhibited a round-up morphology and detached, leading to a decrease in the number of viable cells when compared with HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells. To further confirm this different sensitivity, the effect of DPI on mitochondrial transmembrane potential was compared in both cell lines by flow cytometry using rhodamin-123 staining. Substantially more HCT116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells (32%) lost their mitochondrial transmembrane potential after DPI treatment for 24 h, compared to 17% observed in the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001326-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

        <p>To test the role of NOX in cancer cell survival, we stably knocked down p22phox expression in human pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1), using p22phox shRNA lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we established a dominant-negative mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ inducible cell system, which enabled us to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial respiratory defect and metabolic alterations. Unlike ρ° cells derived by chronic exposure of cells to ethidium bromide that could also damage nuclear DNA, the POLGdn inducible cells provide a clean isogenic model system that allowed the induction of mitochondrial respiration suppression under well-defined conditions without causing direct nuclear DNA damage. This model made it possible to monitor metabolic alterations during the shift from oxidative respiration to high glycolysis and to examine the biochemical mechanisms in detail. The use of this cell system in the current study led to a novel finding that NOX was consistently up-regulated when mitochondrial respiration was suppressed by the expression of POLGdn, and this was further confirmed in cancer cells with loss of p53 or expression of oncogenic Ras. Further study showed that such NOX elevation is critical for the maintenance of high glycolytic activity in cells with mitochondrial respiratory defects. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence: (1) NOX expression and enzyme activity were elevated in cells with different degrees of mitochondrial respiration suppression induced by POLGdn, and in cancer cells with mitochondrial defect due to a loss of p53, or under the stress of Ras oncogenic signal. (2) In cells with mitochondrial respiratory defect, a suppression of NOX led to a decrease in NAD<sup>+</sup> level, lower glucose uptake, and reduced ATP content, leading to loss of cell viability. (3) Knockdown of NOX enzyme component p22phox in Panc-1 cancer cells decreased glucose uptake and lactate generation, decreased cancer cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo.</p>
      <p>Cells with mitochondrial respiration defect require a higher rate of glycolysis, and activation of NOX seems necessary to provide additional NAD<sup>+</sup> to support the highly active glycolysis. Our study showed that suppression of NOX in these cells caused a decrease in NADH oxidation and lower cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> level, a decrease in glycolysis and cellular ATP, and a loss of cell viability. Thus, NOX activation is important for providing additional NAD<sup>+</sup> to support active glycolysis. This is a previously unrecognized function of NOX in energy metabolism. The production of NAD<sup>+</sup> by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is traditionally thought to be the main pathway that maintains the supply of NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis. In normal cells with competent mitochondria and a moderate level of basal glycolytic activity, the NAD<sup>+</sup> generated by LDH may be sufficient to support the glycolytic reaction catalyzed by GAPDH. However, in cells with mitochondrial dysfunction that require higher glycolytic activity, upregulation of NOX seems important to provide additional NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that the POLGdn cells not only represent a model system to study mitochondrial respiration defect as shown in other ρ<italic>°</italic> cells, but it also allows us to investigate the metabolic changes with various degrees of mitochondrial dysfunction. The upregulation of NOX was observed not only at the stage when mitochondrial respiration was severely inhibited by POLGdn expressing, but we have also observed NOX activation in the early stage (day 2 of Tet/on) of mitochondrial dysfunction. NOX activation is also consistently observed in cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as HCT116 colon cancer cells that lack p53 and thus have a disruption of cytochrome c oxidase complex (complex IV) in the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Matoba1">[26]</xref>. Synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) is a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53. The alterations of metabolic parameters including lactate generation and cellular ROS, NADH, and ATP levels observed in the HCT116 SCO2<sup>−/−</sup> cell model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Sung1">[33]</xref> were similar to those seen in the POLGdn-Tet/on cells in this study. Interestingly, the Ras oncogene has recently been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction by disrupting mitochondrial complex activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Hu1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Baracca2">[34]</xref>, which is consistent with our findings in this study. Stable transfection of human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells by K-ras<sup>G12V</sup>, induced expression of K-ras<sup>G12V</sup> in T-Rex 293 Tet/on cells, or stable H-ras<sup>V12</sup> transformation in human ovarian epithelial cells led to a significant increase in NOX enzyme activity. Moreover, the protein level of p22phox was found to be significantly elevated in human primary pancreatic cancer tissues. These observations together suggest that NOX up-regulation may be an important cellular adaptive response to mitochondrial dysfunction to enable the increase in glycolytic activity. As such, NOX upregulation may be significant in many pathological processes related to mitochondrial respiratory inhibition, especially in cancer cells where mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities are prominent.</p>
      <p>The molecular mechanisms by which divergent triggers including POLGdn, oncogenic Ras, and loss of p53 cause upregulation of NOX remain unclear. In the study, we observed that the expression of various NOX family members was upregulated in cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent study suggests that SIRT1, a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase, is involved in the negative regulation of NOX1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Li1">[35]</xref>. It is possible that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by various factors would lead to a decrease in cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> content due to active glycolysis that consumes NAD<sup>+</sup>, and therefore release the SIRT1 suppression on NOX1 expression. Further study is needed to investigate this possibility.</p>
      <p>Conventionally, the membrane-bound NOX enzyme complex is considered as ROS-generating machinery in phagocytes involved in the defense against microorganisms and mediating certain inflammatory processes. Subsequently, nonphagocytic NOX family of proteins homologous to gp91phox and other subunits have been shown to generate ROS in nonphagocytic cells and have been thought to contribute to various cancer cell proliferation and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Lim1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Lambeth1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Arnold1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001326-Brar1">[37]</xref>. Our study revealed an important function of NOX in cellular energy metabolism, especially in cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. The ability of NOX inhibition to suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, to abrogate colony formation ability, and to significantly suppress tumor growth in vivo suggests the feasibility to target NOX for cancer treatment. Since pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to many anticancer agents currently used in clinic, targeting NOX may have significant clinical implications and merit further investigation.</p>

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. 100 µl of the supernatant were subjected to HPLC analysis using an anion-exchange column (Partisil-10 SAX, Whatman) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min from 100% buffer A (5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 4.0) to 100% buffer B (250 mM NAH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>+0.5 M NaCl, pH 4.75) over 20 min, followed by another 5 min isocratic 100% buffer A. Pure NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH were used as reference standards and for quantitative calibration. NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH were detected by UV absorbance at 260 nm and 340 nm with retention times of 8.9 min and 15.4 min, respectively. The peaks corresponding NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH were collected according to the standards' retention time, freeze-dried in a lyophilizor, and further confirmed by MALDI-MS analysis (Bruker Daltonics). In HPLC analysis, the amount of cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH of each sample was quantified based on the peak area compared to the standard curve generated by NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH standards.</p>

        <title>Analysis of p22phox Expression in Pancreatic Tissues on Microarray</title>
        <p>Immunohistochemical staining for p22phox was performed on 4-µm unstained sections from the tissue microarray blocks consisting of 105 stage II pancreatic ductal carcinoma and their paired non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue samples from patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenetomy at our institution. The use of clinical specimens for tissue array study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of MD Anderson Cancer Center. To retrieve the antigenicity, the tissue sections were treated at 100°C in a steamer containing 10 mmol citrate buffer (pH, 6.0) for 60 min. The sections were then immersed in methanol containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase for 20 min to block the endogenous peroxidase activity and were incubated in 2.5% blocking serum to reduce nonspecific binding. The sections were then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p22phox (Santa Cruz, 1∶100 dilution) at 4°C overnight, washed, and then incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 60 min. Standard avidin-biotin immunohistochemical analysis of the sections was done according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and photographed using a digital camera attached to the microscope. The staining results were evaluated by a gastrointestinal pathologist. Since all the pancreatic cancer samples showed either negative or diffuse staining for p22phox, the levels of p22phox expression were graded based on the staining intensity as negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). P22phox expression was categorized as p22phox-low (intensity score of 0 or 1) or p22phox-high (intensity score of 2 or 3).</p>

        <title>Assay of in vivo Antitumor Activity of NOX Inhibition by p22phox-shRNA</title>
        <p>The experiments with mouse xenografts were carried out according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Each side of the seven 10-wk-old athymic nude mice received a subcutaneous injection of 5×10<sup>6</sup> Panc-1 cells bearing p22phox-shRNA (p22phox-shRNA, left flank) or control shRNA (c-shRNA, right flank). Tumor size and body weight were measured throughout the experiment. Moribund animals were sacrificed as mandated by the IACUC protocol, and the tumor weight was recorded. Tumor volume was calculated using the equation: tumor volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) = L * W *(L+W)/2 * 0.526.</p>

        <p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Cell Quest Pro software, Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to evaluate the significant difference between control and test samples in flow cytometry analysis. For comparison of the statistical differences of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keul's multiple comparison test was used. All other statistical significant difference analyses were evaluated using Student's <italic>t</italic> test (Prism GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Statistical differences between p22phox expression in benign and malignant pancreatic tissue groups on microarray were evaluated by Fisher's exact test.
