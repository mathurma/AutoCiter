<abstract>
<p>DNA binding proteins efficiently search for their cognitive sites on long genomic DNA by combining 3D diffusion and 1D diffusion (sliding) along the DNA. Recent experimental results and theoretical analyses revealed that the proteins show a rotation-coupled sliding along DNA helical pitch. Here, we performed Brownian dynamics simulations using newly developed coarse-grained protein and DNA models for evaluating how hydrodynamic interactions between the protein and DNA molecules, binding affinity of the protein to DNA, and DNA fluctuations affect the one dimensional diffusion of the protein on the DNA. Our results indicate that intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions reduce 1D diffusivity by 30%. On the other hand, structural fluctuations of DNA give rise to steric collisions between the CG-proteins and DNA, resulting in faster 1D sliding of the protein. Proteins with low binding affinities consistent with experimental estimates of non-specific DNA binding show hopping along the CG-DNA. This hopping significantly increases sliding speed. These simulation studies provide additional insights into the mechanism of how DNA binding proteins find their target sites on the genome.</p>

<p>DNA binding proteins efficiently search for their cognitive sites on long genomic DNA in cells to control biological activities. Recent experimental studies have revealed that the proteins use not only three-dimensional diffusion, but also one-dimensional diffusion (sliding) on DNA for this search process. For a better understanding of this biological process, we need to elucidate the mechanism of sliding. We report here molecular simulations using newly developed coarse-grained protein and DNA models for elucidating the nature of the sliding motions. Our simulation results show that: 1) hydrodynamic interactions between protein and DNA reduce sliding rate by 30%, 2) structural fluctuations of DNA give rise to steric collisions between proteins and DNA, which facilitate sliding motions, and 3) proteins with low binding affinities to DNA can hop along the DNA, resulting in a significant increase in sliding speed. These simulation studies provide additional insights into the mechanism of how DNA binding proteins find their target sites on the genome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In living cells, DNA-binding proteins search for their specific target sites on DNA to initiate many biological processes, such as transcription, repression, activation, etc. How can proteins find their target sites on a long genome DNA? Many experimental and theoretical studies have been done over the past decade to address this issue (see review articles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Tafvizi1">[2]</xref> and references therein). The question as to how proteins find their DNA binding sites arose from the experimental observation that the association rate of the lactose repressor and its target site on DNA was significantly (about 100 times) higher than the expected Smoluchowski reaction rate in three-dimensional (3D) space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Riggs1">[3]</xref>. To explain this discrepancy, Riggs proposed a mechanism that the protein does not rely on 3D diffusion alone for target search, but also non-specifically binds to the DNA at a random location, then undergoes one-dimensional (1D) Brownian diffusion (or sliding) along DNA to their target sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Riggs1">[3]</xref>. This is based on the idea of reducing the dimensionality of diffusion based reactions in biological systems as originally suggested by Adam and Delbeück in 1968 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Adam1">[4]</xref>. This mechanism, so-called “facilitated diffusion” or a “1D/3D mechanism”, was later expanded on by Berg, Winter, and von Hippel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Berg1">[5]</xref>. In their model, DNA binding proteins have three modes for target search: 1) 1D sliding on DNA without dissociation, 2) 1D hopping along the DNA via a series of microscopic dissociation and association events to a nearby location, and 3) jumping or diffusion in 3D for inter-segmental transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Tafvizi1">[2]</xref>. The significant facilitation of the rate that lactose repressor finds its DNA target site can be explained by an acceleration due to the electrostatic interactions between a positively charged site on the protein and the negatively charged phosphate groups in DNA at the low salt concentrations used in the experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Halford1">[6]</xref>. This classical experiment and the idea of facilitated diffusion have driven many experimental and theoretical studies for over a decade. Indeed, single molecule experiments have confirmed 1D sliding motions of several DNA binding proteins along DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Blainey1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Wang1">[12]</xref> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Elf1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Hammar1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Assuming that only 1D sliding and 3D diffusion are at play, a simple analytical analysis gives the association rate of a DNA-binding protein to its target site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Tafvizi1">[2]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003990.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003990.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic><sub>Smol</sub> is the Smoluchowski rate for random association to target site with 3D diffusion, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003990.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average distance in units of base-pairs (bp) moved during a single sliding step. <italic>τ</italic><sub>1D</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>3D</sub> are the average durations of 1D sliding and 3D diffusion in one round of a 1D and 3D search, respectively. The Smoluchowski rate has the form <italic>k</italic><sub>Smol</sub> = 4π<italic>D</italic><sub>3D</sub><italic>bfN</italic><sub>A</sub> with the diffusion coefficient of the protein in 3D, <italic>D</italic><sub>3D</sub>, the spacing between the base-pairs of DNA is <italic>b</italic> ( = 3.4 Å), and the fraction of the protein's surface that contains the reactive binding interface, <italic>f</italic>, and <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> is Avogadro number. With the measured diffusion coefficients of proteins ranging from <italic>D</italic><sub>3D</sub>≈(1–5)×10<sup>−6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and assuming <italic>f</italic>≈0.2–0.5, we obtain <italic>k</italic><sub>Smol</sub>≈10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Tafvizi1">[2]</xref>. The sliding length can be written by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003990.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with a 1D diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub>1D</sub>. This equation demonstrates that binding to a non-specific site on DNA slows down the search process by a factor of <italic>τ</italic><sub>3D</sub>/(<italic>τ</italic><sub>1D</sub>+<italic>τ</italic><sub>3D</sub>) and this slow-down is compensated for by the sliding term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003990.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. By setting <italic>dk</italic><sub>s</sub>/<italic>dτ</italic><sub>1D</sub> = 0 and assuming <italic>D</italic><sub>1D</sub> is independent of <italic>τ</italic><sub>1D</sub>, we found that the maximum rate constant is achieved if <italic>τ</italic><sub>1D</sub> = <italic>τ</italic><sub>3D</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Tafvizi1">[2]</xref>. However, in a bacterial cell, the theoretical estimate for <italic>τ</italic><sub>3D</sub>/(<italic>τ</italic><sub>1D</sub>+<italic>τ</italic><sub>3D</sub>) has range of 10<sup>−1</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>, which is verified by <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Elf1">[13]</xref>. This ratio is far from the optimal ratio in the theory. Additionally, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003990.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is estimated to be in the range of 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> bps <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Elf1">[13]</xref> and is likely less <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Hammar1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, the 1D/3D mechanism does not allow for significant facilitation and may reduce the efficiency of the protein–DNA search in bacterial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Tafvizi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Slutsky1">[15]</xref>. Possible reasons why 1D sliding does not increase the rate of diffusive motion may be related to spatial effects of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Mirny1">[1]</xref>. Thus, despite significant progress in theoretical and experimental approaches, the detailed mechanisms of protein motion along DNA and its biological role are still not well understood. What are the protein and DNA conformations, energetics, and search dynamics that enable efficient target search along genomic DNA in crowded intracellular environments? For better understanding of the search processes at molecular to cellular levels, simulation studies can play an important role for connecting theory and experiment.</p>
<p>Since DNA has a helical structure, one might expect that proteins rotate along the helical groves of the DNA during 1D sliding. Schurr first derived a theoretical expression for an apparent 1D diffusion coefficient of this rotation-coupled sliding by a non-specifically DNA bound protein along DNA based on hydrodynamic theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Schurr1">[16]</xref>. In his model, if the protein is approximated as sphere, the total friction is the sum of translational and rotational friction, in which it is assumed that the center of mass of the protein always remains on the DNA axis. Recently, Bagchi, Blainey, and Xie extended his model to take into account off-axis rotational diffusion of the proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Bagchi1">[17]</xref>. Their model, called the “BBX model”, is expressed by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003990.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003990.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann's constant, <italic>T</italic> is the temperature, <italic>η</italic> is the viscosity of water, <italic>a</italic><sub>pro</sub> is the radius of the protein, <italic>BP</italic> is the distance between two base pairs of DNA, equal to 3.4 Å, and <italic>R</italic><sub>OC</sub> is the separation between the protein center of mass and the longest axis of DNA. The first and second terms in the denominator describe translational friction along the longest axis and rotational friction on the axis, and are the same as in the Schurr's model. The third term in the denominator, an additional term in the BBX model, accounts for the friction associated with off-axis circular translational motion around the axis. This third term is essentially translational friction. The most important consequence of the BBX model is that a 1/(<italic>a</italic><sub>pro</sub>)<sup>3</sup> size dependence of diffusion is expected, in contrast to the usual Stokes-Einstein 1/<italic>a</italic><sub>pro</sub> dependence for pure translational motion. The same group experimentally measured the apparent 1D diffusion coefficients of various size transcription factors by a single molecule analysis <italic>in vitro</italic> and showed the 1/(<italic>a</italic><sub>pro</sub>)<sup>3</sup> dependence of the diffusion coefficients. This strongly suggests that proteins non-specifically bound to DNA undergo rotation-coupled sliding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Blainey1">[7]</xref>. BBX theory predicts a 100–200-fold reduction in a protein's 1D diffusivities relative to their diffusivities in 3D for typical transcription factors modeled as spherical objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Bagchi1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, the diffusion coefficients of most transcription factors predicted by the BBX model are still 2–5 times larger than experimental values, which may be attributed to free energy roughness to sliding that arises from details of the protein-DNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Blainey1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Bagchi1">[17]</xref>. Thus, on average diffusion constants on DNA for most transcription factors seems to be less than that expected for 3D diffusion in the absence of the DNA.</p>
<p>Apart from the theoretical analyses, molecular simulation studies also observe rotation-coupled sliding of DNA binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Givaty1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Terakawa1">[20]</xref>. In those studies, the dynamics of coarse-grained (CG) DNA and protein models were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations in a simplified implicit solvent model. Proteins are modeled by strings of beads representing α carbon atoms of amino acids, with each nucleotide represented by a few beads. These studies provide molecular and atomistic views of the sliding process.</p>
<p>Here, we have developed a CG model for protein sliding along DNA. In our simulations, hydrodynamics interactions (HI) are considered. As is well known from polymer dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Doi1">[21]</xref>, HI can significantly alter the dynamics of macromolecules. Including HI in the simulations makes it possible to compare to the BBX theory of rotation-coupled sliding. We remind the reader that the BBX model assumes that 1) the protein is a sphere, 2) the protein follows a helical track along, and never detaches from, the DNA, 3) HI between the protein and DNA are ignored, and 4) there is no energy roughness along with sliding. Here, we would like to address the following questions: What are the effects of HI between the protein and DNA on 1D diffusion of proteins along DNA? How does DNA flexibility affect 1D sliding? These effects are difficult to handle in the theoretical analysis. We first build CG models of DNA binding proteins and DNA, and then estimate protein-DNA binding affinities in the CG model by an umbrella sampling method. Using the model, we then perform BD simulations under various conditions to answer these questions.</p>

<p>A schematic view of our CG protein and DNA model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003990-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.

To study the effects of HI on the 1D sliding of the CG-protein model, we performed two different types of BD simulations: one with full HI; that is, HI within each CG-protein and DNA molecules as well as between CG molecules are considered. The other is a simulation with only intramolecular HI, where intermolecular HI are neglected. Hereafter, we call the former “with inter-HI” and the latter “without inter-HI”.

The other is “flexible CG-DNA”, where two PP and PB beads at both termini are restrained at their initial positions by a harmonic potential with a force constant of 0.01 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>.

<title>Comparison with theory</title>
<p>In order to compare our simulation results to the theory, we first performed BD simulations using <italic>q</italic>(DBP) = 20 with the restrained CG-DNA model in the absence of inter-HI. With this <italic>q</italic>(DBP), the CG-protein virtually never detaches from DNA during the simulation length due to the protein's very high binding affinity of −30 kcal/mol. In our model, all PP beads have the same charge, and the DNA sequence effect is not considered. Therefore, it is possible that the energy landscape along DNA might be very smooth. These conditions make the simulation closely correspond to the model in the BBX theory. The binding affinity −30 kcal/mol is not biologically relevant. However, our purpose in this section is to compare BD results with the BBX theory. In subsequent analysis, <italic>R</italic>oc is defined as the distance between the DNA axis and the center of diffusion of the CG-protein calculated by the rigid-particle theory.</p>

<title>Effects of HI between protein and DNA, and DNA flexibility on 1D sliding speed</title>
<p>In this section, we try to evaluate the effects of HI between the CG-protein and CG-DNA, and DNA flexibility on 1D diffusion. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003990-t007">Table 7</xref>, the apparent 1D diffusion coefficients of proteins with a <italic>q</italic>(DBP) of 20 estimated by the BD simulations in the presence and absence of inter-HI, and with the restrained and flexible CG-DNA are listed. A representative trajectory of CG-protein sliding dynamics on flexible DNA in the absence of inter-HI is shown in Movie S2. Inter-HI reduce the 1D diffusivity by 30% and 40% on average over three different CG-protein sizes for both the restrained and flexible CG-DNA, respectively. Thus, the implication is that inter-HI effects are quite robust and insensitive to details. This reduction could be explained by correlated motions between the CG-protein and DNA models caused by inter-HI. The flexibility of CG-DNA increases 1D diffusivity by factors of 2.6 and 2.1 on average over three different CG-protein sizes in the absence and presence of inter-HI, respectively. This mechanism will be discussed below.</p>

<title>Effect of binding affinity of the protein on its 1D sliding</title>
<p>Finally, the effects of charge <italic>q</italic>(DBP) on 1D sliding rate are examined. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003990-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, representative trajectories in Z position of the model CG-proteins with various <italic>q</italic>(DBP) and <italic>a</italic>(PBP) = 40 Å are shown, where the restrained CG-DNA molecules were used. During 25 µs BD simulations, the CG-protein with <italic>q</italic>(DBP) of 7 to 10 hopped along the CG-DNA molecule (see Movie S3 that shows hopping of the CG-protein). This hopping is prominent for smaller <italic>q</italic>(DBP) values. This trend was not changed for the simulations with the flexible CG-DNA model. Apparent 1D diffusion coefficients of the CG-protein with <italic>a</italic>(PBP) = 40 Å and various <italic>q</italic>(DBP) with the restrained and flexible CG-DNA in the presence and absence of inter-HI are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003990-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. The CG-proteins with smaller <italic>q</italic>(DBP) values (&lt;10) tend to slide quickly due to hopping for both CG-DNA models. For <italic>q</italic>(DBP)&gt;10, <italic>D</italic><sub>1D</sub> reached the same lower bound for both CG-DNA models. CG-proteins with <italic>q</italic>(DBP) = 8 to 10 have binding affinities within experimental estimates of non-specific DNA binding. Those proteins in our model showed hopping along DNA. Direct observations of the hopping by single molecule experiments are currently very difficult due to the limited experimental resolution. Our simulation supports the possibility of hopping for non-specifically DNA bounded proteins initially envisioned in the theory.</p>

<p>Reduction due to inter-HI was observed for the whole range of <italic>q</italic>(DBP), which was evident for the larger <italic>q</italic>(DBP).

The CG-proteins with <italic>a</italic>(PBP) = 30 Å and 50 Å show almost similar results for the reduction by inter-HI and acceleration by fluctuations. Regardless of inter-HI, 1D diffusion for the CG-protein with <italic>q</italic>(DBP) = 15 and 20 in the system with flexible CG-DNA are 2 to 3 times faster than those with same charge values as well as for <italic>q</italic>(DBP) = 10 in the restrained CG-DNA model.

<title>Implications of simulation results to experiments and limitations of the CG-model</title>
<p>Free energy roughness along the sliding path caused by the sequence-dependent atomistic interactions, e.g. hydrogen bonding, is also considered to be an important factor for reducing 1D diffusivity of the DNA bound protein. This effect is often evaluated by the Zwanzig formula for diffusion in a rough potential in 1D space, in which the reduction factor is written as exp[(−<italic>ε</italic>/<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>)<sup>2</sup>], with energy roughness <italic>ε</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Zwanzig1">[39]</xref>. This reduction is very sensitive to <italic>ε</italic>. From the Zwanzig formula and experimental results on apparent diffusion coefficients of several DNA binding proteins, <italic>ε</italic> was estimated 1.1±0.2 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Blainey1">[7]</xref>, which means a reduction factor of 0.3. In this analysis, all sources of reduction except for helical diffusion are assumed to be due to energy roughness. However, as seen in this work, inter-HI decrease and DNA fluctuation increase the diffusivity of proteins along DNA</p>
<p>Here, the RPY tensor was employed to represent HI between the CG-protein and CG-DNA models. However, the RPY tensor only includes the far-field part of hydrodynamic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Rotne1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Yamakawa1">[24]</xref>. A recent simulation study of the association of two non-polar model objects clearly showed that at short distances (&lt;1–2 nm) molecular scale effects dominate, giving rise to deviations from continuum hydrodynamic theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Li1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Morrone1">[42]</xref>. Even though a more sophisticated hydrodynamic model was used, the deviation from the atomistic simulation results was not eliminated. Therefore, we may need to find a better description of HI at short distances. However, we believe that our simulation results using the RPY tensor still provide the important qualitative features of HI. Finally, our BD simulations show the possibility that DNA structural fluctuations enhance 1D diffusion of DNA binding proteins by steric collisions between the protein and DNA. However, since proteins are also flexible, this effect may be damped.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this work, we have developed CG models of DNA binding protein and DNA for dissecting the sliding mechanisms of a protein along the DNA. By considering HI we could compare our simulation results with the theoretical model of rotation coupled sliding along helical path of DNA proposed by Bagchi, Blainey, and Xie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Bagchi1">[17]</xref>. This makes it possible to elucidate the relative importance of hydrodynamic forces between the protein and DNA, DNA flexibility, and binding affinity of the protein to the DNA on 1D diffusivity of the protein along the DNA. Our simulations under conditions similar to the BBX model showed that 1D diffusivity obtained from the BD simulations using our model are 1.2–2.2 times faster than theoretical estimates. This discrepancy is mainly due to a low rotational friction of the CG-protein in our model compared to the theoretical treatment in BBX model. Second, BD simulations with intermolecular HI represented by the RPY tensor show that HI reduce 1D diffusivity by 30%. Third, a CG-protein whose binding affinity to CG-DNA is in the range of experiment, −5 to −10 kcal/mol, shows hopping along DNA. This results in an increase of its apparent 1D diffusion coefficients. Direct observations of the hopping by single molecule experiments are currently very difficult due to the limited time and space resolutions in experiments.</p>
<p>The model developed in this work is quite simple, but still we can do “experiments” to elucidate the sliding mechanisms of DNA binding proteins by changing several parameters. Early BD simulation work on protein diffusion in concentrated DNA solutions using a CG model reasonably well reproduce experimental results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Dwyer1">[43]</xref>, where the protein and DNA are represented one sphere and strings of beads, respectively, and electrostatic interactions are calculated from a Debye-Hückel potential. This work also shows usefulness of a very simple CG model to analyze the dynamics of macromolecules. In this work, we have only changed the effective charge parameter of the CG-DNA binding protein to reproduce the biologically relevant binding affinity. However, since HI are long-range effects and the dominant effect is insensitive to shape of the molecule, we believe that effects of HI on protein sliding observed in our BD simulation would be seen in the simulations with different particle radii and higher-resolution models.</p>
<p>Inclusion of HI in BD simulations is often a computational bottleneck to large-scale simulations. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a Krylov subspace method for computing correlated Brownian noise vectors which scales as <italic>O</italic>(<italic>N</italic><sup>2</sup>) with an <italic>N</italic> particle system, whereas an <italic>O</italic>(<italic>N</italic><sup>3</sup>) computation is required in a conventional BD algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-Ando1">[44]</xref>. The Krylov method with a particle-mesh Ewald method, which is based on fast-Fourier transform for computing hydrodynamic effects, enables BD simulations with <italic>O</italic>(<italic>N</italic>log<italic>N</italic>) scaling in computation and <italic>O</italic>(<italic>N</italic>) memory storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003990-X1">[45]</xref>. Combining these advance BD algorithms and the CG model developed here would give us a possibility to perform large-scale BD simulations of DNA binding proteins in a crowded intracellular environment, which should enable a deeper understanding of the experimental results. These simulations are currently underway.</p>
