				<article-title>Uncovering the Ancient Source of Immune System Variety</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The V(D)J recombination reaction in jawed vertebrates is catalyzed by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, which are believed to have emerged approximately 500 million years ago from transposon-encoded proteins. Yet no transposase sequence similar to RAG1 or RAG2 has been found. Here we show that the approximately 600-amino acid “core” region of RAG1 required for its catalytic activity is significantly similar to the transposase encoded by DNA transposons that belong to the <italic>Transib</italic> superfamily. This superfamily was discovered recently based on computational analysis of the fruit fly and African malaria mosquito genomes. <italic>Transib</italic> transposons also are present in the genomes of sea urchin, yellow fever mosquito, silkworm, dog hookworm, hydra, and soybean rust. We demonstrate that recombination signal sequences (RSSs) were derived from terminal inverted repeats of an ancient <italic>Transib</italic> transposon. Furthermore, the critical DDE catalytic triad of RAG1 is shared with the <italic>Transib</italic> transposase as part of conserved motifs. We also studied several divergent proteins encoded by the sea urchin and lancelet genomes that are 25%−30% identical to the RAG1 N-terminal domain and the RAG1 core. Our results provide the first direct evidence linking RAG1 and RSSs to a specific superfamily of DNA transposons and indicate that the V(D)J machinery evolved from transposons. We propose that only the RAG1 core was derived from the <italic>Transib</italic> transposase, whereas the N-terminal domain was assembled from separate proteins of unknown function that may still be active in sea urchin, lancelet, hydra, and starlet sea anemone. We also suggest that the RAG2 protein was not encoded by ancient <italic>Transib</italic> transposons but emerged in jawed vertebrates as a counterpart of RAG1 necessary for the V(D)J recombination reaction.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The immune system of jawed vertebrates detects and destroys foreign invaders, including bacteria and viruses, by a specific response to an unlimited number of antigens expressed by them. The antigens can be identified after they are specifically bound by surface receptors of vertebrate B and T immune cells (BCRs and TCRs, respectively). Because the vast repertoire of BCRs and TCRs cannot be encoded genetically, ancestors of jawed vertebrates adopted an elegant combinatorial solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b01">1</xref>]. The variable portions of the BCR and TCR genes are composed of separate V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) segments, which are represented by fewer than a few hundred copies each. In a B and T cell site-specific recombination reaction, commonly known as V(D)J recombination, one V, one D, and one J segment are joined together into a single exon encoding the variable antigen-binding region of the receptor. In addition to this combinatorial diversity, further diversity is generated by small insertions and deletions at junctions between the joined segments. In V(D)J recombination, DNA cleavage is catalyzed by two proteins encoded by the recombination-activating genes, approximately 1040-amino acid (aa) RAG1 and approximately 530-aa RAG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b03">3</xref>]. The site specificity of the recombination is defined by the binding of RAG1/2 to RSSs flanking the V, D, and J segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b04">4</xref>]. All RSSs can be divided into two groups, referred to as RSS12 and RSS23, and consist of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by a variable spacer either 12 ± 1 (RSS12) or 23 ± 1 (RSS23) bp long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b04">4–7</xref>].</p>
      <p>During V(D)J recombination, RAG1/2 complex binds one RSS12 and one RSS23, bringing them into juxtaposition, and cuts the chromosome between the RSS heptamers and the corresponding V and D, D and J, or V and J coding segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b08">8</xref>]. A rule requiring that efficient V(D)J recombination occur between RSS12 and RSS23 is known as the “12/23” rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b01">1</xref>]. Even prior to the discovery of RAG1 and RAG2, it had been suggested that the first two RSSs were originally terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of an ancient transposon whose accidental insertion into a gene ancestral to BCR and TCR, followed by gene duplications, triggered the emergence of the V(D)J machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b04">4</xref>]. Later, this model was expanded by the suggestion that both RAG1 and RAG2 might have evolved from a transposase (TPase) that catalyzed transpositions of ancient transposons flanked by TIRs that were precursors of RSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b09">9</xref>]. This model has received additional support through observations of similar biochemical reactions in transposition and V(D)J recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b11">11</xref>]. Finally, it was demonstrated that RAG1/2 catalyzed transpositions of a DNA segment flanked by RSS12 and RSS23 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b13">13</xref>] and in vivo in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b14">14</xref>]. In vertebrates, in vivo RAG-mediated transpositions are strongly suppressed, probably to minimize potential harm to genome function. So far, only one putative instance of such a transposition has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b15">15</xref>]. However, given the lack of significant structural similarities between RAGs and known TPases, the “RAG transposon” model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b16">16</xref>] remained unproven. Here we demonstrate that the RAG1 core and RSSs were derived from a TPase and TIRs encoded by ancient DNA transposons from the <italic>Transib</italic> superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>The <italic>Transib</italic> superfamily is one of ten superfamilies of DNA transposons detected so far in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>]. Like other DNA transposons, <italic>Transib</italic> transposons exist as autonomous and nonautonomous elements. The autonomous <italic>Transib</italic> transposons are 3–4 kb long and code for an approximately 700-aa TPase that is not similar to TPases from any other transposon superfamilies. Computational analysis of <italic>Transib</italic> elements, including their numerous insertions into copies of other transposons, demonstrated that <italic>Transib</italic> transposons are flanked by 5-bp target site duplications (TSDs), which also distinguishes this superfamily from all the others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>]. <italic>Transib</italic> transpositions are expected to be catalyzed by the binding of the TPase to TIRs of autonomous and nonautonomous transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>]. As discussed in this paper, in addition to the fruit fly <italic>(Drosophila melanogaster)</italic> and African malaria mosquito <italic>(Anopheles gambiae)</italic> genomes, in which <italic>Transib</italic> transposons were originally discovered, these genes are also present in diverse animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>), including other species of fruit fly (e.g., <italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura, Drosophila willistoni</italic>), yellow fever mosquito <italic>(Anopheles aegypti),</italic> silkworm <italic>(Bombyx mori),</italic> red flour beetle <italic>(Tribolium castaneum),</italic> dog hookworm <italic>(Ancylostoma caninum),</italic> freshwater flatworm <italic>(Schmidtea mediterranea),</italic> hydra <italic>(Hydra magnipapillata),</italic> sea urchin <italic>(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus),</italic> and soybean rust <italic>(Phakopsora pachyrhizi).</italic> Genomes of plants and vertebrates seem to be free of any recognizable <italic>Transib</italic> transposons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

Red circles mark species in which <italic>Transib</italic> TPases were found. Gray squares indicate RAG2; orange and blue ellipses show the RAG1 core and RAG1 N-terminal domain, respectively. Overall taxonomy, including common and Latin names, is reported on the right side of the figure. A question mark at the lamprey lineage indicates insufficient sequence data. A lack of any labels means that the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase and RAG1/2 are not present in the sequenced portions of the corresponding genomes. Among branches lacking <italic>Transib</italic> TPases, only lamprey and crocodile genomes are not extensively sequenced to date. In sea anemone, the RAG1 core–like protein is capped by the ring finger motif, which also forms the C-terminus in the RAG1 N-terminal domain. In fungi, the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase was detected in soybean rust only.</p>

        <title>Detection of Similarity between <italic>Transib</italic> TPases and RAG1</title>
        <p>Using protein sequences of seven known <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (Transib1 through Transib4 and Transib1_AG through Transib3_AG from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <italic>A. gambiae,</italic> respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>] as queries in a standard BLASTP search against all GenBank proteins, we found that the approximately 60-aa C-terminal portion of the Transib2_AG TPase was 35%−38% identical to the C-terminal portion of the RAG1 core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). However, this similarity was only marginally significant (E = 0.07 where the E-value is an expected number of sequences matching by chance; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030181-t001">Table 1</xref>). In another search against GenBank, using PSI-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b18">18</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) with the Transib2_AG TPase as a query, we found that two unclassified proteins (GenBank gi 30923617 and 30923765; annotated as hypothetical proteins) and RAG1s constituted the only group of any GenBank proteins similar to the Transib2_AG TPase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030181-t001">Table 1</xref>). The statistical significance of similarity between the TPase and RAG1s was measured by E<sub>i</sub> = 0.025, where E<sub>i</sub> is the E-value threshold for the first inclusion of RAG1 sequences into the PSI-BLAST iterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b18">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The observed improvement in significance of the <italic>Transib</italic>/RAG1 similarity (from E = 0.07 in BLASTP to E<sub>i</sub> = 0.025 in PSI-BLAST; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030181-t001">Table 1</xref>) was due to the fact that both 151-aa and 123-aa hypothetical GenBank proteins were apparent remnants of <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (approximately 40% identity to the Transib2_AG TPase, E &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup> in BLASTP). The RAG1 proteins appeared to be more similar to the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) created by PSI-BLAST based on multiple alignment of the Transib2_AG TPase and two <italic>Transib</italic> TPase-like proteins, than to the solo Transib2_AG TPase in the BLASTP search.</p>

        <p>Given the latter observation, we decided to improve the quality of the PSSM constructed by PSI-BLAST for different <italic>Transib</italic> TPase sequences. To achieve that, we combined protein sequences of the seven known <italic>Transib</italic> TPases with the set of all GenBank proteins. As a result, E<sub>i</sub>-values for matches of RAG1s to a new PSSM based on alignment of nine <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (the two GenBank TPase-like proteins plus seven added TPases) noticeably dropped in comparison with the E<sub>i</sub>-values obtained for the PSSM constructed in the previous step based on alignment of the three TPases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030181-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To support the observation that E<sub>i</sub>-values of matches between RAG1s and the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase PSSM decrease as the number of TPase sequences used for construction of the PSSM increases, we identified six new <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (Transib5, Transib3_DP, Transib4_DP, Transib1_AA, Transib2_AA, Transib3_AA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). During the next step of the PSI-BLAST analysis, the original GenBank set was combined with 13 <italic>Transib</italic> TPases. Again, E<sub>i</sub>-values of matches between RAG1s and the new PSSM derived from multiple alignment of 15 <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (the two GenBank proteins plus all our TPases) were much smaller (approximately 10<sup>−6</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030181-t001">Table 1</xref>) than those obtained based on the PSSM constructed from the nine TPases at the preceding step (approximately 10<sup>−3</sup>–10<sup>−2</sup>). In the final step, we identified one more set of five new <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (Transib1_DP, Transib2_DP, Transib4_AA, Transib5_AA, and Transib1_SP). When all 18 TPases were combined with the original GenBank set, the E<sub>i</sub> values of matches between RAG1s and the <italic>Transib</italic> PSSM dropped significantly further (10<sup>−9</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030181-t001">Table 1</xref>). During the final revision of this manuscript, we identified an intermediate RAG1-like sequence in <italic>Hydra magnipapillata,</italic> called RAG1L_HM, which is significantly similar to both RAG1 and <italic>Transib</italic> TPase, as shown later. This direct result represents an independent validation of our analysis.</p>
        <p>The PSI-BLAST PSSM of <italic>Transib</italic> TPases approximates conservation/variability of the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase consensus sequence. The more diverse the TPases used in determining the PSSM, the more accurate is the approximation; some of the insect <italic>Transib</italic> TPases are less than 30% identical to each other, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The RAG1 E<sub>i</sub> values decreased as the number of <italic>Transib</italic> TPases used for the PSSM construction increased due to the fact that RAG1 evolved from a <italic>Transib</italic> TPase. In all cases, the E values obtained after several rounds of iterations were less than 10<sup>−20</sup> at the point of convergence. Nearly the entire sequences of several <italic>Transib</italic> TPases, excluding their 100–140-aa N-terminal domains, converged with an approximately 600-aa portion of RAG1 defined by positions approximately 360–1010 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). This portion of RAG1 corresponds to the “RAG1 core,” hereafter numbered relative to human RAG1 (residues 387–1011), which along with RAG2 is known to be sufficient to perform V(D)J cleavage even after deletions of the 383-aa N-terminal and 32-aa C-terminal portions of RAG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b20">20</xref>].</p>

        <p>During studies reported here, we identified 11 additional new families of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons and TPases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>) that are well preserved in the genomes of fruit flies (<italic>Transib5</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster;</italic> and <italic>Transib1_DP, Transib2_DP, Transib3_DP,</italic> and <italic>Transib4_DP</italic> in <italic>D. pseudoobscura)</italic>, mosquitoes <italic>(Transib1_AA, Transib2_AA, Transib3_AA, Transib4_AA,</italic> and <italic>Transib5_AA</italic> from <italic>A. aegypti)</italic> and sea urchin <italic>(Transib1_SP).

A well-preserved 4132-bp <italic>Transib1_SP</italic> element (contig 7839, positions 376–4506) is flanked by a 5-bp 
					CGGCG TSD, and it encodes a 676-aa TPase (two exons) that is most similar to the <italic>Transib2</italic> TPase (34% identity). Based on the currently available sequence data, we also reconstructed portions of TPases that were missed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Using the Transib1_SP TPase as a query in TBLASTN searches against all GenBank sections (NR, HTGs, WGS, dbGSS, dbEST, dbSTS, and Trace Archives) we also found diverse <italic>Transib</italic> TPases in silkworm, red flour beetle, dog hookworm, freshwater flatworm, soybean rust, and hydra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>).

        <p>The C-terminal domain of RAG1 (residues 764–1011) is the portion of RAG1 that is most conserved between RAG1 and <italic>Transib</italic> TPases. In addition to the catalytic activity attributed to the last residue of the DDE triad, this domain has a strong nonspecific DNA-binding affinity because it binds to coding DNA upstream of the RSS heptamer, and is thought to be involved in RAG1 dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b27">27</xref>]. This domain is predicted to function analogously in <italic>Transib</italic> transposons. Several other motifs conserved in <italic>Transib</italic> TPases and RAG1 include aa residues that have been shown experimentally to be important for specific functions in V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Based on this information, the function of these motifs in <italic>Transib</italic> TPases is expected to be similar to that in RAG1. Among the most conserved motifs, motif 5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>) is of particular interest because its function is not known yet but is expected to play a role both V(D)J recombination and <italic>Transib</italic> transposition.</p>
        <p>In conjunction with detailed studies of the <italic>Transib</italic> superfamily, we also analyzed the remaining nine known superfamilies of DNA transposons defined by diverse TPases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030181-t001">Table 1</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b24">24</xref>]). Some of these TPases, including <italic>Mariner, Harbinger</italic>, <italic>P</italic>, and <italic>hAT</italic>, also contain the catalytic DDE triad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b23">23</xref>]<italic>.</italic> However, based on PSI-BLAST searches, no significant similarities between these nine TPases and RAG1 protein were found (data not shown). Therefore, given that the only significant similarity of the RAG1 core was to the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase, the RAG1 core was re-confirmed as belonging to the <italic>Transib</italic> superfamily.</p>
        <p>In addition to the statistically significant similarity between the approximately 600-aa RAG1 core and <italic>Transib</italic> TPases, there are two other lines of evidence suggesting evolution of the V(D)J machinery from <italic>Transib</italic> DNA transposons. They include the characteristic TSDs and structure of the TIRs discussed in the next two sections.</p>

        <title>Similar Length of TSDs and Target Site Composition in <italic>Transib</italic> and RAG1/2-Mediated Transpositions</title>
        <p>It has been known that RAG1-mediated transposition in vitro, both intermolecular and intramolecular, is most frequently accompanied by 5-bp TSDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b13">13</xref>]. In one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b12">12</xref>], 35 of 38 (92%) TSDs generated during RAG-mediated intermolecular transposition were 5 bp long, and the remaining 8% were either 4 or 3 bp long. Also, 69% of 36 TSDs recovered during RAG-mediated intramolecular transpositions were 5 bp in length; of the remaining ones, 28% were 4 bp and 3% were 3 bp long. In another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b13">13</xref>], six of six TSDs detected in the intermolecular transposition were 5 bp long. Intramolecular transposition mediated by murine RAG1/2 proteins was also studied recently in vivo in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b14">14</xref>]. Again, 60% of TSDs recovered in 26 events were 5 bp long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b14">14</xref>]. Given the predominance of 5-bp TSDs, it is striking that <italic>Transib</italic> transposons belong to the only superfamily of eukaryotic DNA transposons with 5-bp TSDs generated upon insertions into the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b24">24</xref>]. To illustrate the characteristic 5-bp TSDs, we show copies of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons with intact 5′ and 3′ TIRs from diverse families of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons present in the <italic>D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, A. gambiae,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. purpuratus</named-content> genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Moreover, some families show high target site specificity, e.g., <italic>Transib-N1_AG</italic> and <italic>Transib-N2_AG</italic> integrate preferentially at cCASTGg and cCAWTGc, respectively (TSDs are capitalized). RAG1/2-mediated transpositions also show significant target specificity, presumably reflecting the original specificity of the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b12">12</xref>]. Indigenous properties of the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase, that were not related directly to RAG1 functions, including those responsible for the precise 5-bp length of TSDs, might have been altered during evolution of RAG1, leading to occasional 4-bp and 3-bp TSDs that are atypical for <italic>Transib</italic> transposons. Both RAG1/2-mediated and <italic>Transib</italic> transpositions show strong preference for GC-rich target sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b12">12–14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b32">32</xref>], even though genomes hosting <italic>Transib</italic> transposons are AT-rich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Interestingly, the 6,690-bp contig 6797 harbours two additional defective pseudogenes coding for different RAG1 core–like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We also identified a 597-aa protein sequence encoded by a single open reading frame (contig 29068, positions 1157–2944), which is 28% identical to nearly the entire RAG1 core (positions 461–1002 in the human RAG1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Extensive analysis of the flanks failed to show any hallmarks of putative transposons that might be associated with this RAG1-like protein, and we did not find any evidence indicating that other RAG1 core–like proteins are encoded by transposable elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

        <p>Using FGENESH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b33">33</xref>], we detected that the RAG1 core–like open reading frame (ORF) in the contig 29068 forms a terminal exon (positions 1154–2947) of an incomplete hypothetical gene composed of two exons (internal and terminal; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>). The 3′ terminal portion of the internal exon encodes a protein sequence that appears to be marginally similar to an approximately 50-aa fragment of the RAG1 core (positions 394–454 in human RAG1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>). The RAG1 core–like protein in whole genome shotgun (WGS) contig 12509 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g005">Figure 5</xref>) also seems to be encoded by the last exon starting at position 1650 of a hypothetical RAG1-like gene. Although the two proteins are only 38% identical to each other, they share common features: (1) their N-terminal portions are missing and the RAG1-like sequences start at positions 17 or 18; (2) in both proteins the first aa residue overlaps with the acceptor splice site; and (3) their similarity to RAG1 starts at positions corresponding to position 470 of the human RAG1. Remarkably, the acceptor splice site positions in the sea urchin RAG1 core–like proteins closely correspond to those in RAG1 from teleosts (i.e., most of the living ray-finned or bony fish), in which RAG1 is split by an intron at position homologous to Gly<sub>460</sub> in human RAG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b34">34</xref>].</p>
        <p>Using the same RAG1 query sequences in a TBLASTN search against WGS trace sequences from the lancelet <italic>(Branchiostoma floridae)</italic> genome recently sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we found that the lancelet genome encodes protein sequences approximately 35% identical to the RAG1 core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>; RAG1L_BF; BLASTP E-value is equal to 10<sup>−34</sup>). Again, as in the case of the sea urchin sequences, the lancelet RAG1 core–like elements show no hallmarks of transposons (data not shown). However, unlike highly conserved RAG1 proteins, the RAG1 core–like proteins are remarkably diverse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>During the second review of the manuscript of this article, we were kindly informed by Dr. Hervé Philippe of a RAG1 core–like sequence present the starlet sea anemone <italic>(Nematostella vectensis).</italic> After that, we screened all available Trace Archives (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and detected additional RAG1-like proteins. In starlet sea anemone, several approximately 1000-bp WGS trace sequences were found (e.g., GenBank Trace Archive IDs 668021618, 558173651, 568641192, and 599572062), which encode protein, called RAG1L_NV, that is approximately 30% identical to the human RAG1 core (positions 284–802, TBLASTN, 10<sup>−26</sup> &lt; E &lt; 10<sup>−7</sup>). We also found several approximately 1000-bp WGS trace sequences of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Hydra magnipapillata</named-content> (Trace Archive IDs 688654311, 647073738, 666995387, 687186526, 688683890, and 688948453), coding for protein sequences 26%−30% identical to the RAG1 core (positions 753−995, E-value is approximately equal to 10<sup>−7</sup> in a BLASTX search against GenBank). Using these trace sequences, we partially assembled a hydra gene, called RAG1L_NM, which encodes the RAG1 core–like protein.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the hydra RAG1L_NM protein turned out to be significantly similar to the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase (26% identity; E-value is approximately equal to 10<sup>−14</sup> in a BLASTX search against GenBank proteins combined with the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase sequences). Therefore, the hydra RAG1 core–like protein provides the first direct link between the RAG1 core and <italic>Transib</italic> TPase.</p>

        <title>N-Terminal–Like Domain of RAG1 in the Sea Urchin, Lancelet, Starlet Sea Anemone, and Hydra Genomes</title>
        <p>A separate analysis of the assembled sea urchin sequences yielded seven sequences encoding three diverse proteins that were significantly similar to the 380-aa N-terminal domain of RAG1 (BLASTX, E &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>), excluding the 100-aa N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The first 305-aa protein is encoded by contig 1226, and its recently duplicated copies are on contigs 1219 and 1222 (approximately 95% identical to each other at the protein level.) The second, 195-aa protein (contig 83099) is the shortest. It is only approximately 26% identical to the first protein and more than 90% identical at the DNA level to its duplicate on contig 86231. We also found a third protein on contig 768 that contains unique motifs in its N-terminal regions that best match the homologous regions of RAG1. Furthermore, we found that unassembled WGS trace sequences encode two other proteins, P4_SP and P5_SP, similar to the N-terminal RAG1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>By analyzing the lancelet WGS traces, we also found that the lancelet genome encodes five different proteins similar to the N-terminal domain of RAG1 (BLASTP E values in searches against all GenBank proteins were in a range of 10<sup>−14</sup>–10<sup>−7</sup>). DNA sequences coding for these proteins, P1_BF through P5_BF, were manually assembled from overlapping WGS sequences (data available upon request).</p>
        <p>The proteins detected in the sea urchin and lancelet genome share a ring finger motif as well as two novel motifs matching the N-terminal RAG1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g006">Figure 6</xref>) and remotely resembling C-x2-C zinc finger motifs. The new conserved motifs are H-x3-L-x3-C-R-x-C-G and D-x3-I-h-P-x2-F-C-x2-C, and their function remains to be determined. It is thought that the ring finger motif of RAG1 functions as a zinc-binding domain, is involved in dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b35">35</xref>], and acts as an E3 ligase in the ubiquitylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b36">36</xref>]. It also likely that the N-terminal RAG1 and RAG1-like proteins share an additional conserved motif W-x-p-h-x(3–6)-C-x2-C that resides between conserved motif 2 and the ring finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>None of the sea urchin and lancelet proteins align to the approximately 100-aa N-terminus of RAG1, which may indicate that this portion is missing from the genome or highly diverged and difficult to detect. It is also worth noting that this portion corresponds to a separate exon in some teleosts (see Discussion). The ring finger motif itself is also present in several sea urchin proteins unrelated to RAG1 but significantly similar to diverse proteins associated with immune and developmental systems as well as regulation of transcription. To test whether the reported sea urchin sequences represent a true RAG1-like match, we cut off the ring finger motif and repeated the BLASTP search against all GenBank proteins. Even without the finger, the remaining portions of the sea urchin sequences were significantly similar to the corresponding portions of RAG1. BLASTP E-values were 9×10<sup>−9</sup>, 7×10<sup>−5</sup>, and 10<sup>−3</sup> for the P5_SP, P4_SP, and 768_SP sequences, respectively; because both the low-complexity filter and composition-based statistics were applied, the corresponding E-values were estimated very conservatively. BLASTP searches of the sea urchin sequences against all GenBank proteins, excluding RAG1, detected only the ring finger domain of the sea urchin sequences. E-values of these matches were much higher than the E-values of similarities to the RAG1 proteins (SP_768: 0.04 versus 7×10<sup>−7</sup>; SP_86231: 3·10<sup>−4</sup> versus 7×10<sup>−7</sup>; SP_1226: 10<sup>−4</sup> versus 2×10<sup>−7</sup>; P4_SP: 10 versus 2×10<sup>−7</sup>; P5_SP does not have ring finger and matches RAG1 only, E-value = 9×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p>
        <p>Based on the same approach, our study found that the starlet sea anemone and hydra genomes also encode several families of the N-terminal RAG1 domain that appear to be separate from the RAG1 core–like proteins (data not shown). The only exception was the already mentioned sea anemone RAG1 core–like sequence. The approximately 90-aa N-terminus of the latter sequence is the ring finger (E &lt; 10<sup>−7</sup>, multiple BLASTP matches against known ring fingers in GenBank).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The significant similarity between the <italic>Transib</italic> TPases and RAG1 core, the common structure of the <italic>Transib</italic> TIRs and RSSs, as well as the similar size of TSDs characterizing transpositions of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons and transpositions catalyzed by RAG1 and RAG2, directly support the 25-year-old hypothesis of a transposon-related origin of the V(D)J machinery. Previously, the “RAG transposon” hypothesis was open to challenge by alternative models of convergent evolution. Because there were no known TPases similar to RAG1, it could be argued that RAG1 independently developed some TPase-like properties, rather than deriving them from a TE-encoded TPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b24">24</xref>]. These arguments can now be put to rest.</p>
      <p>As shown in this paper, the RAG1 core was derived from a <italic>Transib</italic> TPase, but given the low identity between the <italic>Transib</italic> TPase and the RAG1 core (14%–17%) it is not clear whether the ancestral transposon was a member of the group of canonical <italic>Transib</italic> transposons preserved in modern genomes of insects, hydra, and sea urchin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g001">Figure 1</xref>), or a member of an unknown group of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons that encoded a TPase that was more similar to RAG1 core than to the canonical TPase from the currently known <italic>Transib</italic> transposons. Furthermore, after its recruitment, the RAG1 core most likely went through a period of intensive transformations due to diversifying/positive selection, which further decreased its similarity to <italic>Transib</italic> TPase. Afterwards, the RAG1 genes continued to evolve at a slow and steady pace under stabilizing selection, as indicated by the observed conservation of the RAG1 core (79% identity between sharks and mammals).</p>
      <p>Some of the intermediate stages of RAG1 evolution can be inferred from analysis of the sea urchin in which RAG1-like proteins were recently observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b37">37</xref>], and from analysis of the lancelet, starlet sea anemone, and hydra genomes. Based on the presence of stop codons disrupting some of the RAG1-like sequences, it has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b37">37</xref>] that the sea urchin sequences represent remnants of transposable elements. Typically, TPase-coding autonomous DNA transposons are present in only a few complete copies per genome. At the same time, sequences homologous to their terminal portions, including specific TIRs, are usually abundant due to the proliferation of nonautonomous DNA transposons fueled by the TPase expressed by the corresponding low-copy autonomous elements. Therefore, even if only 30% of the sea urchin genome has been sequenced to date, it is expected that the regions flanking the TPase portions of potential autonomous elements should be similar to numerous nonautonomous elements. So far, we have found no evidence of such similarities. Detailed analysis of regions flanking the sea urchin RAG1-like DNA coding sequences revealed a variety of different transposable elements inserted in the proximity of the coding sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Nevertheless, based on the orientations and relative positions of these transposons, none of them appears to be associated with the RAG1-like sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We also could not identify the 5-bp TSDs and TIRs characteristic of the <italic>Transib</italic> superfamily. Still, given that only one third of the sea urchin genome is currently assembled as a set of contigs longer than several thousand nucleotides (the remaining portion is represented by short WGS sequences), we cannot rule out the possibility that the sea urchin RAG1-like proteins are remnants of an unknown branch of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons. Given that the genomes of lancelet, hydra, and starlet sea anemone are currently available only as unassembled WGS traces, the question whether the corresponding RAG1-like sequences are remnants of transposons or genes/pseudogenes must be left open.</p>
      <p>The alternative possibility is that the sea urchin RAG1 core–like sequences represent diverse genes and pseudogenes that belong to a rapidly evolving multigene family. This opens the tantalizing possibility that the RAG1 core was recruited from a <italic>Transib</italic> TPase in a common ancestor of Bilaterians and Cnidarians, and subsequently lost in nematodes, insects, and sea squirts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, given that the sea urchin, lancelet, hydra, and starlet sea anemone genomes harbor several highly divergent N-terminal–like domains, separate from the RAG1 core–like sequences and known transposable elements, it is very likely that the N-terminal–like domains of RAG1 also form a multigene family that can be traced back to a common ancestor of Deuterostomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g001">Figure 1</xref>). If so, then both N-terminal and core domains of RAG1 might have been derived from different genes present in a common ancestor of Deuterostomes. Alternatively, the N-terminal domain of RAG1 might have been derived from a separate, unknown transposon. The N-terminal domain of RAG1 has long been viewed as distinct from the core domain due to its lack of direct involvement in the V(D)J recombination reaction. In the sea urchin, lancelet, hydra, and starlet sea anemone genomes, the RAG1 core–like sequences and the N-terminal domain–like sequences do not appear to be linked to each other or to any other proteins. The only notable exception is the anemone RAG1 core–like protein sequence, which is capped by the 90-aa ring finger motif. Taken together with the fact that only the RAG1 core is significantly similar to <italic>Transib</italic> TPase, the data suggest that the vertebrate RAG1 represents a fusion of once separate proteins. This is consistent with the observation that in teleosts, (bony fish) the <italic>RAG1</italic> gene is divided into exons by either one or two introns. As a result, the RAG1 core is split into separate exons at the aa position that corresponds to position 460 in the human <italic>RAG1</italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b38">38</xref>]. The core-like sequences encoded by the sea urchin WGS sequence contigs 29068 and 12509 correspond to either the second or third RAG1 exon in teleosts (depending on the number of introns), which is remarkably consistent with the fusion model. The same model predicts that the N-terminal domain of RAG1 could also be assembled from two separate domains based on the presence of the second intron in some teleosts, splitting the N-terminal domain into the 102-aa N-terminal subdomain and the rest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b34">34</xref>]. As indicated above, this subdomain, corresponding to the first exon in the genes split by two introns, appears to be missing in the sea urchin, lancelet, hydra, and starlet sea anemone N-terminal–like proteins. It may be encoded by a separate exon that is difficult to detect given its short length and the high level of sequence divergence between these species and vertebrates, or it might have been added in vertebrates. Similarly, the RAG1 core–like protein in the sea urchin genome is shorter in its N-terminal part than the core domain in vertebrates and the corresponding <italic>Transib</italic> TPase. Again, it is unclear if this part is not present in sea urchins or simply undetectable due to its small size and the high sequence divergence.</p>
      <p>It is currently believed that both RAG1 and RAG2 proteins were originally encoded by the same transposon recruited in a common ancestor of jawed vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b16">16</xref>]. However, none of the <italic>Transib</italic> transposons identified so far encode any proteins other than the <italic>Transib</italic>/RAG TPase. Also, we could not find any RAG2-like sequences in the recently sequenced sea urchin, lancelet, hydra, and sea anemone genomes, which encode RAG1-like sequences. Autonomous DNA transposons from the <italic>MuDR</italic>, <italic>Harbinger</italic>, and <italic>En/Spm</italic> superfamilies are each known to encode a second regulatory protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b24">24</xref>], whereas some transposons from these superfamilies encode the TPase only. Therefore, it is in principle possible that an ancient vertebrate <italic>Transib</italic> that was a direct ancestor of the RAG1 core also encoded a second protein, the direct ancestor of RAG2. Nevertheless, the apparent lack of RAG2-like proteins in the sequenced portion of the sea urchin, lancelet, hydra, and sea anemone genomes, as well as in <italic>Transib</italic> transposons suggests that RAG2 was introduced in a separate event in jawless vertebrates. However, given the low 30% identity between the RAG1 and sea urchin/lancelet/sea squirt RAG1-like proteins, we cannot exclude the possibility that the ancestral RAG2 protein went through a period of strong diversification driven by positive selection, and it can no longer be identified by sequence comparisons but may still be present in invertebrates. In any case, the origin of the V(D)J recombination system in jawless vertebrates appears to be a culmination of earlier evolutionary processes rather than an isolated event associated with insertion of a single transposon. If so, detailed studies of individual components, including active <italic>Transib</italic> transposons and invertebrate proteins homologous to RAG1 elements can bring new breakthroughs in our understanding of evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of V(D)J recombination.</p>
      <p>The observed sequence similarity between the RAG1 and <italic>Transib</italic> TPase protein can help to identify aa residues in the TPase that are crucial for transposition of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons. For instance, on the basis of the TPase comparison to RAG1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">S3</xref>), we were able to identify correct positions of the last two aa residues in the DDE catalytic triad (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g002">Figure 2</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>]), missed in our previous study due to insufficient data. Interestingly, only two cysteines of the zinc finger B (ZFB) C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> motif in RAG1 (residues 695–761) involved in its binding to RAG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b31">31</xref>] are perfectly conserved in the <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (motif 7; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The remaining portion of the ZFB motif was probably lost in TPases of insect <italic>Transib</italic> transposons, which do not encode RAG2-like proteins. Notably, two ZFB cysteines are part of the conserved SxxCxxC motif, and mutations of the serine from the same motif cause severe defects in RAG1 transpositions in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b32">32</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of serine in this motif is expected to be crucial to <italic>Transib</italic> transpositions.</p>
      <p>After submission of our manuscript, additional biochemical evidence favoring evolution of V(D)J recombination from transposable elements was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b25">25</xref>]. Analogously to V(D)J recombination, transposition of the fly <italic>Hermes</italic> transposon, which belongs to the <italic>hAT</italic> superfamily, is also characterized by a double-strand break via hairpin formation on flanking DNA and 3′ OH joining to the target DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b25">25</xref>]. However, although the observed biochemical relationship between the <italic>hAT</italic> TPase and V(D)J recombination is a step forward in our understanding of transposition reaction, several arguments strongly suggest that V(D)J machinery evolved from a <italic>Transib</italic> rather than from <italic>hAT</italic> transposon. First, as we mentioned previously, there is no significant sequence identity between <italic>hAT</italic> TPases and RAG1, even if one employs a PSI-BLAST search with most relaxed parameters (i.e., E &lt; 10, no filters, no composition-based statistics). Second, although RAG1/2-mediated transpositions are characterized by 5-bp (sometimes 4-bp) TSDs, all known <italic>hAT</italic> transposons are characterized by 8-bp TSDs. Third, unlike in the case of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons, TIRs of <italic>hAT</italic> transposons are different from RSS both in terms of DNA sequence similarities and their conservation patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Fourth, <italic>hAT-</italic> and RAG1/2-mediated transpositions differ dramatically in terms of the GC content of their target sites: Unlike <italic>Transib</italic> transposons and RAG1 transpositions occurring in GC-rich DNA, <italic>hAT</italic> transposons tend to be integrated into AT-rich regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). All four arguments strongly favor evolution of V(D)J machinery from a <italic>Transib</italic> transposon. Most likely, the <italic>Transib</italic> transpositions are also characterized by hairpin intermediates formed by the ends of the donor DNA double-strand breaks, as observed during V(D)J recombination and <italic>hAT</italic> transposition.</p>

          <p>Computer-assisted identification and reconstruction of the <italic>Transib</italic> transposons was done as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b40">40–42</xref>]. DNA sequence analysis including local sequence alignments, multiple alignments, and reconstruction of the <italic>Transib</italic> consensus sequences was done using software developed at Genetic Information Research Institute (available upon request) and WU-BLASTN 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.wustl.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://blast.wustl.edu</ext-link>). To avoid background noise introduced by mutations, <italic>Transib</italic> relics, whose TPase-coding regions contained numerous stop codons and indels, were ignored unless several copies were available. (We included in the analysis incomplete relics of the <italic>Transib2–5_AA</italic> TPases represented by single DNA copies). Prediction of putative exons and introns encoded by the <italic>Transib</italic> consensus sequences was done with FGENESH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b33">33</xref>] (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.softberry.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.softberry.com</ext-link>). Multiple alignments of distantly related RAG1 and <italic>Transib</italic> TPase protein sequences were created by T-Coffee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b40">40</xref>]. Shading and minor manual refinements of the aligned sequences were done using Genedoc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b43">43</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees were produced by using MEGA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b44">44</xref>]. Some of the sea urchin sequences encoding the RAG1 N-terminal domain were assembled from traces based on the Baylor BAC-Fisher server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/BAC-Fisher" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/BAC-Fisher</ext-link><bold>/</bold> (the results of assembly were verified manually).</p>
          <p>All GenBank proteins were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/DB/fasta/nr" xlink:type="simple">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/DB/fasta/nr</ext-link> (February 2004) and were combined into a single set with the identified <italic>Transib</italic> TPases. No <italic>Transib</italic> TPases had been deposited or annotated previously in GenBank, except for two short hypothetical proteins predicted automatically during annotation of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> genome: 151-aa gi:30923617 and 123-aa gi:30923765. These proteins are apparent fragments of <italic>Transib</italic> TPases encoded by relics of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons, including <italic>Transib5_DM</italic>.</p>
          <p>A standalone 2001 version of PSI (Position-Specific Iterating)-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b45">45</xref>] was used for detection of proteins that were significantly similar to TPases encoded by <italic>Transib</italic> and other superfamilies of DNA transposons. The PSI-BLAST program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b45">45</xref>] is much more sensitive than a regular BLAST search due to the use of PSSM) PSI-BLAST first performs a standard BLASTP search of a protein query against a protein database and constructs a multiple alignment of matches exceeding a certain E-value threshold (called E<sub>i</sub> value for the inclusion of sequences into PSI-BLAST iterations). From this alignment, a PSSM is constructed. The PSSM is a weight matrix indicating the relative occurrence of each of the 20 aa at each position in the alignment. This new PSSM is used as the score matrix for a new BLAST search in a second iteration. The process is repeated for a specific number of iterations or until convergence, when no additional proteins are added on successive iterations. The use of a PSSM in place of a fixed generic substitution matrix such as BLOSUM62 results in a much more sensitive BLAST search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b45">45</xref>]. Important practical aspects of using PSI-BLAST were recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b46">46</xref>].</p>
          <p>To ensure that a conservation profile for the <italic>Transib</italic> TPases and <italic>RAG1</italic> proteins was not produced by a systematic error, we employed a procedure of “step-wise” PSI-BLAST iterations. In this procedure we studied dependence of E<sub>i</sub> values on the number of the <italic>Transib</italic> TPases combined with the GenBank proteins. The following protocol describes the procedure: (1) Use a GenBank set combined with <italic>N</italic> number of <italic>Transib</italic> TPases (in our studies, <italic>N</italic> was equal to 7, 13, and 18), (2) run PSI-BLAST against GenBank combined with TPases using each TPase as a query or seed, (3) select only <italic>Transib</italic> TPase sequences with E-values less than 10<sup>−5</sup> to define the PSSM, (4) take the best E-value (E<sub>i</sub>) obtained by PSI-BLAST for RAG1s when PSSM is constructed without RAG1, then (5) repeat these operations for different numbers (<italic>N</italic>) of TPases.</p>
          <p>Significant convergence of RAG1 and <italic>Transib</italic> TPases was observed to be independent of the particular type of substitution matrix (the same result was observed for both BLOSUM62 and PAM70 matrixes). To avoid detection of false similarities caused by simple repeats and coiled coils, the PSI-BLAST search was performed using stringent conditions with the SEG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b47">47</xref>] and COILS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b48">48</xref>] filters masking all low-complexity regions and coiled coils, respectively; composition-based statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030181-b45">45</xref>] were also employed.</p>
          <p>The probability P<sub>1</sub> that the 5′ terminus of a transposon from a particular <italic>Transib</italic> family would match by chance an RSS at its most conserved positions (positions 1−3 in the RSS heptamer, and positions 5 and 6 in the RSS nonamer) was estimated based on the following formula: P<sub>1</sub> = f<sub>C</sub> × f<sub>A</sub> × f<sub>C</sub> × f<sub>A</sub> × f<sub>A</sub>, where f<sub>C</sub> (0.2) and f<sub>A</sub> (0.3) are frequencies of C and A in a set of 38-bp 5′ termini of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons from 21 families (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030181-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The value of P<sub>1</sub> is 0.001, indicating a significant similarity between <italic>Transib</italic> TIRs and RSS. Indeed, given that these five positions conserved in RSS are conserved in all TIRs from 21 families of <italic>Transib</italic> transposons, and the average identity between these 38-bp TIRs is only 49%, the chance of randomly matching these positions in TIRs from all 21 families is extremely small.</p>
