<abstract>
<p>Bacteria switch only intermittently to motile planktonic lifestyles under favorable conditions. Under chronic nutrient deprivation, however, bacteria orchestrate a switch to stationary phase, conserving energy by altering metabolism and stopping motility. About two-thirds of bacteria use flagella to swim, but how bacteria deactivate this large molecular machine remains unclear. Here, we describe the previously unreported ejection of polar motors by γ-proteobacteria. We show that these bacteria eject their flagella at the base of the flagellar hook when nutrients are depleted, leaving a relic of a former flagellar motor in the outer membrane. Subtomogram averages of the full motor and relic reveal that this is an active process, as a plug protein appears in the relic, likely to prevent leakage across their outer membrane; furthermore, we show that ejection is triggered only under nutritional depletion and is independent of the filament as a possible mechanosensor. We show that filament ejection is a widespread phenomenon demonstrated by the appearance of relic structures in diverse γ-proteobacteria including <italic>Plesiomonas shigelloides</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic>, <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. While the molecular details remain to be determined, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism for bacteria to halt costly motility when nutrients become scarce.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>In the face of starvation, bacteria must minimize their energy use. Here, we describe our unexpected finding that some bacteria take the drastic measure of ejecting their flagella in response to nutrient deficiency. Bacteria continually assemble flagella as propellers—unrelated to eukaryotic flagella—rotated by rotary motors embedded in the cell; continual rotation and assembly can consume up to 3% of a bacterium’s energy. Using electron cryo-tomography, a technique that provides high-resolution 3D images of intact bacteria, we were surprised to find partial flagellar motors in bacterial cells that were rare when nutrients were abundant but became common when nutrients were scarce. A variety of clues led us to hypothesize that these structures were relics of motors whose flagella had been ejected, which we confirmed using a genetic approach. Curiously, flagellar relics—which would otherwise be open portals through which the contents of the bacterial periplasm could leak—were plugged by an unidentified protein, presumably as a preservation measure. We speculate that flagellar ejection saves the bacterium from the costs of continuously assembling and rotating its flagella, as a last-ditch survival attempt. Our work provides a striking example of evolution arriving at a functional yet unintuitive solution to a problem.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many bacteria switch to a nonmotile lifestyle in stationary phase to conserve energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref001">1</xref>], but how this switch is accomplished is poorly understood. The most widespread motility device used by bacteria is the flagellum, found in approximately two-thirds of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref002">2</xref>]. Bacterial flagellar filaments are helical propellers that extend several microns from the cell from a periplasm-spanning rotary motor; rotation of the filament by a transmembrane rotary motor exerts thrust that propels the bacterium forward. Motor torque is generated by harnessing ion flux across the inner membrane; this torque is first transmitted to a periplasm-spanning rod, then to a flexible extracellular hook, and finally to the filament. The rod exits the outer membrane through dedicated P- and L-rings that act as channels through the peptidoglycan layer and outer membrane, respectively. Although the flagellum is vital for migration to favorable environments, sites of biofilm formation, or sites of infection, it is counterproductive for the cell to retain a functional flagellum during nutrient depletion, and stopping motility is preferable to resource exhaustion.</p>
<p>Methods for deactivation of flagella in different environments other than nutrient depletion are diverse across those bacteria studied to date. <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> has a unidirectional flagellum that is stopped by a “molecular brake” for navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref003">3</xref>], while <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> uses a “molecular clutch” to stop flagellum rotation and swimming for biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref004">4</xref>]. The <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (“<italic>Salmonella</italic>”) and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> motors are proposed to be inactivated by a “backstop brake”, YcgR, a cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref006">6</xref>], while <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> modulates its motility via a YcgR homologue, FlgZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref007">7</xref>]. The α-proteobacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, meanwhile, actively ejects its single, polar flagellum upon surface sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref007">7</xref>] in order to build an adhesive stalk for surface adhesion.</p>
<p>Little is currently known about how the widespread polar-flagellated γ-proteobacteria modulate motility. This group includes a diverse set of pathogens occupying both sessile and planktonic niches, including human pathogens <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic>, opportunistic pathogens <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic>, and nonpathogenic members including the squid symbiont <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic>. These γ-proteobacteria have one or more polar flagella whose motors are powered by Na<sup>+</sup>-ions; these motors are both faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref008">8</xref>] and provide higher torque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref009">9</xref>] than the model peritrichous (positioned over the entire cell surface) flagellar motors from <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>; polar Na<sup>+</sup>-driven motors assemble at only one pole until division. Na<sup>+</sup>-driven polar motors have a number of structural differences to the well-studied enteric-like motors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref011">11</xref>]. Most striking in subtomogram averages is the addition of periplasmic (H-ring and T-ring) and outer membrane (basal) disks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref009">9</xref>]. The T-ring, made up of MotX and MotY, contributes to the assembly and scaffolding of the stator complexes (PomA/PomB). Many γ-proteobacteria also incorporate a sheath, an outer membrane extension that encapsulates the flagellum. The H-ring and basal disk, composed of FlgO, FlgP, and FlgT, have recently been shown to assist in outer membrane penetration in these bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref012">12</xref>], although their function is likely broader than sheath formation, given that many unsheathed bacteria also retain an H-ring.</p>
<p>Here, we describe work showing that γ-proteobacteria eject their polar Na<sup>+</sup>-driven flagella in response to nutrient depletion. The ejected flagella leave a “relic” of the ejected motor in the outer membrane composed of the P-, L-, H-, and T-rings and the basal disk. During this transition, a previously undescribed plug is incorporated into the relic. This is likely an active mechanism to block periplasmic leakage. We speculate on the nature of the novel flagellar plug and the significance of flagellar ejection. Note that this work was previously available as a preprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref013">13</xref>]; a similar preprint concluded that “relics” are instead outer-membrane assembly precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<title>γ-proteobacterial motility slows as cell density increases</title>
<p>While tracking the swimming speeds of the γ-proteobacterium <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic>, we noticed that bacteria with multiple Na<sup>+</sup>-driven polar flagella showed a significant decrease in swimming speed when grown to later growth stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Video tracking of individual bacterial cells revealed that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> swam at 40 μm s<sup>−1</sup> between optical density (OD) 0.2 and OD approximately 0.7 before swimming speeds sharply dropped at OD 0.8, down to 12 μm s<sup>−1</sup> at OD 1.0. Furthermore, the percentage of active swimmers dropped from over 95% at early growth stage up to OD 0.6 to approximately 5% by OD 1.0. Another γ-proteobacterium, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic>, displayed the same characteristic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Strikingly, however, the model enteric bacterium <italic>Salmonella</italic> that uses a different family of flagellar motors continued swimming as well as, if not faster than, <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells at OD 0.2 when cultured to higher cell densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Decreased swimming speed is due to loss of flagella</title>
<p>In the course of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref009">9</xref>], we noted that flagellation levels in γ-proteobacteria are highest early in their growth stage (low cell density). To determine whether the decrease in swimming speed of γ-proteobacteria was due to differences in flagellation levels at different growth stages, flagella were counted in negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) images of cells to assess flagellation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Time courses of both <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic> cells grown for longer periods of time (at increasing cell densities) showed decreasing numbers of flagella per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), and cells grown overnight into late stationary phase had no flagella. <italic>Salmonella</italic>, in contrast, had increasing or stable numbers of flagella at later growth stages (higher cell densities).</p>
<p>We sought to distinguish whether solely flagellar synthesis is down-regulated or whether flagella are also actively disassembled in γ-proteobacteria at high cell densities. Plotting the absolute number of flagella in the entire population indicated that flagella are indeed lost. The number of cells in a population was determined by calculating colony-forming units (CFUs) and relating this to the mean number of flagella per cell as counted by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The absolute number of flagella in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic> populations declined over time, demonstrating that bacteria are losing flagella faster than they are synthesizing them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The <italic>Salmonella</italic> positive control, in contrast, showed an increase in the absolute number of flagella in the population in direct correlation with CFU count, as assembly continued and no ejection occurred in later growth stages (at higher cell densities).</p>

<title>Used γ-proteobacterial growth medium contains free flagella with hooks at one end</title>
<p>To test our speculation that flagella are ejected, we determined whether supernatant of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> cells grown to stationary phase contains released flagella. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation revealed that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> growth medium indeed contained free flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Curiously, 50% of all flagellar ends had an attached hook. Given that a flagellum only has a hook attached at one of its ends, we conclude that, effectively, all isolated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> flagella have attached hooks, similar to ejected flagella from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref015">15</xref>]. Flagellar filaments were also recovered from the supernatant of a <italic>Salmonella</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Strikingly, however, no hooks were observed on any of the 70 randomly imaged <italic>Salmonella</italic> filament ends. This suggests random instead of determinate sites of filament breakage in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. As the number of flagella on <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells increases or remains stable at high density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), the broken flagellar filaments must regrow, which is in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref017">17</xref>].</p>

<title>Shed hook–filament structures accumulate in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> supernatant</title>
<p>To verify that <italic>Salmonella</italic> filaments are sheared midfilament, whereas <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> filaments are cleaved at the base of the hook, flagella were recovered from cell cultures and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells grown to high OD were removed by pelleting, and flagella were recovered from the remaining supernatant by PEG precipitation before SDS-PAGE analysis. Similar samples were collected from <italic>Salmonella</italic> cultures and volumes adjusted to match <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> cell count. The <italic>Plesiomonas</italic> supernatant had significant bands at molecular weights corresponding to both the polar flagellin (FliC) and hook (FlgE), as well as a faint band at the expected size of the distal rod (FlgG). The <italic>Salmonella</italic> supernatant contained a weaker flagellin band but lacked bands at the molecular weights corresponding to the <italic>Salmonella</italic> hook (FlgE) or rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). This confirms that <italic>Plesiomonas</italic> cells consistently lose their flagella at the base of the hook, while <italic>Salmonella</italic> flagella accumulation in the supernatant is due to shearing midfilament. We conclude that this consistent behavior in response to a specific environment, i.e., late growth stage and high cell densities, is best explained by an ejection mechanism.</p>

<title>Partial relics of flagella remain at the cell pole at high OD</title>
<p>The hypothesis that γ-proteobacteria eject their flagella led us to speculate that a partial flagellar motor structure would remain after ejection of the filament and hook. Cryo-electron tomograms were collected of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> cells grown to either early or late growth stages (low or high cell density). Consistent with our hypothesis, partial flagellar structures were seen to remain at the pole of cells grown to high OD, with fewer in cells grown to low OD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, left column). In all cases, partial flagellar structures were only observed at the flagellated cell pole. Our swimming speed and flagellar ejection results led us to speculate that these structures are the “relics” of once fully-functioning flagella that were subsequently ejected in late-growth stage (high OD) cultures, leaving only the outer-membrane rings (the P-, L-, H-, and T-rings and the basal disk) assembled. The P- and L-rings, which are integral parts of the relic structure, require a rod and chaperone for assembly; the P- and L-rings are incapable of assembling in the absence of an assembled rod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref018">18</xref>], further consistent with these structures being relics of previously full flagella.</p>

<p>The two data sets demonstrated that at high OD, relics are enriched while flagella are depleted, correlating with our observations of flagellar ejection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000165.t001">Table 1</xref>). In cells imaged at OD 0.25, flagella were predominant: 43% of cell poles had exclusively intact flagella, 48% had both intact flagella and relics, and 9% had no structures; the average number of intact flagella per pole was 5.5; if the cells had relics, the average number of relics was 2. In cells imaged at OD 1.0, relics were predominant: none of the cells had intact flagella alone; 36% had both relics and intact flagella, 12% had exclusively relics, and 52% had neither relics nor flagella; and in contrast to cells grown to low OD, if the cells had intact flagella, the average seen was 1.3, while the average number of relics was 3.3. Note that because relics are harder to detect in the cryo-tomograms since they are relatively small and lack a flagellum, we may not have identified all relics that were present in the imaged cells. Consistent with this, imaging lysed cells grown to OD 1 revealed substantially more relics than we could detect in intact cells (up to 20 at a pole) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000165.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This data set was not used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000165.t001">Table 1</xref>, however, as we cannot deconvolute any effect of cell lysis on relic appearance. Nevertheless, this result confirms that many relics accumulate at the cell pole. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000165.t001">Table 1</xref> link OD to presence of the relic structures and demonstrate that not only are flagella being ejected, but assembly is also halted, as many cells harvested at high OD have neither flagella nor relics, indicating newly formed poles that have not yet assembled a single flagellum.</p>

<title>Diverse γ-proteobacteria retain relics of ejected flagella</title>
<p>In order to determine whether this pattern is widespread amongst the γ-proteobacteria beyond <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic>, we collected cryo-tomograms from four additional γ-proteobacterial species: <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic>, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, right four columns). Markedly, in all species, we observed similar relic structures in the outer membrane of the cell poles, alongside intact flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This was particularly unexpected in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic>, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, given that they only ever assemble one flagellar motor at the pole. Indeed, in one tomogram, we observed four relics alongside a single intact flagellum in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>.</p>
<p>Relics from sheathed and unsheathed γ-proteobacteria had different outer-membrane morphologies. Relics from tomograms of sheathed <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic> were capped by a continuous sealed outer membrane. Ejection of the flagellum in these bacteria must include shearing of the sheath from the outer membrane and subsequent closure of the torn membrane.

<title>A novel protein plug in flagellar relics suggests a method for preventing periplasmic leakage</title>
<p>To better understand the relationship of relics to intact motors, we determined the structures of both by subtomogram averaging of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Clear 13-fold symmetry was observed in the stator complexes and MotXY ring of the full motor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000165.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref011">11</xref>]. The relic structure resembled the outer-membrane flagellar structure, although it lacked bound stator complexes, suggesting that the relic is composed of the same proteins as the outer membrane–associated structures from the flagellar motor. In both structures, the distance between the MotXY ring (T-ring) and the outer membrane was 19 nm, and the diameter of the MotXY ring was 44 nm. In the motor, the diameter of the rod exit hole in the outer membrane was 15 nm, which is the same as in the relic outer membrane that is held open by the L-ring, despite lack of the rod. To confirm that relic structures really are remnants of old flagellar motors, we sought to confirm that they are composed of the same proteins as the outer-membrane portion of the flagellar motor. We purified a His<sub>6</sub>- and mCherry tagged version of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic> MotX, the outermost protein from the T-ring, from membranes by affinity purification. Negative-stain EM and 2D classification of our affinity-purified, MotX-containing particles revealed homogenous top-views. These were comprised of a series of concentric rings, filled in the middle, consistent with top-views of relic subtomogram averages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000165.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The sizes of the rings matched the basal disk (50 nm), T-ring (37 nm), and MotY-ring (29 nm) of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic>. Based on these observations, we conclude that relics are composed of flagellar outer-membrane proteins yet lack flagellar inner membrane, rod, and hook components.</p>
<p>Notably, an extra density in the relic structure plugged the P-ring aperture in the position that was previously occupied by the trans-periplasmic rod. Comparison of the flagellar and relic subtomogram averages confirmed that this density was unambiguously an additional protein absent from intact flagellar motors: while the rod was absent from the relics, the additional relic density observed did not correspond to loss of density elsewhere in the relic, which would result from a conformational change in a previously assembled component protein. Furthermore, this plug appeared to be an obligate part of the relic, as no relics were observed without a plug upon detachment of the axial structure—made of part of the rod, the hook, and filament—from the relic structure. The relics from both sheathed and unsheathed bacteria contained the plug protein regardless of the sealing of the outer membrane in the sheathed flagella. Bioinformatic predictions of potential novel flagellar components based on operon co-occurrence and phylogenetic profiling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref019">19</xref>], however, failed to identify suitable candidates, and we were unable to refine relic purification sufficiently for mass spectrometry analysis. We conclude that the plug is an as-yet unidentified protein that plugs the P-ring aperture concomitantly with flagellar ejection to prevent periplasmic leakage.</p>

<title>Verification that the outer-membrane structure is a flagellar relic and not an assembly precursor</title>
<p>We sought to verify whether our so-called relic partial flagellar structures were indeed flagellar relics and not flagellar assembly precursors by testing the prediction that relics would require prior assembly of the rod while assembly precursors would not. To abolish rod assembly, we developed an <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic> Δ<italic>flhA</italic> mutant incapable of assembling the rod due to disruption of the intrinsic flagellar type III secretion system.

<p>Further confirming that flagellar partial structures are relics, we observed flagellar ejection “caught in the act” in one tomogram of wild-type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic>, with a filament, hook, and rod structure adjacent to a flagellar partial structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The ejected filament retained both the hook and distal rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), which correspond to the only structures missing from the motor; notably, the P-ring of the partial structure was already plugged with a plug protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>An orthogonal test for whether partial structures were relics or assembly intermediates was to inspect for anticipated interactions with the inner membrane because partial structures and intact flagella colocalize to the pole, suggesting a common localization mechanism. In the case of assembly intermediates, localization would likely be mediated via linkage to the inner membrane; in the case of relics, flagellar placement would have preceded ejection, and no connection to the inner membrane would be required. To test this, the distance between the inner- and outer-membrane disk was measured in fully formed motors as well as in partial structures. Periplasmic distances varied in both cases, as expected from previous work in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>alginolyticus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref020">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, variation in membrane distance at the position of partial structures was far greater than at the intact flagella (13.9 nm and 7.9 nm range, respectively), suggesting that partial structures do not contain a connection with the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>These results, combined with the mixture of relic, rod, and hook genes interspersed throughout the same operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), lead us to conclude that these structures are indeed relics of ejected flagellar motors made of an outer-membrane subset of flagellar proteins and not flagellar assembly intermediates.</p>

<title>Motor and relic placement are not random and follow the same placement pattern</title>
<p>We observed that intact flagella and relics appear spaced on a grid at cell poles, suggesting that placement is not random and that both structures share a common grid. The nearest neighbor distances for all intact flagella and relics were determined and found to be on average 64 nm, approximately 20 nm greater than would be expected if distances were constrained by steric clashes of approximately 45-nm diameter C-rings. To assess whether the placement of both relics and intact flagella is the same, which would suggest a common mechanism for placement, histograms were plotted for all distances to nearest neighbors of relics, intact flagella, and random data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<p>To quantify the dispersal of intact flagella and relic structures independent of the number of structures per cell, Clark–Evans distribution analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref021">21</xref>] was calculated for each cell pole with more than four intact flagella or relics (<italic>N</italic> = 71) and compared to a synthesized random data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Values between 1 and 2.15 suggest a uniform grid, while values below 1 suggest clustering. A value close to 1 is a random dispersion. The approximately 500 synthesized random poles (constrained by the same number of structures and pole area as the real data) had a mean of 1, as expected. The <italic>Plesiomonas</italic> data set, however, had a mean close to 2. This shows that structures at the pole are placed in a nonrandom distribution in a grid-like arrangement and that the relics and intact flagella are part of the same grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

<title>Ejection is triggered by the depletion of nutrients, not chemical or mechanical signals</title>
<p>Our initial results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1</xref>) indicated that an aspect of culture growth conditions triggers flagellar ejection. What, though, was the specific trigger? One possibility is that high cell density is physically detected by tangling of filaments. To test whether the trigger is mediated by mechanosensitivity of the load on the flagellar filament, a mutant lacking the polar flagellin FliC was made in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> and imaged with ECT. Both motors with hooks as well as relics were observed in these cells, confirming that ejection does not require the flagellar filament (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000165.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This implies that mechanosensation of load on the motor by the filament is not the trigger for ejection. Furthermore, this observation is incompatible with mechanical shearing driving relic formation, as a short hook will be protected from shearing by the Reynolds shell around the bacterium, and unlikely to drive loss of the short hook.</p>
<p>To distinguish between cell density or nutrient depletion as the trigger for ejection, we tested whether cells continually diluted with fresh lysogeny broth (LB) retained their flagella. We compared the number of flagella on cells grown to an OD of 1 with that of cells grown over the same time period but continually diluted with fresh medium to maintain an optical density below 0.2. Undiluted bacteria had a mean of 1.7 flagella, while continually diluted bacteria had a mean of 5.3 flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), suggesting that the signal for ejection is intrinsic to the medium of old cells, not cell density.</p>

<p>To further confirm this, early growth–stage (low OD) cells were moved into spent medium and grown for one doubling time from OD 0.2 to 0.4 (doubling time in fresh LB = 19 minutes and in spent medium = 38 minutes). Within a single cell cycle, multiple flagella were lost, with mean number of flagella dropping from 6.7 to 1.2. A control culture grown in fresh LB and negatively stained at the same optical densities retained all flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This result suggests that the trigger for flagellar ejection is in the supernatant of cells that have lost flagella.</p>
<p>To distinguish whether the signal in the supernatant is a species-specific chemical secreted by late growth–stage cells (high OD), or depletion of a medium component, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> cells were grown to low OD and transferred to spent supernatant from <italic>Salmonella</italic> grown to stationary phase. As with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> spent medium, within one cell division in <italic>Salmonella</italic> spent medium, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> cells lost multiple flagella (mean number of flagella went from 6.2 to 1.6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), suggesting that the signal is depletion, not presence of a signaling molecule. To confirm this, we moved early growth–stage (low OD) cells from LB into MOPS minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Cells stopped swimming within an hour, and within one doubling time, the cells had lost most of their flagella as counted by negative-stain electron microscopy, with a drop in mean number of flagella from 5.8 to 1.6. We further confirmed that the ejection of flagella can be rescued by adding yeast extract to the minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Together, these results confirm that lack of nutrients is a necessary and sufficient signal for ejection of flagella and entry into a nonmotile state.</p>
<p>These results are best compatible with an active ejection mechanism. To further test whether ejection is active, we distinguished between passive random filament breakage and determinate ejection at the base of the hook. We grew cells to low OD in LB before washing and resuspending them into either fresh LB or MOPS minimal medium and left them to grow for one doubling time. Supernatant from both cultures was PEG precipitated and run on an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Not only was the amount of shed flagellin (FliC) in supernatant from cells grown in minimal medium substantially greater than those grown in fresh LB, but also, supernatant from cells moved into fresh LB had no hook protein, whereas the supernatant from cells moved into minimal medium had substantial amounts of hook protein. The flagellin from the fresh LB sample may therefore result from a small amount of random filament breakage, while minimal medium triggers a distinct ejection of flagellar filaments and hooks from the base of the hook. This confirms the substantially increased rate of flagellar ejection under nutrient depletion conditions and further supports an active ejection mechanism, as opposed to passive breakage.</p>
<p>In many bacteria, the transition from motile to sessile states is mediated by concentration changes of the intracellular second messenger c-di-GMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref023">23</xref>]. To determine whether flagellar ejection is mediated by c-di-GMP signaling, we overexpressed the c-di-GMP-synthesizing diguanylate-cyclase VdcA from <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> cells and monitored motility and flagellar number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). As expected, motility was abolished in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> cells overexpressing VdcA but not in wild-type (WT) cells harboring an empty vector and grown under the same conditions. Surprisingly, however, when we counted flagella on cells induced to overexpress VdcA, we saw no decrease in number of flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). This result demonstrates that flagellar ejection in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic> is not under c-di-GMP control.</p>
<p>We attempted to identify the molecular mechanism underlying flagellar release and ejection. We used transposon insertions to screen for mutants incapable of detecting nutrient depletion, reasoning that these would retain motility at high cell densities, and set up suppressor screens on motility plates made from minimal medium or spent medium to identify motility flares but identified no candidates (results not shown). We speculate that the trigger mechanism is redundant, requiring simultaneous mutation of multiple targets. We also tested the effect of uncoupling the proton gradient across the inner membrane using CCCP; although motility was lost, flagella were not ejected. Based on the analogy of ClpA-mediated flagellar ejection by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref024">24</xref>], we tested whether ClpA or ClpX were responsible for flagellar ejection. Flagellar ejection rates were not reduced, however, in either <italic>clpA</italic> or <italic>clpX</italic> deletion mutants. The molecular mechanism of flagellar ejection, therefore, remains unclear.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we describe a new mechanism of switching from motile to nonmotile states in the polarly flagellated γ-proteobacteria. To achieve this, we used electron microscopy to analyze the structural changes in species that showed characteristic decreases in swimming speeds when grown to high cell density. We found that these bacteria respond to nutrient depletion by shifting from motile to nonmotile state by ejecting their flagellar hook, distal rod, and filament into the supernatant and found the rate of loss is increased upon nutrient depletion and cannot be attributed to mechanical or arbitrary mechanisms. Using ECT, we showed that the relics of these ejected flagella are retained by the cell and remain at old cell poles. Subtomogram averaging revealed that relics were plugged by a novel protein complex that likely functions to prevent periplasmic leakage. We further showed that plugged relics are found in all of the polarly flagellated γ-proteobacterial species imaged to date: <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic>, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic>, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>Our results, together with previous data, show that the outer-membrane partial flagellar structures are relics and not assembly intermediates awaiting insertion of a rod, hook, and filament. γ-proteobacterial polar flagella loss correlates with recovery of flagella with hooks from the supernatant; a decrease in swimming speed, flagella per cell, and flagella in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g001">Fig 1</xref>); and appearance of more relic structures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.3000165.t001">Table 1</xref>). Appearance of multiple relics at a single pole of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, a bacterium that only ever assembles exactly one polar flagellum, is incompatible with controlled assembly of a single polar flagellum regulated in the initial stages of flagellar formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref025">25</xref>] but consistent with relics arising from multiple rounds of flagellar synthesis and ejection. Furthermore, P- and L-rings, which form the core of the relics, require a distal rod for assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref018">18</xref>] and multiple P-rings assemble around polyrods, showing that the rod, and not the outer membrane, triggers P-/L-ring formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref027">27</xref>], arguing that the P- and L-ring relic core cannot assemble without the rod. Indeed, recent work in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>alginolyticus</italic>, a close relative of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic> and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, suggests that the H-ring is prerequisite in outer-membrane penetration in bacteria with sheathed flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref012">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the selective assembly of relic components FlgH, FlgI, FlgO, FlgP, FlgT, MotX, and MotY is incompatible with the structure of their operon, in which they are interspersed with flagellar rod and hook genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). (Although we cannot rule out the different mechanisms of secretion—i.e., Sec and the flagellar type III secretion system—segregating relic structures from axial structures actively during assembly, such an operon structure would likely face considerable selective pressure to fragment into separate modules representing discrete, independent structural components; operon structure is well-known as a hallmark of structural coassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref029">29</xref>].) Also, the range in periplasmic distance at relics is far greater than at full motors, suggesting no link between the relics and the inner membrane, and motors and relics are positioned on a common grid, suggesting a common assembly mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g004">Fig 4</xref>), likely from the cytoplasm, despite absence of attachment to the inner membrane. Finally, in a T3S-deficient strain (Δ<italic>flhA</italic>), no relic structures were seen, a final confirmation that these structures cannot be assembly intermediates (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000165.s004">S4</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Use of a plug protein indicates a specific cellular response</title>
<p>A striking feature of relics is the addition of a “plug” that is filling the space usually occupied by the distal rod. A targeted response to the ejection of the flagellum in the form of a plug is significant, as this plug may prevent leakage of cellular components. Plug placement is likely rapid, as a tomogram of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>putrefaciens</italic> caught immediately after ejection has a partial motor that already contains the plug protein, and we observed no relics without a plug in any of the organisms. The plug density in the relic subtomogram average is large, and no density in the subtomogram average of the full motor can account for this (if it were a gate mechanism as seen in the injectisome secretin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref030">30</xref>]). We therefore believe that this is a unique protein not already in the flagellar motor and not secreted via the flagellar type III secretion system.</p>
<p>We were able to partially purify relics but were unsuccessful in identifying the plug protein using mass spectrometry approaches, likely due to low copy number of relics. Although it is possible that we were unsuccessful identifying the plug because it is a known flagellar protein that has undergone a conformational change to become the plug, analysis of subtomogram averages argues against this possibility, as all other densities remain intact and retain their conformations. Another possibility is that the plug is a flagellar protein that does not form part of the motor. Possible candidates include one of the rod proteins, the rod cap FlgJ, or the P-ring assembly factor FlgA. While we cannot rule out these possibilities, such a conformational change would be unprecedented, and we favor the speculation that the plug is composed of a yet-to-be-discovered enigmatic protein.</p>
<p>The alternative strategy to prevent periplasmic leakage would be disassembly of the entire relic structure and resealing of the outer membrane, requiring evolution of an intricate machinery for proteolysis of all components. Evolution is a tinkerer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref031">31</xref>], and plugging the hole is a considerably more trivial solution than orchestrated disassembly, particularly given that retaining plugged relic structures is unlikely to be detrimental to the cell.</p>
<p>We speculate that in the relatively well-studied case of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic>, flagellar ejection of a similar plugging mechanism may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref032">32</xref>]. Although an active mechanism for rearrangement of the outer membrane after flagellar ejection is likely to exist to prevent leakage of periplasmic components out of the cell, at present it is unclear what this might be and what the fate of the outer-membrane components is after ejection. The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic> flagellar motor, however, does not contain large outer-membrane disks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref002">2</xref>], so the visualization of a <italic>Caulobacter</italic> relic, made up of only the P and L-rings, would prove difficult with ECT.</p>

<title>Mechanism of flagellar ejection</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that flagellar ejection is active and triggered by nutrient depletion. Increased rate of flagellar loss during nutrient depletion, determinate ejection at the base of the hook only under nutrient depletion, ejection even of hooks regardless of presence of the filament, and presence of a plug combine to argue against passive, arbitrary flagellar loss. Indeed, we routinely monitor γ-proteobacterial motility in more viscous media, yet do not observe abolished swimming motility due to viscosity changes, as seen in a <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliF mutant that readily loses its distal rod, hook, and filament when swarming or in higher viscosity medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<title>The selective benefit of flagellar ejection</title>
<p>The γ-proteobacteria with Na<sup>+</sup>-driven motors eject their flagella and enter a nonmotile state, unlike <italic>Salmonella</italic>. As ejection occurs in nutrient limited environments, this may be a mechanism for bacterial cultures to conserve energy by cutting back on their more extravagant energy expenditures such as flagellar motility.</p>
<p>Why polarly flagellated γ-proteobacteria eject filaments under nutrient depletion, whereas <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> simply cease assembly (leading to a decrease in flagellar number over time due to dilution), is unclear. The difference may be due to differences in placement of flagella: being peritrichous, <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> lose flagella by dilution as the cell elongates. With the polar flagellates, motors are polar and therefore not diluted as the cell elongates. Rather, one daughter cell inherits an entire set of flagella. Ejection, therefore, is a drastic but potentially necessary survival mechanism for those daughter cells that inherit the burden of old, undiluted, fully-flagellated poles. <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic> has previously been shown to lose flagella upon colonization of the squid light cavity and regrow them when exposed to fresh seawater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref036">36</xref>], although how this observation generalizes over other γ-proteobacteria is unclear. Flagellation levels have been shown to decrease as bacteria enter stationary phase. We suggest that flagellar ejection is a mechanism to reduce the number of flagella on a cell pole. Not only do active flagella require energy for torque generation, but flagellar assembly is a constant process and a constant drain on cell energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref037">37</xref>]. Though drastic, decreasing the number of flagella by ejection would be an effective energy conservation measure. Furthermore, this mechanism may be specific for polar flagella: there is no evidence that lateral flagella, assembled by species including <italic>P</italic>. <italic>shigelloides</italic>, are ejected; such flagella will be diluted as with the peritrichous flagella of <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. It is also noteworthy that loss of flagella will inevitably reduce the Reynolds shell around the bacterium, effectively making the bacterium smaller, although the selective benefit of this is unclear.</p>

<title>Model for assembly and ejection of the Na<sup>+</sup>-driven polar flagellum</title>
<p>Our results enable interpretation of the multiple states of the flagellum caught in tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We propose a model for the steps of assembly and ejection of the polar γ-proteobacterial flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000165.g006">Fig 6</xref>). After assembly of the MS-ring, C-ring, and flagellar type III secretion system, the rod is assembled. Recent work in <italic>Salmonella</italic> showed that polymerization of the rod is stopped by hitting the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000165.ref038">38</xref>]. In subtomograms of this stage, the rod appears to hit the outer membrane perpendicular and push on it, forming a bulge in the outer membrane. We believe that the same mechanism for stopping rod polymerization in the enteric motors is found in polar flagellar motors. Once the P- and L- rings form around the rod, FlgO, FlgP, FlgT, MotX, and MotY can assemble on this platform, and the hook and filament can be assembled through the channel in the outer membrane formed by the L-ring. Upon nutrient depletion, however, the filament, hook, and distal rod are released and a plug protein fills in the leftover gap. The inner-membrane and C-ring components are finally cleared away. The ejection of flagella in nutrient depleted environments and subsequent rebuilding when exposed to fresh nutrients is a novel mechanism for the transition between a planktonic and a sessile state shown here to be widespread amongst the Na<sup>+</sup>-driven polar flagellated γ-proteobacteria.</p>
