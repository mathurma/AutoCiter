<abstract>
<p>Cyclic nucleotide signalling is a major regulator of malaria parasite differentiation. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes are known to control cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels in the parasite, but the mechanisms by which cyclic AMP (cAMP) is regulated remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> phosphodiesterase β (PDEβ) hydrolyses both cAMP and cGMP and is essential for blood stage viability. Conditional gene disruption causes a profound reduction in invasion of erythrocytes and rapid death of those merozoites that invade. We show that this dual phenotype results from elevated cAMP levels and hyperactivation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Phosphoproteomic analysis of PDEβ-null parasites reveals a &gt;2-fold increase in phosphorylation at over 200 phosphosites, more than half of which conform to a PKA substrate consensus sequence. We conclude that PDEβ plays a critical role in governing correct temporal activation of PKA required for erythrocyte invasion, whilst suppressing untimely PKA activation during early intra-erythrocytic development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cyclic nucleotide signalling pathways are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and regulate a plethora of cellular processes. Pathway components include cyclases and phosphodiesterases that synthesise and break down the intracellular second messengers cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP); the signal is translated into a cellular response by effector kinases activated by elevated cyclic nucleotide levels. Malaria parasites deploy cyclic nucleotide signalling to regulate virtually every stage of their complex life cycle. Using a conditional gene knockout approach, we investigate the function of phosphodiesterase β (PDEβ) in the disease-causing blood stage parasites. PDEβ disruption causes a severe reduction in erythrocyte invasion and rapid post-invasion death. Although we show that PDEβ can hydrolyse cAMP and cGMP, both parts of the phenotype are linked to elevated cAMP levels and hyperactivation of PKA. Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis identified sites that are differentially phosphorylated in the PDEβ knockout, revealing a role for cAMP signalling in cellular processes ranging from chromatin organisation to protein synthesis, as well as the regulation of parasite-specific components of the erythrocyte invasion machinery. In summary, PDEβ disruption causes a profound dysregulation of key events during blood stage replication that could be exploited for the development of new antimalarial drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The malaria parasite life cycle comprises extended phases in both a human host and a mosquito vector, but little is known of the control mechanisms that orchestrate progression of parasite development and transmission. Asexually replicating blood stage forms cause all the symptoms and pathology associated with malaria, whereas sexual stage parasites called gametocytes are required to mediate transmission to mosquitoes. Cyclic nucleotide signalling is important at most of the key stages of the parasite life cycle in both the host and vector. A role for cyclic GMP (cGMP)–dependent protein kinase (PKG) has been demonstrated in blood stage egress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref002">2</xref>] and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref003">3</xref>], gametogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref004">4</xref>], ookinete motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref006">6</xref>], and sporozoite motility required for invasion of mosquito vector salivary glands and host hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref009">9</xref>]. Available evidence suggests a role for cyclic AMP (cAMP)–dependent protein kinase (PKA) in blood stage invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref012">12</xref>], cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref014">14</xref>], anion conductance, and gametocyte deformability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref016">16</xref>] as well as regulated exocytosis of sporozoite apical organelles and hepatocyte infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref017">17</xref>]. Two recent studies on cAMP signalling in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> have shown that absence of one of the three PKA catalytic subunits (PKAc1) leads to premature egress of tachyzoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref019">19</xref>]. These studies also revealed roles for PKAc1 in cross talk with cGMP signalling at this stage of the life cycle. An earlier study established a role for PKAc3 in negative regulation of bradyzoite differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref020">20</xref>]. Additional key players in cyclic nucleotide signalling are purine nucleotide cyclases, which synthesise cAMP and cGMP from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), respectively, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which break down these messenger molecules by hydrolysis. Cyclic nucleotide levels in the cell are balanced by the opposing action of these two enzyme classes and, upon reaching a concentration threshold, activate their respective cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, PKA and PKG.</p>
<p>The <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genome encodes four PDEs (PlasmoDB identifiers: PDEα, PF3D7_1209500; PDEβ, PF3D7_1321500; PDEγ, PF3D7_1321600; and PDEδ, PF3D7_1470500). Reverse genetic approaches have demonstrated that PDEα, PDEγ, and PDEδ are all associated with cGMP hydrolysis but are not essential for blood stage replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref023">23</xref>]. In contrast, previous attempts to delete <italic>PDEβ</italic> in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> were unsuccessful, suggesting that the enzyme might be essential for asexual blood stage development. Consistent with this, the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> PlasmoGEM global gene knockout project and a recent <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> global transposon mutagenesis project defined <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei PDEβ</italic> (<italic>PbPDEβ</italic>,PBANKA_141980) and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum PDEβ</italic> (<italic>PfPDEβ</italic>) as likely essential based on an extremely low relative growth rate of gene knockout parasites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plasmogem.sanger.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">http://plasmogem.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref024">24</xref>] and the absence of transposon insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref025">25</xref>], respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that PDEβ is the only essential PDE in the clinically relevant asexual blood stages of the parasite life cycle. Attempts to express recombinant PDEβ have also been unsuccessful. As a result, its substrate specificity and molecular function in the parasite are unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we have used a conditional genetic approach to investigate the essentiality and role of PDEβ in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> blood stage development. This has revealed a critical role in blood stage growth that is likely the result of dysregulated PKA activity.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>PfPDEβ is a dual-specific PDE that translocates from a likely apical location to a peripheral membrane of merozoites</title>
<p>PfPDEβ is expressed during asexual blood stage development with mRNA levels increasing in the second half of the approximately 48-hour cycle and peaking in mature schizonts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plasmodb.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://plasmodb.org/</ext-link>). The presence of six putative transmembrane domains distinguishes PfPDEβ from all but one (hPDE3) of the 11 human PDE families that are otherwise soluble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref026">26</xref>]. It is currently not possible to predict the substrate specificity of a PDE from its sequence, as this is thought to be defined by multiple components of the binding pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref027">27</xref>], but sequence comparisons of the catalytic domain of PfPDEβ with selected mammalian PDEs show that 14 of the 15 residues that are invariant amongst all human PDEs are conserved in PfPDEβ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This suggests that it is a bona fide enzymatically active PDE.</p>
<p>Using a transgenic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> line in which PfPDEβ was tagged with a triple haemagglutinin (3×HA) tag (PfPDEβ<sub>HA</sub>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), expression was detectable by immunofluorescence (IFA) throughout blood stage development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). In a western blot time course, a band at around the expected size of the tagged protein (about 136 kDa) was most intense at the late schizont stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Full-length PfPDEβ protein was also detected in early and late ring stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). Further IFA experiments showed that in early schizonts, PDEβ colocalises with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident protein plasmepsin V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We then used the PKG inhibitor Compound 2 and the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 in parallel to examine the localisation by IFA of PDEβ at two stages of late schizont development. Compound 2 blocks development of fully segmented schizonts with all the surrounding membranes intact. E64 blocks schizont development at a slightly later stage when the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) has ruptured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This approach revealed a dual localisation for PDEβ consistent with a distinct apical signal predominant in Compound 2–arrested schizonts and a pattern reminiscent of a plasma membrane or inner membrane complex (IMC) localisation in E64-arrested schizonts and in free merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Both localisation patterns were also observed in unblocked schizonts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). These data, combined with the prediction that PDEβ is an integral membrane protein, suggest that the PDEβ is transported via the ER to an apical location (presumably a secretory apical organelle) and then subsequently discharged to the plasma membrane of individual merozoites within mature schizonts.</p>

To establish whether PDEβ is capable of hydrolysing cAMP, we immunoprecipitated the protein from PfPDEβ<sub>HA</sub> schizont extracts via its epitope tag, followed by a PDE activity assay. This clearly demonstrates that PDEβ is a dual-specific PDE that is able to hydrolyse both cAMP and cGMP in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).

Merozoites emerging from individual RAP- and mock-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts were followed by video microscopy to assess their competence to induce red cell deformation, echinocytosis, and to conclude successful invasion. Rupture events from RAP-treated schizonts showed a highly significant reduction in all three steps, suggesting that invasion by PDEβ-null merozoites is impaired upstream of tight junction formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s009">S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s013">S7</xref> Videos; the first two are wild type and the last three are knockout). The subpopulation (29%) of PfPDEβ-null parasites that were able to invade consistently gave rise to small, apparently intracellular, merozoite-sized parasites with little or no development of a vacuole or cytoplasm, suggesting a block in development immediately following invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Analysis of the morphology of these dysmorphic intracellular parasites over time revealed that pyknotic parasites were present from the first hour after invasion, whilst some parasites that initially developed a vacuole appeared to rapidly shrink to condensed, dysmorphic forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s006">S6A Fig</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that disruption of PDEβ function leads to approximately a 70% reduction in merozoite invasion and that in the subpopulation of merozoites that successfully invade an erythrocyte, subsequent early post-invasion development is prevented, leading to parasite death prior to ring stage formation.</p>

<title>PDEβ disruption leads to a dramatic reduction in schizont cAMP and cGMP hydrolytic activity and elevated cellular cAMP levels</title>
<p>To evaluate the impact of PfPDEβ ablation on overall PDE activity in the parasite, schizont extracts were assayed for levels of cAMP and cGMP hydrolytic activity. Cyclic AMP-PDE activity was reduced by approximately 11-fold in extracts of the PfPDEβ-null parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), with the small amount of residual cAMP-PDE activity likely being attributed to parasites in which gene excision had not taken place. In contrast, cGMP-PDE activity was reduced by only approximately 3.5-fold, with significant residual activity. These results confirmed that <italic>PfPDEβ</italic> disruption leads to ablation of enzyme activity, and importantly were also consistent with the analysis of immunoprecipitated PDEβ-HA described above in showing that PDEβ is a dual-specific PDE enzyme capable of hydrolysing both cAMP and cGMP. The results also confirmed that there is at least one other PDE expressed in schizonts possessing cGMP-PDE activity, probably PDEα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref022">22</xref>]. The results strongly suggest that there is no other asexual blood stage PDE capable of hydrolysing cAMP. In support of this conclusion, whilst PDEβ disruption had no significant effect on cGMP levels in parasite extracts, it resulted in a 3-fold increase in intracellular cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). This result provides further confirmation that there is no other PDE capable of regulating cAMP levels in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> schizonts, whereas cGMP levels can still be regulated in the absence of PDEβ. The unchanged cGMP levels are consistent with the absence of an egress phenotype in the PDEβ knockout line, as egress is known to be regulated by PKG.</p>

<p>To gain insights into candidate proteins underpinning the PfPDEβ-null phenotype and to identify the full complement of putative PKA substrates that become phosphorylated upon <italic>PfPDEβ</italic> disruption, we carried out quantitative mass spectrometric global phosphoproteome analysis of mock- and RAP-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts. Our strategy incorporated PKG inhibition (with Compound 2) to ensure that all the schizonts used for the analysis were synchronised precisely at the point when PKG activity is required for merozoite egress. PKG inhibition also allowed us to distinguish between sites phosphorylated by PKA and PKG, because in other species their consensus substrate sequences are very similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref030">30</xref>]. A total of 5,374 phosphosites were identified, distributed over 1,326 proteins (1,192 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and 134 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> proteins). Of these, 893 sites were significantly different (Welch unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) between the RAP- and mock-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5B</xref> left panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s014">S1 Table</xref>), with 341 sites being reduced and 537 sites increased in the knockout. A total of 255 sites were changed by &gt;2-fold, with 239 exhibiting a &gt;2-fold increase but only 16 being decreased by &gt;2-fold in the PDEβ knockout, 7 of which were from the PDEβ N-terminal domain, strongly suggesting that excision of the catalytic domain results in expression of an unstable truncated form of PfPDEβ.</p>
<p>Unphosphorylated peptides present in the phosphopeptide-enriched sample were quantified to show that the vast majority of the 3,170 (2,953 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and 217 <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>) identified proteins were unchanged in abundance in RAP- and mock-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5B</xref> right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s015">S2 Table</xref>). Only eight proteins were significantly less abundant (Welch unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) in the PfPDEβ-null sample, with PfPDEβ itself (2.7-fold) showing the greatest change. The abundance of human dihydrofoate reductase (hDHFR), used as a drug-resistance selection marker during modification of the <italic>PfPDEβ</italic> locus, was also significantly reduced in RAP-treated samples; this was as expected because the gene is excised together with the <italic>PfPDEβ</italic> catalytic domain upon activation of DiCre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Two of the few proteins showing a significant increase in abundance in the PfPDEβ-null sample were human proteins, FK506-binding protein 1A (FKBP1A) (1.96-fold) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) (2.93-fold). These correspond to the RAP-binding fusion partners used in the DiCre system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref028">28</xref>], so this finding is consistent with RAP binding enhancing their stability.</p>
<p>Among the phosphosites significantly increased in the PDEβ knockout, we found a highly significant enrichment in motifs with R or K in the -2 position or -2 and -3 positions relative to the phosphorylation site, resembling mammalian consensus PKA substrate sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s016">S3 Table</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Approximately 52% (279/537) of the significantly up-regulated phosphosites and 63% (151/239) of phosphosites increased by &gt;2-fold conform to the minimal PKA consensus motif R/K, x, pS/pT, consistent with hyperactivation of the enzyme in the absence of PfPDEβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). It is therefore likely that these data define the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> consensus PKA substrate sequence motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). A 1D rank-based annotation analysis found different variations of K/R, K/R, x, S/T to be the most highly enriched motifs in the PDEβ knockout sample, with RRxS (where R is arginine, x is any amino acid and S is serine) occupying the top rank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s016">S3 Table</xref>). Although the canonical R in position -2 seems to be slightly more enriched, phosphosites with a K in the -2 position, if paired with any basic residue in the -3 position, were also highly enriched. Phosphosites with a K in the -2 position were generally more frequent, which may be a consequence of the A/T-rich <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genome. The <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> PKA may have evolved to better accommodate such K-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that PfPDEβ disruption led to dysregulated phosphorylation of proteins involved in a range of cellular processes, including chromatin remodelling, transcription, RNA metabolism, translation, and ubiquitination. A number of proteases, ATPases, ion transporters, and signalling components also showed significant changes in phosphorylation. Furthermore, significant changes were found in components of the parasite-specific glideosome as well as rhoptry- and microneme-associated proteins. PKA consensus motifs were overrepresented in the phosphosites up-regulated in the PfPDEβ knockout in these functional groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s017">S4 Table</xref>). Examination of GO term enrichment, using Gene Ontologizer software, identified significant enrichment of only two GO terms in the significantly down-regulated phosphosites. These were the Biological Process, ‘Ion transport’, and the Cellular Component, ‘Inner membrane pellicle complex’. This reflects a detectable reduction in phosphorylation of significant numbers of proteins within just these two categories in the presence of elevated cAMP levels. One possible explanation for this is that PKA may selectively activate a protein phosphatase to dephosphorylate a restricted number of proteins.</p>
<p>A previous global phosphoproteome of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> schizonts showed that 425 of the 2,541 unique phosphosites resembled a consensus PKA sequence, suggesting an important role for this kinase at this life cycle stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref031">31</xref>]. We previously identified 98 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> schizont phosphosites that were regulated in a PKG-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref003">3</xref>]. Interestingly, 46% of these sites were also differentially regulated in the PDEβ knockout (in the presence of a PKG inhibitor), supporting a functional link between the two pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s014">S1 Table</xref>). Both the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> adenylyl cyclase β (PfACβ) and PfPDEβ had a single PKG-dependent phosphorylation site (S<sub>1572</sub> and S<sub>156</sub>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref003">3</xref>]), which points to a potential mechanism for the regulation of cAMP levels by PKG. Calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) was identified as a likely direct PKG substrate in the previous study, in which it was phosphorylated at position S<sub>64</sub>. However, in the PDEβ knockout schizonts, an alternative CDPK1 phosphosite (Y<sub>44</sub>) was up-regulated &gt;4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), although which kinase performs this tyrosine phosphorylation event is not known. This also raises the question of whether a second spike of calcium release is required post-egress, as previously implied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<title>The requirement for PKG activity upstream of PKA activation is bypassed in PfPDEβ-null parasites</title>
<p>To seek biological validation of the list of potential PKA substrates, we focused on the phosphosite identified in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> myosin A (PF3D7_1342600), MyoA S<sub>19</sub> (increased by 2.6-fold in the PDEβ knockout). MyoA is a component of the so-called glideosome, a complex of parasite proteins involved in actinomyosin-based motility and host cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref035">35</xref>]. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> in mature wild-type <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> schizonts is dependent on PKG activity, as treatment with the PKG inhibitor Compound 2 drastically reduces phosphorylation of this residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref003">3</xref>]. However, another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref036">36</xref>] suggested that phosphorylation of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> is carried out by PKA.</p>
<p>To investigate whether MyoA S<sub>19</sub> is phosphorylated by PKA or by PKG, we blocked PKG activity (and schizont rupture) in PfPDEβ knockout and control parasites with Compound 2. MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation was not detected in Compound 2–blocked control schizonts, consistent with this being a PKG-dependent event. Surprisingly, however, MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation was abundant in Compound 2–treated PfPDEβ-null schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), strongly arguing for this phosphorylation event being PKG independent in the absence of PfPDEβ. In contrast, MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation accumulated in both control and PfPDEβ-null schizonts incubated with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64, which prevents schizont rupture downstream of PKG activation, confirming that MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation occurs just prior to or at egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Levels of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation in E64-blocked wild-type schizonts were sensitive to the PKA inhibitor H89 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), consistent with this phosphorylation event being mediated by PKA. In contrast, treatment of Compound 2–blocked wild-type schizonts with the PDE inhibitor BIPPO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref029">29</xref>] resulted in concentration-dependent enhancement of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation, phenocopying the PfPDEβ-null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>

Western blot of PKG inhibitor–treated (+C2) and E64-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizont proteins from DMSO- and RAP-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> cultures, probed with a phospho-S<sub>19</sub> MyoA antibody. The blot was reprobed with a polyclonal anti-MyoA antibody to determine the relative amounts of MyoA present in each sample. The lower panel shows total protein levels in the gel prior to blotting. The schematic shows the effect of various compounds on egress: Compound 2 and BAPTA-AM block egress upstream of PVM rupture, BIPPO induces egress, and E64 prevents erythrocyte plasma membrane rupture. (B) The PKA inhibitor H89 inhibits MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation. Western blot analysis of E64-arrested wild-type schizonts (mock-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub>) treated with increasing concentrations of the PKA inhibitor H89. A sample was taken before inhibitor addition (start) and a Compound 2–blocked sample served as negative control. Blots were probed with antibodies against phospho-S<sub>19</sub> MyoA, total MyoA, and GAPDH as a loading control. (C) The PDE inhibitor BIPPO induces MyoA phosphorylation. Western blot analysis of Compound 2–arrested mock- or RAP-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts, following incubation with increasing concentrations of the PDE inhibitor BIPPO. A sample was taken before inhibitor addition to show the absence of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation (start). Blots were probed with the same antibodies as in (B). (D) BAPTA-AM inhibits MyoA phosphorylation. Effects of BAPTA-AM on MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation in Compound 2–arrested (top panel) or E64-arrested (bottom panel) PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts following mock or RAP treatment. Western blots were additionally probed with the same antibodies as in B and C. (E) Dual-stained IFAs showing the cellular distribution of AMA1 in RAP- and mock-treated (DMSO) PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts. Schizonts were co-stained with an AMA1 antibody (red) and a HA antibody (green) to detect the presence or absence of PfPDEβ. DAPI (blue) was used to visualise nuclear material. Scale bar, 5 μm. The bar chart (right) shows quantitation of proportions of schizonts displaying apical or peripheral AMA1 staining in E64-arrested PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts.

(F) Western blot analysis of culture supernatants from RAP- and mock-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> purified schizonts sampled over 90 minutes of culture. The blot was probed with antibodies specific for the micronemal proteins AMA1 and EBA175, as well as SERA5, to measure schizont rupture. Positions of molecular weight markers are indicated (left). The blot is representative of at least three independent experiments. (G) Quantitation of AMA1 shedding by IFA in merozoites released from RAP- and mock-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts.

<p>PKG regulates egress upstream of calcium release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref037">37</xref>]. To address the sequence of events and relationship of cGMP, cAMP, and calcium signalling with respect to phosphorylation of MyoA, we investigated the effect of the membrane-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(<italic>o</italic>-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N′</italic>,<italic>N′</italic>-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester) on MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation. BAPTA-AM severely reduced MyoA S<sub>19</sub> phosphorylation in Compound 2–treated PfPDEβ knockout schizonts as well as in E64-blocked wild-type and PfPDEβ knockout schizonts. This indicates that calcium signalling is also required for this phosphorylation event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). It is therefore possible that MyoA<sub>19</sub> could be phosphorylated by a calcium-dependent protein kinase. Collectively, our results suggest that, although phosphorylation of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> is PKG dependent, ablation of PDEβ can bypass the need for PKG activity because of the resulting elevated cAMP levels. Further work will be needed to determine whether MyoA S<sub>19</sub> can be phosphorylated directly by PKA and/or a CDPK in vivo. Interestingly, in the related parasite <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, MyoA S<sub>21</sub>, which may be functionally equivalent to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> MyoA S<sub>19</sub>, has been linked to parasite motility and host cell egress and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref039">39</xref>]. Our results therefore suggest that PKG governs cAMP levels as well as PKA activation and that premature phosphorylation of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> by PKA could lead to premature activation of the actomyosin motor. This may contribute to the severe invasion phenotype observed in PDEβ-null parasites.</p>

<title>The invasion-related protein AMA1 is shed prematurely from PfPDEβ-null merozoites</title>
<p>A second phosphosite that was significantly up-regulated (2.3-fold) in the PfPDEβ-null schizont phosphoproteome and that had previously been linked to PKA activity is S<sub>610</sub> of apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1), a merozoite integral membrane protein that plays an essential role in host cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref040">40</xref>] and that is released onto the merozoite surface from apical secretory organelles called micronemes in a strictly PKG-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref001">1</xref>]. The S<sub>610</sub> phosphosite lies within the short cytoplasmic domain of AMA1. Although the exact function of AMA1 phosphorylation remains unknown, it has been shown that the S<sub>610</sub> modification is one of a series of AMA1 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation events needed for efficient AMA1 function during invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref012">12</xref>]. It has also been reported that this event is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation at T<sub>613</sub> by the parasite glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) and that both events are required for invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref012">12</xref>]. In the present study, we did not detect phosphorylation of AMA1 T<sub>613</sub> in PfPDEβ-null schizonts in which S<sub>610</sub> phosphorylation is stimulated, although it is possible that the PKG blockade included in our phosphoproteome analysis protocol prevented this subsequent phosphorylation step. Comparative IFA analysis of mock- and RAP-treated PfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub> schizonts showed that AMA1 release remained PKG dependent in PfPDEβ-null schizonts (Compound 2 block) and there was no significant difference in the proportion of parasites exhibiting surface-localised AMA1 in the presence of E64, which blocks the red blood cell membrane rupture step of egress but is permissive for AMA1 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). However, examination of supernatants from schizont cultures rupturing in the absence of red blood cells detected significantly more shed AMA1 in the PfPDEβ-null samples than in the control, indicating increased levels of AMA1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). We also detected increased amounts of shed forms of another micronemal invasion-related protein, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), in the PfPDEβ-null supernatant sample, whilst there was no difference in levels of the PV protein SERA5 between the two samples, confirming that PfPDEβ disruption does not affect schizont rupture. Confirmation of enhanced AMA1 shedding in the PfPDEβ-null mutant was obtained by IFA analysis of released merozoites, revealing a significant decrease in the proportion of free PfPDEβ-null merozoites reactive with an antibody against the AMA1 ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). These results suggest that proteolytic cleavage of AMA1 may be increased as a result of enhanced PKA activity in the PfPDEβ-null mutant. Shedding of AMA1 from the merozoite surface is predominantly mediated by the micronemal membrane-bound subtilisin-like protease 2 (SUB2), and to a lesser extent through intramembrane cleavage by the rhomboid-like protease 4 (ROM4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref043">43</xref>]. The enhanced shedding of AMA1 may result from enhanced SUB2 activity. Intriguingly, our global phosphoproteomic analysis identified seven phosphosites in ROM4 elevated by greater than 2-fold following RAP treatment, four of which conform with the PKA consensus motif, and two adjacent residues in SUB2 were also significantly changed. It remains to be shown whether any of these phosphorylation events regulate the activity of these proteases.</p>

<title>Absence of PfPDEβ activity in newly invaded parasites leads to prolonged PKA activity, which interferes with early ring stage development</title>
<p>Activation of PKA at or around egress is thought to be essential for merozoite invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref031">31</xref>]. Our results show that the requisite increase in cAMP levels is governed by PfPDEβ. However, nothing is known regarding the activity status of PKA following erythrocyte invasion. As described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), those PfPDEβ-null parasites that successfully invaded underwent immediate developmental arrest, suggesting that PfPDEβ activity is also essential at this stage of the life cycle. To further explore this finding, we examined the effects of treating early ring stage wild-type parasites with the PDE inhibitor BIPPO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, BIPPO treatment phenocopied the PfPDEβ-null post-invasion phenotype. Previous studies using BIPPO have primarily investigated its effects on cGMP hydrolysis in apicomplexan parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref029">29</xref>]. Our new results demonstrating that this inhibitor is able to target PDEβ show that it has the potential to affect both cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> blood stages. Reasoning that both the PfPDEβ-null and BIPPO-mediated phenotype are likely caused through elevated cAMP or cGMP levels and inappropriate activation of the respective effector kinases PKA or PKG, we examined whether we could rescue the PfPDEβ knockout and PDE inhibitor phenotype by treating early ring stages (0–2 h post-invasion) with PKG or PKA inhibitors. Survival of PfPDEβ-null parasites was not significantly extended by the addition of either kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s006">S6C Fig</xref>), presumably because they had been exposed to elevated cAMP levels over a long period, causing extensive dysregulation and irreversible damage on multiple levels. In contrast, treatment of wild-type ring stage parasites with the PKA inhibitor H89 partially reversed the effects of BIPPO, resulting in normal ring stage development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g007">Fig 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000154.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Treatment with the PKG inhibitor Compound 2 did not reverse BIPPO-mediated killing, clearly attributing the observed phenotype to elevated cAMP levels and untimely PKA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). To further link the PfPDEβ-null and PDE inhibitor phenotypes to untimely PKA activation, we treated ring stage parasites with BIPPO alone or in combination with kinase inhibitors. Total parasite lysates analysed by western blot reveal a clear increase in reactivity, with an antibody against phosphorylated PKA substrate motif in the BIPPO-treated sample. Addition of the PKA inhibitor H89 reduced BIPPO-induced antibody reactivity to control levels, whereas the PKG inhibitor Compound 2 did not, confirming that the post-invasion phenotype is likely due to untimely PKA rather than PKG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000154.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>

<p>Future work will be needed to understand the dynamics of PDEβ function in blood stage malaria parasites, how its translocation from an apical to a peripheral location impacts on the regulation of local cyclic nucleotide levels, and how this might relate to the differential hydrolysis of cGMP and cAMP during merozoite egress and invasion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that PfPDEβ is a dual-function enzyme that is the only PDE responsible for regulation of cAMP levels in blood stage malaria parasites. Ablation of PfPDEβ results in hyperactivity of PKA, with the resulting dysregulated phosphorylation leading to either complete loss of merozoite invasive capacity or lethal defects in parasite development immediately post-invasion. We also provide the first direct genetic evidence for PKA dependence of MyoA S<sub>19</sub> and AMA1 S<sub>610</sub> phosphorylation in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. Several licensed drugs (e.g., Roflumilast, Sildenafil, and Pentoxifylline) that target human PDEs are widely used to treat a range of disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref044">44</xref>]. Our results revealing that PfPDEβ is essential for blood stage <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> replication suggest that PDE inhibitors targeting this enzyme could be developed as new antimalarial drugs, particularly if they also displayed activity against the parasite PDEs expressed in gametocytes and pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle.</p>

<title>Construction of the PfPDEβ-HA tagging and PfPDEβ conditional knockout plasmid</title>
<p>A construct based on the pHH1_SERA5del3DC vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000154.ref028">28</xref>] was generated to C-terminally tag the endogenous <italic>Pfpdeβ</italic> locus with a 3×HA tag. The construct contained a 0.9-kb 3′ fragment of the <italic>PfPDEβ</italic> gene, to facilitate single crossover recombination, fused to the HA tag. A loxP site was placed downstream and the 3′UTR of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> DT. The construct also contained a second loxP site and a hDHFR gene, which confers resistance to the antifolate WR99210. The resulting plasmid pPfPDEβ-HA was originally generated with the intention of conditionally ablating PfPDEβ function by excision of the 3′UTR flanked by loxP sites.</p>
<p>To create the PfPDEβ conditional knockout plasmid, a synthetic, partially recodonised (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> codon usage) PfPDEβ sequence was synthesised by GenScript. The sequence comprised 1 kb of native <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> PfPDEβ targeting sequence containing native PDEβ sequence to drive recombination by single crossover, a loxP site inserted into intron 6 (of 8), and the remaining 819 bp of the PfPDEβ exonic sequence were recodonised to prevent recombination downstream of the loxP site. A triple HA tag was added to the 3′ end of the sequence, followed by a stop codon. The synthetic PDEβ gene containing the internal loxP site and the recodonised sequence was cloned into pPfPDEβ-HA, replacing the 0.9-kb fragment to yield pPfPDEβ<sub>ΔcatHA</sub>.</p>

Default MaxQuant parameters were used with the following adjustments: reporter ion MS2 with the sixplex TMT isobaric labels was selected, Phospho(STY) was added as a variable modification, and ‘Filter labeled amino acids’ was deselected. Protein levels (MaxQuant ProteinGroups) were calculated from nonphosphorylated material quantified in the phosphopeptide-enriched sample.

<title>Generation of a PfPDEβ-HA line and tagged protein expression across the intra-erythrocytic cycle.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic showing the approach to C-terminally tag the endogenous <italic>PfPDEβ</italic> gene with a 3×HA tag. The plasmid construct was transfected into a line expressing a RAP-inducible Cre recombinase, upon activation of which the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) is excised. Excision of the 3′UTR did not result in the anticipated mRNA destabilisation and concomitant knockdown of protein levels. However, the created line proved useful for PDEβ localisation and enzymatic activity studies. Black arrows denote promoters and lollipops represent transcription terminators (grey circle represents the heterologous <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei dhfr-ts</italic> terminator). Positions of PCR amplicons verifying integration as well as absence of wild-type locus (see [B]) are indicated by black bars. (B) Diagnostic PCRs showing correct integration (INT) of the plasmid via single crossover into the PDEβ locus as well as absence of wild-type locus (WT) for two clones. The band obtained with primers specific for the plasmid (PLS) shows that multiple plasmid copies are integrated into the target locus. (C) Representative images of formaldehyde-fixed thin smears of ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages of PDEβ-HA parasites probed with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (green). Parasite nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). (D) Full-length PfPDEβ-HA is expressed in early and late ring stages. Total lysates obtained from synchronous, high parasitaemia ring stage cultures were subjected to western blot analysis with monoclonal antibodies to the HA tag and the PfGAPDH. A section of the gel stained for total protein (stain-free gel) is shown as a loading control. (E) Dual-staining IFAs performed on thin smears of unblocked PfPDEβ-HA schizont cultures. Slides were stained with anti-HA (red), EBA175, or AMA1 (green). Nuclear material was visualised by DAPI (blue).

<title>Analysis of clones obtained from a RAP-treated PfPDEβΔcatHA culture confirms essentiality of PDEβ for blood stage growth.</title>
<p>(A) PCR analysis of the PDEβ locus in six clones grown from a RAP-treated culture grown in the absence of WR99210 for 4 weeks. None of the six clones carried the excised PDEβ locus. A weak or absent integration-specific band is consistent with partial or full reversion of the unexcised PDEβ locus to wild type. (B) Growth curves for the six clones determined after 4 weeks of culture in the absence of WR99210 by daily measurements of DNA content via SYBR Green fluorescence (RFU). Means of technical triplicates are presented. Parasite clones were grown in the absence (−WR) and presence (+WR) of WR99210. Drug challenge reveals that three out of six clones had largely reverted to the drug-sensitive wild-type PDEβ locus.

<title>Comparison of egress, invasion, and PKG-dependent calcium release in PDEβ KO and wild-type parasites.</title>
<p>(A) Decline in schizontaemia over time in synchronous DMSO- and RAP-treated PfPDEβΔcatHA schizont cultures as determined by FACS on SYBR Green–stained cultures. Samples were taken every 45 minutes (T1–T10) and 12 hours later (T11). The data are mean schizontaemia (starting schizontaemia adjusted to 5%) from two biological replicates carried out in triplicate, and the error bars denote the standard deviation. (B) Increase in ring stage parasitaemia over time in synchronous DMSO- and RAP-treated PfPDEβΔcatHA cultures as determined by FACS on SYBR Green–stained cultures. Samples were taken every 45 minutes (T1–T10) and 12 hours later (T11). The data are mean ring stage parasitaemia (untreated starting parasitaemia adjusted to 1%) from two biological replicates carried out in triplicate, and the error bars denote the standard deviation. (C) DMSO- and +RAP–treated PfPDEβΔcatHA schizonts loaded with the membrane-permeable fluorescent calcium reporter Fluo-4 AM were exposed to PDE inhibitors BIPPO (2 μM) and zaprinast (ZAP) (100 μM), with or without the PKG inhibitor Compound 2 (C2) (2 μM), and calcium release measured as Fluo-4 fluorescence. Inhibitor-induced calcium release was normalised to values obtained for calcium ionophore, which was set to 100%. Data presented are means from three independent experiments performed in technical triplicates. Error bars, SEM. A paired <italic>t</italic> test showed no significant difference in response to either PDE inhibitor between wild-type (DMSO) and PDEβ KO schizonts. (D) IFA analysis suggests that mononucleated PDEβ knockout parasites are inside erythrocytes. Blood films of RAP- and mock-treated PfPDEβΔcatHA cultures containing segmented schizonts and early ring stages were stained with monoclonal antibodies recognising MSP1-83, which is shed at invasion, and MSP1-19, which is carried into the erythrocyte. There was no difference between the two conditions in the proportion of parasites staining with either antibody.
