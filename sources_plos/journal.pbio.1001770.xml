<abstract>
<p>Industry-sponsored clinical drug studies are associated with publication of outcomes that favor the sponsor, even when controlling for potential bias in the methods used. However, the influence of sponsorship bias has not been examined in preclinical animal studies. We performed a meta-analysis of preclinical statin studies to determine whether industry sponsorship is associated with either increased effect sizes of efficacy outcomes and/or risks of bias in a cohort of published preclinical statin studies. We searched Medline (January 1966–April 2012) and identified 63 studies evaluating the effects of statins on atherosclerosis outcomes in animals. Two coders independently extracted study design criteria aimed at reducing bias, results for all relevant outcomes, sponsorship source, and investigator financial ties. The I<sup>2</sup> statistic was used to examine heterogeneity. We calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each outcome and pooled data across studies to estimate the pooled average SMD using random effects models. In <italic>a priori</italic> subgroup analyses, we assessed statin efficacy by outcome measured, sponsorship source, presence or absence of financial conflict information, use of an optimal time window for outcome assessment, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. The effect of statins was significantly larger for studies sponsored by nonindustry sources (−1.99; 95% CI −2.68, −1.31) versus studies sponsored by industry (−0.73; 95% CI −1.00, −0.47) (<italic>p</italic> value&lt;0.001). Statin efficacy did not differ by disclosure of financial conflict information, use of an optimal time window for outcome assessment, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. Possible reasons for the differences between nonindustry- and industry-sponsored studies, such as selective reporting of outcomes, require further study.</p>

<p>Industry-sponsored clinical drug studies are associated with publication of outcomes that favor the sponsor, even when controlling for potential bias in the methods used. However, the influence of sponsorship bias has not been examined in preclinical animal studies. We performed a meta-analysis to identify whether industry sponsorship is associated with increased risks of bias or effect sizes of outcomes in a cohort of published preclinical studies of the effects of statins on outcomes related to atherosclerosis. We found that in contrast to clinical studies, the effect of statins was significantly larger for studies sponsored by nonindustry sources versus studies sponsored by industry. Furthermore, statin efficacy did not differ with respect to disclosure of financial conflict information, use of an optimal time window for outcome assessment, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. Possible reasons for the differences between nonindustry- and industry-sponsored studies, such as selective outcome reporting, require further study. Overall, our findings provide empirical evidence regarding the impact of funding and other methodological criteria on research outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Preclinical studies are performed to evaluate a drug's efficacy in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Lo1">[1]</xref>. In addition, the results from animal studies are a critical—and often the only—input to evaluating potential toxicity of drugs before they proceed to human testing. Minimizing bias in the design, conduct, and reporting of preclinical animal research should produce more methodologically sound studies and results that provide better protection of humans from exposure to drugs tested in toxicology studies. Policies to reduce biases in preclinical animal studies should lead to the initiation of appropriate clinical trials that are an efficient use of resources and minimize risk to humans.</p>
<p>For the evaluation of human clinical research, there is a distinction between assessing risks of bias and methodological quality. Risks of bias are methodological criteria of a study that can introduce a systematic error in the magnitude or direction of the results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Higgins1">[2]</xref>. Some risks of bias in animal studies have been empirically identified. For example, analyses of animal studies testing interventions for stroke, multiple sclerosis, and emergency medicine have shown that lack of randomization, blinding of investigators, specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the animal subjects, statistical power, and failure to use comorbid animals are associated with inflated effect estimates of pharmaceutical interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Bebarta1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Vesterinen1">[7]</xref>. Using an optimal time window for outcome assessment and specifying whether all animals in the study are accounted for are also associated with reduced risks of bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Marshall1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-National1">[9]</xref>. An assessment of a study's methodology also includes evaluation of additional study criteria related to how a study is conducted (e.g., in compliance with animal subjects guidelines) or reported (e.g., study population described).</p>
<p>Considerable evidence shows a strong association between industry sponsorship, investigator financial conflicts of interest (COIs), and biased outcomes in clinical research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Higgins1">[2]</xref>. Industry sponsorship biases the written research record towards outcomes that are favorable to the sponsor, even when controlling for study design criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Barnes1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Yank1">[16]</xref>. Financial ties between clinical researchers and industry have also been associated with reduced data sharing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Blumenthal1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Campbell2">[19]</xref>. There is little evidence regarding the influence of these financial COIs on the integrity of preclinical animal studies.</p>
<p>Statins are an interesting class of drugs for investigating biases that influence research outcomes because there are a number of statins manufactured by competing companies; thus, there are financial incentives to develop statins that are more effective or safer than others. Previous research has shown that randomized controlled clinical trials of head-to-head comparisons of statins with other drugs are more likely to report results and conclusions favoring the sponsor's product compared to the comparator drug, even when controlling for other risks of bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Bero1">[14]</xref>. Clinically, statins are widely prescribed as effective agents for lowering cholesterol and other lipids. Statins have a number of other potential clinical uses that have been tested in animals including treating atherosclerosis, fracture healing, and endothelial dysfunction, and statins possess both anticarcinogenic and anticoagulant effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Davignon1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Mundy1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to determine whether industry sponsorship is associated with increased effect sizes of efficacy outcomes and/or increased risks of bias in a cohort of published animal studies examining the effects of statins on atherosclerosis. We show that nonindustry-sponsored animal studies contained outcomes that were more favorable to the test statin compared to industry-sponsored studies and that statin efficacy did not differ between studies with high and low risks of bias.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001770-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we identified 4,592 potentially relevant studies. After screening study titles and abstracts, 71 citations containing atherosclerosis outcomes met our inclusion criteria and were identified for full text evaluation. After reviewing the full text, eight studies did not meet our inclusion criteria and were excluded. Overall, 63 total articles were included in this study. Of these 63 articles, 54 had quantitative data and 49 had analyzable data for the meta-analysis.</p>

Only three of the 63 included studies were sponsored solely by industry sources, although 16 were partially sponsored by industry. The majority of studies (35 of 54 studies; 64.8%) that reported quantitative results reported results that favored statins. Similarly, 52 of 63 studies contained author conclusions that favored statin use.</p>

<p>Overall, test animal characteristics and a description of the animal environment were the most commonly reported criteria [62 of 63 studies (98.4%) and 60 of 63 studies (95.2%), respectively].</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Specific Measures by Category of Outcome</title>
<p>The results were classified into the following categories, many of which contained multiple measures: (1) vessel measure, (2) plaque measure, (3) incidence of lesions, (4) occlusion, (5) plaque type/severity, (6) coronary stenosis, and (7) plaque stability.</p>
<p>Vessel measures included a myriad of outcomes: aortic lesion development, intima/media ratios, intimal thickening, maximal thickness, vessel wall area, lumen area, media size, carotid plaque, thickness of elastic layer, external diameter, aortic peak velocity (Vp), mean velocity (Vm), velocity time integral (VTI), and the external elastic membrane area (EEMA). Plaque measures included atherosclerosis plaque/lesion/surface area/thickness, plaque volume, aorta/artery maximum thickness, aorta/artery plaque volume, perimeter of plaque, average size of individual lesions, fatty streak area, frequency of lesions with hemorrhage, necrotic area, area of atheroma, and large necrotic core. Lastly, other measures included occlusion and fibrous cap measures.</p>
<p>The most commonly reported outcome categories were plaque measures, which were reported in 50 of 63 studies (79.4%), and vessel measures, which were reported in 26 of 63 studies (41.3%). Six studies (9.5%) reported coronary stenosis outcomes, whereas five studies (7.9%) reported plaque stability outcomes. Other outcome categories reported in identified studies were plaque type/severity (<italic>n</italic> = 4; 6.3%), incidence of lesions (<italic>n</italic> = 2; 3.2%), and occlusion outcomes (<italic>n</italic> = 1; 1.6%).</p>

<title>Year of publication</title>
<p>The studies were published between 1991 and 2012. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001770-g002">Figure 2</xref>, studies published between 2010 and 2012 yielded greater efficacy estimates than studies published before 2010 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07). Although we hypothesized that more recent studies would have lower risks of bias given that the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) Guidelines for reporting animal research were introduced in 2010, we found that only randomization, whether all animals were accounted for, and sample size were reported more frequently after publication of the ARRIVE Guidelines. Randomization was reported in 11 of the 15 (73.3%) studies that were published post-ARRIVE compared to 19 of the 48 (39.6%) studies published pre-ARRIVE. All animals were accounted for in 12 of the 15 (80%) studies published post-ARRIVE compared to 27 of the 48 (56.3%) studies published pre-ARRIVE. Sample size was reported in all 15 studies published post-ARRIVE compared to 41 of 48 studies (85.4%) published pre-ARRIVE.</p>

In only one study did an author disclose a financial COI; therefore, subgroup analysis by this criterion was not performed. Instead, we conducted a subgroup analysis by whether the study contained a COI statement or not. The effect of statins is not different in studies with no financial conflict compared to studies with no conflict statement (test for subgroup differences: <italic>p</italic> value = 0.44). The effect of statins is not different in studies with optimal timing of outcome measurement compared to studies without optimal timing (test for subgroup differences: <italic>p</italic> value = 0.66), in studies with all animals accounted for compared to studies that did not account for all animals (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.74), in studies with no inclusion criteria described compared to studies with partial inclusion criteria (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.37), or in studies with blinding compared to studies with no blinding (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.81).

<title>Risks of Bias by Sources of Sponsorship</title>
<p>To explore the differences in risks of bias between studies reporting different sources of sponsorship, we compared pooled efficacy estimates from studies with sponsorship from industry, nonindustry source(s), or no sponsorship statement stratified by risks of bias that are associated with effect size: randomization (partial versus no randomization), blinding of investigators (yes versus no), and all animals accounted for (yes versus no).</p>
<p>Comparisons between nonindustry-sponsored studies and studies sponsored by industry sources yielded higher efficacy estimates for statins in nonindustry-sponsored studies with partial randomization (test for subgroup difference: <italic>p</italic> = 0.008).

<title>Sensitivity Analysis Using Fixed Effect Model</title>
<p>We performed a sensitivity analysis using a fixed-effects model rather than a random-effects model to evaluate differences in pooled estimates. The pooled effect of statins on the risk of atherosclerosis using a fixed-effects model was more attenuated (SMD = −1.01; 95% CI −1.17, −0.86) than the random-effects model (SMD = −1.25; 95% CI −1.56, −0.94). Similarly, the pooled effect among nonindustry-sponsored studies using a fixed-effects model was less (SMD = −1.44; 95% CI −1.70, −1.17) than the random-effects model (SMD = −1.99; 95% CI −2.68, −1.31). The pooled effect among industry-sponsored studies remained nearly unchanged (SMD = −0.72; 95% CI −0.96, −0.48 versus SMD = −0.73; 95% CI −1.00, −0.47).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nonindustry-sponsored studies yielded greater efficacy estimates than industry-sponsored studies. Despite subgroup analyses by risks of bias, including financial COI information, optimal timing of outcome measurement, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization, efficacy estimates for nonindustry-sponsored studies remained significantly greater than industry-sponsored studies. This finding does not correspond to clinical studies that have examined sponsorship bias. Reviews of clinical drug studies have shown that industry funding sources and financial ties of investigators (including university- or industry-affiliated investigators) are associated with increased treatment effect sizes and other favorable outcomes for the sponsors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Lundh1">[27]</xref>. One reason for the discrepancy between the association of funding source and outcome in preclinical and clinical studies could be that the interests of the pharmaceutical industry are best served by underestimating efficacy prior to clinical trials and overestimating efficacy in clinical trials. By underestimating efficacy in preclinical studies, the pharmaceutical industry could reduce the money spent on clinical trials that did not lead to marketable products. By overestimating efficacy in clinical trials, the pharmaceutical industry could skew the evidence towards findings that would lead to drug approval and a marketable product.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for our finding that nonindustry-sponsored studies demonstrated greater efficacy than industry-sponsored studies, independent of other risks of bias, is that an overwhelming number of studies in our sample had statistically significant results in favor of the test statin. Ninety-four percent (<italic>n</italic> = 46 of 49) of studies yielded point estimates favoring statins. This finding is consistent with research demonstrating that the vast majority of clinical studies report statistically significant results for the interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Ioannidis1">[28]</xref>. Similarly, overly optimistic findings in animal studies could skew the data and send potentially ineffective drugs to clinical trials. Several studies have shown that favorable findings in animal studies often are not reproduced in clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-OCollins1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-vanderWorp1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among clinical studies, most discovered true associations are inflated due to methodological flaws <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Ioannidis1">[28]</xref>. Although we could not detect differences in risks of bias between the nonindustry- and industry-sponsored studies in our sample, substantial risks of bias existed across all studies. For example, none of the studies in our sample included sample size calculations, conducted intention-to-treat analysis, or had concealment of allocation. Approximately half of the studies did not report randomization, blinding of investigators, or the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the animal subjects.</p>
<p>Our inability to detect an association of risks of bias with effect sizes might be due to the poor reporting of these criteria. Among the 36 journals where the 63 studies were published, we determined that eight journals (22.2%) required only that authors report compliance with animal welfare regulations in their article, 17 (47.2%) had specific reporting requirements, and 11 (30.6%) did not have any reporting requirements. Recent calls for reporting criteria for animal studies recognize the need for the adoption and enforcement of journal reporting standards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Landis1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-National2">[34]</xref>. In clinical research, reporting of risk of bias criteria improved as investigators began performing risk of bias assessments for systematic reviews and other purposes and journals began adopting reporting standards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Turner1">[35]</xref>. As happened for clinical research, reporting of animal research is also likely to improve if risk of bias assessments becomes more common.</p>
<p>Reporting biases (i.e., failure to publish entire studies or selective outcome reporting) could explain the skewing of our sample towards favorable results and the very small proportion of industry-sponsored studies identified. The effect of publication bias has been documented in both animal and clinical studies. Studies of reporting biases in clinical research have shown that industry-sponsored clinical trials are less likely to be published in full than studies with other sponsors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Chan1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Lee1">[40]</xref>. Similarly, a meta-analysis of animal studies assessing interventions for stroke showed that publication bias could account for at least a third of the efficacy reported in systematic reviews of animal stroke studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Sena1">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, data from a national survey of all animal laboratories in the Netherlands indicate that publication bias appears to be more prevalent in industry-sponsored animal research relative to animal research sponsored by nonindustry sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-terRiet1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the direction of outcomes showed that industry-sponsored studies were less likely to have results that favored the statin, but more likely to have conclusions favoring the statin, compared to studies sponsored by nonindustry sources. The greater discordance between results and conclusions in industry-sponsored studies compared to nonindustry-sponsored studies has also been observed in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and trials of drugs conducted in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Yank1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Lundh1">[27]</xref>. The presence of “spin” in the conclusions of randomized trials—that is, specific reporting strategies to highlight that the experimental treatment is effective despite a statistically nonsignificant effect for the primary outcome—has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Boutron1">[42]</xref>. Further analysis of spin in the conclusions of animal studies is warranted.</p>
<p>Our study reveals a lack of reporting of harm-related metrics. Not a single study in our cohort assessed adverse events following the statin intervention; all 63 studies were nonequivalence efficacy studies. As toxicity data from animal studies must be submitted to drug regulatory authorities before a compound can proceed to testing in humans, it is surprising that so little data on harm appear in the published scientific literature. Although only one out of 22 study criteria from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist addresses reporting of drug harms, attempts have been made to improve reporting of harm data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Ioannidis2">[43]</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has a few limitations. We restricted our search to the Medline database. Although we may have retrieved further studies had we searched additional databases, we found a sufficient number of studies (<italic>n</italic> = 63) to test our hypothesis examining the association of industry sponsorship, risks of bias, and research outcomes. Many of the studies we included had small samples sizes and measured multiple outcomes in a single animal. Therefore, when combining outcome measures within studies, we were unable to avoid double-counting animals within studies. We obviated this issue by averaging effect estimates and variances within studies. It should be noted that variances of SMDs are expected to be similar for different outcomes on the same animals. Therefore, the average variance across multiple outcomes should be similar to the variance for one outcome. Some outcomes were excluded from the meta-analyses due to missing data or the type of outcome estimates calculated. Thus, it is possible that our analyses overrepresented studies and outcomes with analyzable data.</p>
<p>Additionally, the types of statins compared between studies varied. Although the aim of this study was not to compare the efficacy of specific types of statins, we acknowledge the possibility of added heterogeneity due to unequal efficacy between statin types. Additional heterogeneity was likely present due to differences in or inadequate descriptions of the control groups in the studies.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Nonindustry-sponsored studies demonstrated greater efficacy than industry-sponsored studies, independent of other risks of bias. Because demonstrating drug efficacy in human studies is linked to drug company profits, drug companies may have more incentive to publish favorable efficacy findings of human drug studies than animal studies. Overall, the influence of funding source, risks of bias (such as lack of randomization and blinding), overwhelming proportion of studies reporting statistically significant efficacy outcomes, and lack of reporting of harm outcomes suggest a need for improving the integrity of preclinical animal research.</p>

<title>Coding of Results</title>
<p>Only results for atherosclerosis-related outcomes were recorded. If multiple time points were reported, we included all time points in the meta-analysis as to not assume a primary endpoint or arbitrarily assign an endpoint in the analysis. For each result we collected the raw data (often derived from tables, graphs, figures, etc.), measure of effect, confidence interval, measure of variability, <italic>p</italic> value, and statistical test used.</p>
<p>Each outcome was assigned to one of the following categories: (1) vessel measure, (2) plaque measure, (3) incidence of lesions, (4) occlusion, (5) plaque type/severity, (6) coronary stenosis, and (7) plaque stability.</p>
<p>Results were then categorized as (1) favorable, if the result was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and in the direction of the statin being more efficacious or less harmful (in the case of adverse effects); (2) unfavorable, if the result was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05) or significant in the wrong direction (e.g., statin statistically more harmful than nonstatin treatment group); and (3) neutral, if the statin was significantly different in the direction favoring the statin against one control group (e.g., early control) but not significantly different compared to a second control group (e.g., late control).</p>
<p>If an outcome was measured over multiple time points or concentrations, it was categorized as (1) favorable if at least one measurement was in favor of the statin or (2) unfavorable if there were no measurements in favor of the statin.</p>
<p>For the meta-analysis, for each included result, we extracted data for mean outcome, standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), and the number of treated and untreated animals.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4g">
<title>Sponsorship Source</title>

<title>Financial Ties of Authors</title>
<p>Information about financial ties was coded as (1) at least one author of the study reported having a financial COI, (2) all authors reported having no COIs, and (3) there was no disclosure statement.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4i">
<title>Role of the Financial Sponsor</title>
<p>For studies with a disclosed sponsor of any type, the role of the sponsor was categorized as (1) not mentioned, (2) statement that the sponsor was not involved, and (3) statement that the sponsor was involved. When applicable, we reported specifically how the sponsor was involved (e.g., in the design, analysis, or dissemination of the study).</p>
</sec><sec id="s4j">
<title>Author Conclusion of Included Study</title>
<p>For each published article, author conclusions were categorized as (1) favorable to the statin if the overall conclusion suggested that the statin is efficacious and safe. Conclusions were also favorable if the data empirically supported an author's hypothesis that the statin was efficacious and/or safe. For studies containing combination therapies (e.g., statin combined with another nonstatin drug), conclusions were coded as (1) favoring the statin if the author's hypothesis that the drugs have synergistic effects was supported; (2) unfavorable to the statin if the overall conclusion suggested that the statin is not efficacious or safe, less effective or safe relative to the active comparator, or if the author's hypothesis was not supported; and (3) neutral to the statin if the authors did not draw a conclusion regarding the statin or stated that the limitations of the study were so severe that the results were not valid. Conclusions were also neutral if the hypothesis or conclusion did not mention the statin or if the statin was considered comparable (in efficacy or toxicity) to the active comparator.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4k">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We report the frequencies of each study design criterion and the coding of the results and conclusions by sponsorship source.</p>
<p>To test our hypothesis that industry sponsorship is associated with increased effect sizes of efficacy outcomes and/or increased risks of bias, we conducted a meta-analysis of the studies that had analyzable data. For a study to have analyzable data, an author needed to report both a mean value and a measure of dispersion (standard error or standard deviation) or provide adequate data so that we could calculate these measures ourselves. Not all studies containing quantitative (numerical) data had analyzable data.</p>
<p>We calculated the effect of statins using an SMD for each outcome. Due to the lack of independence of animals between outcomes within studies, we averaged SMDs and variances across outcomes for each study, yielding <italic>k</italic> average SMDs and variances for <italic>k</italic> studies. We pooled the data across studies and estimated summary average SMDs using random-effects models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-DerSimonian1">[53]</xref>. Specifically, we estimated the average SMD for each included study and used the inverse variance method to calculate study weights. The inverse variance method assumes that the variance for each study is inversely proportional to its importance; therefore, more weight is given to studies with less variance than studies with greater variance. The SMD null hypothesis (Ho: estimate = 0) states that there is no difference in effect of statin use on risk of atherosclerosis when compared to a control/placebo. A number less than zero suggests that the statin reduces the risk of atherosclerosis when compared to control or placebo. A number greater than zero suggests that the statin increases the risk of atherosclerosis when compared to the control or placebo.</p>
<p>We examined heterogeneity among the studies using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. We interpreted an I<sup>2</sup> estimate greater than 50% as indicating moderate or high levels of heterogeneity. We anticipated high levels of heterogeneity as previous meta-analyses of animal studies have found high levels of heterogeneity between studies, potentially resulting from typical, small sample sizes in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001770-Macleod3">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>We further investigated the potential causes of heterogeneity by conducting <italic>a priori</italic> subgroup analyses using the χ<sup>2</sup> statistic with a significance level of 0.10. We conducted a subgroup analysis by type of outcome measure because we hypothesized that the efficacy of statins could vary by outcome. We performed subgroup analyses by study criteria that we hypothesized would be associated with effect sizes: financial ties of authors, sponsorship source, optimal timing, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. We also performed a subgroup analysis by date of publication as we hypothesized that more recent studies would have lower risks of bias given that the ARRIVE Guidelines for reporting animal research were introduced in 2010. We assessed whether or not authors reported the following criteria more frequently postpublication of the ARRIVE Guidelines: a statement by authors regarding the ethical treatment of animals, a description of the test animal characteristics, environmental parameters, sample size, randomization, blinding of investigators, all animals accounted for, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>We evaluated differences in pooled effect estimates between declared sponsorship sources by risk of bias criteria to determine if the effect between sponsorship sources differed by specific risks of bias.</p>
