<abstract>
<p>The analysis of the activity of neuronal cultures is considered to be a good proxy of the functional connectivity of <italic>in vivo</italic> neuronal tissues. Thus, the functional complex network inferred from activity patterns is a promising way to unravel the interplay between structure and functionality of neuronal systems. Here, we monitor the spontaneous self-sustained dynamics in neuronal cultures formed by interconnected aggregates of neurons (<italic>clusters</italic>). Dynamics is characterized by the fast activation of groups of clusters in sequences termed <italic>bursts</italic>. The analysis of the time delays between clusters' activations within the bursts allows the reconstruction of the <italic>directed</italic> functional connectivity of the network. We propose a method to statistically infer this connectivity and analyze the resulting properties of the associated complex networks. Surprisingly enough, in contrast to what has been reported for many biological networks, the clustered neuronal cultures present assortative mixing connectivity values, meaning that there is a preference for clusters to link to other clusters that share similar functional connectivity, as well as a rich-club core, which shapes a ‘connectivity backbone’ in the network. These results point out that the grouping of neurons and the assortative connectivity between clusters are intrinsic survival mechanisms of the culture.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The architecture of neuronal cultures is the result of an intricate self-organization process that balances structural and dynamical demands. We observe that when the motility of neurons is allowed, these neurons organize into compact clusters. These neuronal assemblies have an intrinsic synchronous activity that makes the whole cluster firing at unison. Clusters connect to their neighbors to form a network with rich spontaneous dynamics. This dynamics ultimately shapes a directed functional network whose properties are investigated using network descriptors. We find that the networks are formed such that preference in connectivity between clusters is based on the similarity between their activity, a property that is called <italic>assortative mixing</italic> in networks' language. This particular choice of connectivity correlations must be rooted to basic survival mechanisms for the neurons constituting the culture.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The theory of complex networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Dorogovtsev1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Estrada1">[5]</xref> has proven to be a useful framework for the study of the interplay between structure and functionality in social, technological, and biological systems. A complex network is no more than a specific representation of the interactions between the elements of the system in terms of nodes (elements) and links (interactions) in a graph. The analysis of such resulting abstraction of the system, the network, provides clues about regularities that can be connected with certain functionalities, or even be related to organization mechanisms that help to understand the rules behind the system's complexity. Particularly, in biological systems, the characterization of the emergent self-organization of their components is of utmost importance to comprehend the mechanisms of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Eckmann1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Gross1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges in biology and neuroscience is the ultimate understanding of the structure and function of neuronal systems, in particular the human brain, whose representation in terms of complex networks is especially appealing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Bullmore1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Sporns1">[10]</xref>. In this case, structural connectivity corresponds to the anatomical description of brain circuits whereas the functional connectivity is related to the statistical dependence between neuronal activity.</p>
<p>Network theory and its mathematical framework have provided, through the analysis of the distribution of links, statistical measures that highlight key topological features of the network under study. These measures have facilitated the comprehension of processes as complex as brain development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Sporns2">[11]</xref>, learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Bassett1">[12]</xref> and dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Seeley1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Zhou1">[14]</xref>. Particularly, these measures have unfolded new relationships between brain dynamics and functionality. For instance, synchronization between neuronal assemblies in the developing hippocampus has been ascribed to the existence of super-connected nodes in a scale-free topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Bonifazi1">[15]</xref>; efficient information transfer has been associated to circuits with small-world features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Latora1">[16]</xref>, such as in the the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Watts1">[17]</xref> or the brain cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Sporns3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Harriger1">[19]</xref>; and the coexistence of both segregated and integrated activity in the brain has been hypothesized to arise from a modular circuit architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Hagmann1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-ZamoraLpez1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>A network measure that has recently caught substantial attention is the <italic>assortativity coefficient</italic>, which quantifies the preference of a node to attach to another one with similar (<italic>assortative mixing</italic>) or dissimilar (<italic>disassortative mixing</italic>) number of connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Newman2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Newman3">[24]</xref>. Assortative networks have been observed in both structural <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Hagmann1">[20]</xref> and functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Eguluz1">[25]</xref> human brain networks. It has been proposed that assortative networks exhibit a modular organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-AvalosGaytn1">[26]</xref>, display an efficient dynamics that is stable to noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-deFranciscis1">[27]</xref>, and manifest resilience to node deletion (either random or targeted) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Newman2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Rubinov1">[28]</xref>. Resilience is ascribed to the preferred interconnectivity of high-degree nodes, which shape a ‘connectivity backbone’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Achard1">[29]</xref> that preserves network integrity. The existence of such a tightly interconnected community is generally known as the ‘rich-club’ phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Harriger1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-ZamoraLpez1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Colizza1">[30]</xref>. On the other hand, disassortative networks, such as the ones identified in the yeast's protein-protein interaction and the neuronal network of <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Newman2">[23]</xref>, are more vulnerable to targeted attacks. However, in these disassortative networks, the tendency of high degree nodes to connect with low degree ones results in a star-like topology that favors information processing across the network.</p>
<p>The assortativty coefficient is usually calculated through the Pearson correlation coefficient between the unweighted degrees of each link in the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Newman2">[23]</xref>. To account for effects associated to large networks, the Spearman assortativity measure was introduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Litvak1">[31]</xref> and, later, weighted assortativity measures were proposed to include the weight in degree-degree dependencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Leung1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>To better understand the importance of these network measures in describing neuronal networks, <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations in the form of neuronal cultures have been introduced given their accessibility and easy manipulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Eckmann1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Wheeler1">[33]</xref>. Two major types of cultured neuronal networks are of particular interest. In a first type, neurons are plated on a substrate that contains a layer of adhesive proteins. Neurons firmly adhere to the substrate, leading to cultures with a homogeneous distribution of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Wagenaar1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Tibau1">[37]</xref>. In a second type, neurons are plated without any facilitation for adhesion. Neurons then spontaneously group into small, compact assemblies termed <italic>clusters</italic> that connect to one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Teller1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-SheinIdelson1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>The formation of a clustered architecture from an initially isotropic configuration is an intriguing self-organization process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Segev1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-SheinIdelson1">[41]</xref>. This feature has made clustered networks attractive platforms to study the development of neuronal circuits as well as the interplay between structural and functional connectivity at intermediate, <italic>mesoscopic</italic> scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Gabay1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Soussou1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Shein1">[45]</xref>. Moreover, the existence of a two-level network, one within a cluster and another between clusters, has made clustered cultures appealing to study dynamical and topological features of hierarchical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Segev1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-SheinIdelson1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Shein1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-SheinIdelson2">[46]</xref> as well as modular networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-SheinIdelson2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Berdondini1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this work we use spontaneous activity measurements in clustered neuronal cultures to render the corresponding directed functional networks and study their topological properties. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that uses the propagation of activity between clusters as a measure of “causality”, although strictly speaking we should refer to as a sequence of delayed activations, giving rise to functional connections that are both directed and weighted. Based on this weighted nature of the network, we propose a new measure of assortativity that explicitly incorporates the weight of the links. We observed that all the studied functional networks derived from clustered cultures show a strong, positive assortative mixing that is maintained along different stages of development. On the contrary, homogeneous cultures tend to be weakly assortative, or neutral. Finally, in combination with experiments that measure the robustness of network activity to circuitry deterioration, we show that the strongly assortative, clustered networks are more resistant to damage compared to the weakly assortative, homogeneous ones. Our work provides a prominent example of the existence of assortativity in biological networks, and illustrates the utility of clustered neuronal cultures to investigate topological traits and the emergence of complex phenomena, such as self-organization and resilience, in living neuronal networks.</p>

<title>Experiments</title>
<p>We used rat cortical neurons in all the experiments. As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, neurons were dissociated and seeded homogeneously on a glass substrate. Cultures were limited to circular areas <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in diameter for better control and full monitoring of network behavior. The lack of adhesive proteins in the substrate rapidly favored cell-to-cell attachment and aggregation, giving rise to <italic>clustered</italic> cultures that evolved quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). By <italic>day in vitro</italic> (DIV) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, cultures contained dozens of small aggregates, which coalesced and grew in size as the culture matured. Connections between clusters as well as initial traces of spontaneous activity were observed as early as DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Cultures comprised of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> interconnected clusters by DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and were sufficiently stable and rich in activity for measurements. Although the strength of the connections in the network and its dynamics evolved further, we observed that the size and position of the clusters remained stable. We therefore measured dynamics already at DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and studied cultures up to DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>The example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1A</xref> corresponds to a culture at DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Connections between clusters are visible as straight filaments that contain several axons.</p>
<p>We monitored spontaneous activity in the clustered network through fluorescence calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Fluorescence images of the clustered network were acquired at a rate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> frames per second, and with an image size and resolution that allowed the monitoring of all the clusters in the network with sufficient image quality (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s007">Movie S1</xref>). Activity was recorded for typically <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> hour, which provided sufficient statistics in firing events while minimizing culture degradation due to photo-damage.</p>
    <p>The analysis of the images at the end of the measurement provided the variations in fluorescence intensity for each cluster and the corresponding onset times of firing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). As shown in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, the average fluorescence signal of the network is characterized by peaks of intense cluster activity combined with silent intervals. The accompanying raster plot reveals that this activity actually corresponds to the collective ignition of a small group of clusters, which fire sequentially in a short time window on the order of few hundred milliseconds. We denote by <italic>bursts</italic> these fast sequences of clusters' activations. Young cultures (DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) exhibited an activity of about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while maturer cultures (DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) displayed about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003796-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We observed that the time spanned between two consecutively firing clusters typically ranged between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), as also observed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Tsai1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Yvon1">[48]</xref>. These times are fairly large compared to the eventual scale of signal integration-propagation between single neurons (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and is related to the large time scales associated to integration of the intra-clusters information. No consecutive activations were observed above <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, signaling the termination of a burst. We therefore use this value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a cut-off to separate a given burst form the preceding one. Then, two clusters that fired above 200 ms cannot be influenced by one another and therefore are not causally connected.</p>
<p>Bursts occurred every 30 s on average for the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and, as illustrated by the yellow bands in this figure, each burst typically encompassed a subset of clusters rather than the entire network. In general, however, the number of participating clusters within a burst depended on the details of the culture. Although in a typical experiment the collective firing comprised between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clusters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s007">Movie S1</xref>), in some experiments the entire cluster population lighted up in a single bursting episode.</p>
<p>The analysis of the onset times of firing provides the cluster's activation sequence within each burst. As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1D</xref> depicts a highly active region of the network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. This region contains <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clusters, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of them form a subset that regularly fires together. The series of frames show the progress in clusters' activation, revealed by the changes in fluorescence. Activity starts at the top-left cluster and progresses downwards. The time-line of sequence activation after image analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, and the actual fluorescence traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1F</xref>. With our <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> temporal resolution we could resolve well the propagation of activity from a cluster to its neighboring ones (black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). However, and for about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the cases, the time delay between clusters' activation was either too short for detection or activation occurred simultaneously. The clusters associated to these ‘simultaneous’ events are marked in yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, and their inter-relation was treated as a bi-directional link (yellow arrow), since no causality can be inferred.</p>
<p>A typical recording provided on the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bursting episodes. Some of them included the same group of clusters, although the precise sequence of activation could vary. An illustrative example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, which depicts the fluorescence traces of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clusters along two consecutive bursts. The first sequence corresponds to the sketch of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figure 1E</xref>. The orange box at the bottom of the plot indicates the relative activation time of each cluster within the window, with two clusters treated as simultaneous. To introduce the construction of the directed functional network that is described later, we note that, intuitively, the firing of cluster #9 is most likely caused by #8 and therefore both clusters are (functionally) strongly coupled. At the other extreme, cluster #1 most likely did not trigger #9, and therefore their mutual coupling is very weak. For the second burst, we note that the activation sequence is very similar, but the relative delay times differ, therefore modifying the cluster's coupling strengths. Indeed, cluster #1 and #9 are now functionally disconnected given their long temporal separation.</p>
<p>We carried out measurements in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> different clustered networks, and labeled them with capital letters as networks ‘A’<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>‘O’. In order to compare their properties with the ones from cultures with a distinct structure, we applied the same measuring protocols and data analysis to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cultures characterized with a homogeneous distribution of neurons (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and labeled them as networks ‘P’<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>‘U’.</p>

<title>Construction of the directed functional networks</title>
<p>The above sequences of clusters' activations, extended to all the clusters and bursting episodes of the monitored culture, convey information on the degree of causal influence between any pair of clusters in the network. For instance, cluster #5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g001">Figures 1E-F</xref> can fire because of the first order influence of clusters #3 and #4, but also because of the second and third order influences of clusters #2 and #1, respectively. Hence, a realistic functional network construction should take into account these possible influences from the upstream connected clusters to build a network whose links are not only directed, but also weighted by the time delays in activation. This weighted treatment of the interaction between clusters is the major novelty of our work and the backbone of our model.</p>
<p>More formally, the interaction between any two clusters follows the principle of causality, i.e. the firing of cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> immediately after cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> eventually implies that cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has induced the activity of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at that particular time. The likelihood of this relation between clusters is weighted according to its frequency along the full observational time, allowing to a statistical validation. Indeed, cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> could induce the activity of various clusters, if all of them activate in a physically plausible short time window after cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Such a construction is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>To construct the directed functional networks for each studied culture we proceed as follows. First of all, we divide the entire firing sequence into the bursts of clusters' activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) using the cut-off of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> introduced in the previous section. Once the bursts have been detected, we compute the frequency distribution of time lags between pairs of consecutive firings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This frequency distribution informs about the characteristic times expected between two consecutive firings within the same burst, and hence it is a good proxy of the causal influence of a cluster on another. We will use this information to weight the causal influence of firing propagation. The frequency distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> presents a good fit to a universal Gaussian decay (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in all the analyzed cultures, although the variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is specific for each culture. We indeed observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s002">Figure S2</xref>) that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreases with the culture age <italic>in vitro</italic> (correlation coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, significance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and increases with the number of clusters present in the network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>The last step in the construction of the directed functional networks consists in linking the interactions within each burst, and weighting them according to the previous frequency distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The rationale behind this process is as follows: we hypothesize that every cluster influences other clusters (posterior in time) within a burst and, the larger the time after a cluster has fired the lower the influence we expect in the activation of another cluster (simply because the signal fades out). Then, the weighting of the interaction by the expected frequency observed in the distribution conveys the functional influence between clusters. The weights are reinforced every time the same pair of clusters' sequence is observed. After processing the full sequence we obtain a peer-to-peer activation map that is our proxy of the functional network.</p>
<p>We proceeded identically to construct the directed functional networks for homogeneous cultures (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), with the only difference that the cut-off time corresponds to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We tested for both clustered and homogeneous cultures that the obtained functional networks were stable upon variations of the cut-off times (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of the functional networks</title>
<p>We computed the functional networks of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (‘A’ to ‘O’) realizations of clustered cultures, as well as the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (‘P’ to ‘U’) homogeneous ones, and analyzed some major topological traits. Firstly, for each culture we obtained the number of nodes, the number of edges, the average degree of the networks, and its average strength (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The investigated networks and their topological measures are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003796-t001">Table 1</xref>. Although young cultures display a richer activity, in general all networks present a similar number of nodes and a comparable functional connectivity, which is described by the number of edges, the average degree and the average strength.</p>
<p>Representative examples of the investigated functional networks for the clustered configuration are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g003">Figure 3</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s001">Figure S1</xref> for an example of the homogeneous ones). The position of the nodes and their size are the same as the actual clusters for easier comparison. Edges in the directed network are both color and thickness coded to highlight their importance, with darker colors corresponding to the highest weights. This representation reveals those pairs of clusters that maintain a persistent causality relationship over time. Nodes are also color coded according to their strength, i.e. the total weight of the in- and out-edges.</p>

<p>The functional networks exhibit some interesting features. First, there are groups of nodes that form tightly connected communities. These communities actually reflect the most frequent bursting sequences. Second, nodes preferentially connect to neighboring ones with some long-range connectivity, and often following paths that are not the major physical connections. This indicates that the structural connectivity of the network cannot be assessed from just an examination of the most perceivable processes. And third, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, we observed that there is no correlation between the width of the physical connections and their weight (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), or the size of the nodes and their strength (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), and indicates that the dynamical traits of the network cannot be inferred from its physical configuration, stressing the importance of the functional study.</p>
<p>We also observed that the size of the clusters did not correlate with their average activity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s004">Figure S4C</xref>), i.e. small and big clusters displayed similar firing frequencies, and of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on average. However, since some clusters are initiators of activity and others just followers, we also computed the relative contribution of a given cluster size to initiate activity in the network. We found no significant correlation between initiation and cluster size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). These results strengthen the conclusion that one cannot predict the clusters that will initiate activity, or the most persistent sequences, by just a visual inspection of cluster sizes and their distribution over the network.</p>
<p>These analyses are important in the context of the work by Shein-Idelson and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-SheinIdelson1">[41]</xref>, who studied the dynamics of <italic>isolated</italic> clusters similar to ours, and observed that their firing rate increased from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the clusters' radii escalated from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This remarkable difference in the dynamics between ‘isolated’ and ‘networked’ clusters reflects the dominant role of the network circuitry in shaping its dynamics.</p>
<p>Finally, to crosscheck that the results found for the functional networks presented here are robust to the inference method, we have also performed a classical mutual information analysis to construct functional networks for the same cultures (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The results obtained with the mutual information analysis are totally in agreement with the constructed functional networks using time delays.</p>

<title>Assortativity and rich-club properties</title>
<p>We determined the values of the weighted formulation of assortativity, both for the Pearson <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and Spearman <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> correlations, with values in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for the generalization of assortativity to directed weighted networks). Positive values of the weighted assortativity indicate that nodes with similar strength tend to connect to one another, while negative values mean the preferred interconnectivity of nodes with different strength. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003796-t001">Table 1</xref> we can observe that all clustered networks (labeled ‘A’-‘O’) exhibit a positive weighted assortativity, in the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the Pearson construction and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the Spearman one. Although the values fluctuate across different cultures, the two assortativity measures provide the same value within statistical error, and reflect that network size corrections provided by the Spearman's treatment have little influence in strongly assortative networks.</p>
<p>To assess the importance of the measured assortativity values, we have also computed the weighted rich-club <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Zlatic1">[50]</xref>. The rich-club phenomenon refers to the tendency of nodes with high degree to form tightly interconnected communities, compared to the connections that these nodes would have in a null model that preserves the node's degree but otherwise is totally random. Given the positive assortativity found, we analyzed whether this finding is also reinforced by the existence of rich-club structures.</p>
<p>The weighted formulation for the rich-club takes into account the node's strength instead of the degree, and is particularly useful in situations in which the weights of the links can not be overlooked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Serrano1">[51]</xref>. The evaluation of the rich-club <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is performed by computing the ratio between the connectivity strength of highly connected nodes and its randomized counterpart, and for gradually higher values of the strength threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The detailed calculation is described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section, and the results of the analysis for representative networks is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s005">Figure S5</xref>. Ratios larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicate that higher strength nodes are more interconnected to each other than what one would expect in a random configuration. On the contrary, a ratio less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reveals an opposite organizing principle that leads to a lack of interconnectivity among high-degree nodes. After the calculation of the ratios for all the studied clustered networks, we found a positive tendency towards the creation of rich-clubs in all of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s005">Figure S5</xref>), which is in good agreement with the observed values of assortativity.</p>
<p>The above network measures were also analyzed in experiments with a homogeneous distribution of neurons (labeled ‘P’<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>‘U’). The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003796-t001">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Network resilience</title>
<p>Several studies highlight the importance of assortative features for network resilience to damage. Given the strong assortativity of our clustered cultures, we carried out a new set of experiments to investigate the concurrent presence of resilient traits. As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, we considered two major ‘damaging’ actions to the network. In a first one, we gradually weakened the excitatory network connectivity by means of the AMPA-glutamate antagonist CNQX, and measured the decay in spontaneous activity as connectivity failed. In a second one, we continuously exposed a culture to strong fluorescence light, therefore inducing photo-damage to the neurons. This action resulted in random neuronal death across the network and hence a progressive failure of its spontaneous dynamics. The rate of activity decay upon radiation damage provided an estimation of the resistance of the network to node deletion. These investigations were carried out at the same time in clustered cultures (strongly assortative) and in homogeneous ones (weakly assortative or neutral). Their comparison provided a first reference to relate assortativity, network topology and resistance to damage.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows the results for the application of CNQX to clustered cultures. We first monitored each cluster individually in the unperturbed case, and measured its average firing activity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> along <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We then applied a given drug concentration, measured the firing activity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for another <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and computed the relative changes in activity respect to the unperturbed case, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The protocol was repeated until activity ceased. Two illustrative examples of the action of CNQX on network activity are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In a clustered cultured and for weak CNQX applications (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) the activity in some clusters increases, while in some other decreases, and on average the network firing rate remains stable (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). As [CNQX] is increased to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we observe that most of the clusters have reduced their activity, although there are still some that maintain a high activity or even increase it. This different behavior from cluster to cluster suggests that clustered networks are highly flexible, and that they may have mechanisms to preserve activity even with strong weakening of the connectivity. Conversely, homogeneous cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) lose activity in a more regular and faster way. These networks are characterized by a highly coherent dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Orlandi1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Tibau1">[37]</xref>, and therefore all neurons in the network reduce activity similarly as CNQX is applied. Interestingly, for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the shown homogeneous culture has almost completely silenced (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), while the clustered culture is still highly active.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clustered neuronal cultures have a unique self-organizing potential. An initially isotropic ensemble of individual neurons quickly group to one another to constitute a stable configuration of interconnected clusters of tightly packed neurons. The formation of the clustered network is primarily a passive process governed by the pulling forces exerted by the neurites. Interestingly, aggregation occurs even in the absence of glial cells and neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Segev1">[40]</xref>, and is maintained up to the degradation of the culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Segev1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-deSantosSierra1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Shefi1">[53]</xref>. Our work shows that this self-organizing process drives the network towards specific dynamic states, which shape a topology of the functional network that is distinctively assortative. We note that the number of clusters and their distribution are initially random. Therefore, a wide spectrum of physical circuitries and functional topologies are in principle attainable. However, in all the studied cultures, the network drives itself towards markedly assortative topologies with a ‘rich-club’ core. The emergence of these distinct topological traits, concurrently with a stronger network's resilience to activity deterioration, pictures a self-organizing mechanism that enhances network survival by procuring a robust architecture and dynamic stability.</p>
<p>We remark that the link between assortativity and resilience is based on the comparison between the response of clustered and homogeneous cultures upon the same perturbation. To obtain conclusive evidences that assortativity confers resilience traits exclusively from topology, we would require an experimental protocol in which we could arbitrarily ‘rewire’ the connectivity between clusters, or shape in a control manner different circuitries while preserving the number of nodes in the network. Although these strategies are certainly enlightening, they are of difficult development and a major experimental challenge.</p>
<p>We infer the functional connectivity maps of the clustered networks from their spontaneous dynamics. We considered small-sized networks to simultaneously access the entire population (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clusters). The approach that we have used to characterize this functional connectivity is based on the analysis of the time delays between consecutive clusters' activations. The uniqueness of our approach is to use these time delays to provide a direct measure of causality, giving rise to a functional network that is both directed and weighted, with the weights given by a decaying function that follows the frequency of the delay between pairs of clusters. Our formulation is simple and naturally derives from the intrinsic dynamics of the network.</p>
<p>We used two main parameters to quantitatively construct the directed functional network, namely the cut-off time for causality, and the variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the Gaussian-like weighting function. The cut-off time is set to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, two times the maximum measured time delay between consecutive activations. The importance of the cut-off is first to discriminate two successive bursting episodes, and second to exclude individual firing events from an actual cascade of activations. Although these individual firings account for less than 2% of the total activations, they may occur in regions of the culture that are physically distant -though temporary close- from an actual sequence, and therefore they would add spurious, long-range functional connections to the network.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is obtained from a Gaussian fit of the distribution of consecutive activation delays within bursts. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is specific for each culture to take into account particular differences in the dynamics of the network, specifically the culture days <italic>in vitro</italic> or the number of clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s002">Figure S2</xref>), parameters that could affect the delay times of activation. Young cultures for instance exhibit longer time delays between pairs of clusters, leading to a distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> shifted towards higher values and therefore a larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We tested that the obtained functional networks were stable upon variation of the above parameters. In particular, to examine whether the choice of the cut-off does or does not substantially affect the features of the generated functional network, we performed a sensitivity analysis on this parameter. As the process of generating the network from the sets of bursts is deterministic, we analyzed the influence of the cut-off value on the formed groups of firings. To quantify the variation on the bursts generated for different values of the cut-off, we calculated the variation of information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Meil1">[54]</xref> between the grouping of bursts at a certain cut-off value and the previous one as a measure to assess their difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In the case of clustered cultures, we found that for values of cut-off of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the variation of information is, on average, on the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the homogeneous case, for cut-off values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ms, this value is on the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This means that varying the cut-off values in these regions does not substantially change the grouping of the bursts, and therefore the generated networks are equivalent.</p>
<p>To assess the goodness of our construction in inferring the functional connectivity of the clustered networks, we compared our connectivity maps with those procured by information theoretic measures, such as Mutual Information or Transfer Entropy, applied to the original fluorescence recordings. These approaches have been used to draw the topological properties of neuronal networks <italic>in vitro</italic>, both in electrode recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Bettencourt1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Garofalo1">[56]</xref> and calcium fluorescence imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Stetter1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Orlandi2">[58]</xref>. The comparison of our method with these theoretic measures showed that the identified functional links were fundamentally the same, with small quantitative differences associated to the particular weighting procedures.</p>
<p>Our functional networks consistently maintained high assortativity values, and along a wide range of days <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also observed that, by contrast, the assortativity analysis in homogeneous cultures procured neutral or low assortativity values, a result that is supported by other studies in homogeneous networks similar to ours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Bettencourt1">[55]</xref>. In our study, we have seen that the clustered, assortative networks exhibit a higher resilience of the network to damage compared to the homogeneous, non-assortative ones. Different studies also highlighted the importance of assortativity and the ‘rich-club’ phenomenon on higher-order structures of the network, in particular resilience, hierarchical ordering and specialization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Sporns1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Colizza1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several studies in brain networks advocate that the functional connectivity reflects the underlying structural organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Deco1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Honey2">[61]</xref>. To shed light on this interrelation in our cultures, we would need the identification of all the physical links between clusters. The top images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g003">Figure 3</xref> indeed suggest that some structural connections could be delineated by a simple visual inspection. However, we observed by green fluorescence protein (GFP) transfection that physical connections have long extensions and may easily link several clusters together, and not just in a first-neighbor manner as seen in the images. Since the images provide a very poor subset of the entire structural layout, a complete description of the physical circuitry must be carried out before comparing the structural and functional networks. Such a detailed identification is difficult, and requires the use of a number of connectivity-labeling techniques. Nevertheless, for the connections that we could visualize, we draw two major conclusions. First, that neither the width of the physical connections nor the size of the clusters were related to a particular trait of the functional links, such as the weight of the connections or the strength of the nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003796.s004">Figure S4</xref>). And, second, that our construction inferred strong functional links between clusters that were not directly connected in a physical manner, highlighting the importance of indirect paths as well as long-range coupling in the flow of activity.</p>
<p>The identification of the full set of structural connections would certainly provide invaluable information to investigate the interplay between structure and function in our networks. In this context, the recent work by Santos-Sierra <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-deSantosSierra1">[52]</xref> is enlightening. They analyzed some major structural connectivity traits in clustered networks similar to ours, and observed that the networks were strongly assortative as well. Assortativity emerged at early stages of development, and was maintained throughout the life of the culture. Hence, in clustered cultures, the combined evidences of this study and ours hints at the existence of assortative properties in both structure and function.</p>
<p>An interesting peculiarity of our experiments is that, in most of the studied clustered cultures, the spontaneous bursting episodes comprised of a small subset of clusters rather than the entire network. This activation in the form of groups or moduli is often referred as <italic>conditional activity</italic>. It contrasts with the <italic>coherent activity</italic> of homogeneous cultures, where the entire network lights up in a short time window during a bursting episode. Given the acute differences in assortativity between clustered and homogeneous cultures, we hypothesize that the modular dynamics by itself increases or reinforces assortative traits in the functional network.</p>
<p>We finally remark that our neuronal cultures are spatial, i.e. embedded in a physical substrate, which imposes constraints to the layout of connections and, in turn, their assortative characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-deSantosSierra1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Schmeltzer1">[62]</xref>. Spatial networks have caught substantial interest in the last years to understand the restrictions—or advantages—that metric correlations impose on the structure and dynamics of complex networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Barthlemy1">[63]</xref>, in particular brain circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Bullmore2">[64]</xref>. Vértes <italic>et al</italic> showed that spatial constraints delineate several topological properties of functional brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Vrtes1">[65]</xref>, and Orlandi <italic>et al</italic> showed that the initiation mechanisms of spontaneous activity are governed by metric correlations inherited by the network during its formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Orlandi1">[36]</xref>. Strong spatial constraints in clustered networks can be attained by anchoring the neuronal aggregates in specific locations, for instance through carbon nanotubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Gabay1">[39]</xref>. The comparison of the functional maps of such a <italic>forced</italic> organization with our <italic>free</italic> one is enlightening, and would shed light on the importance of structural constraints in shaping functional connectivity.</p>
<p>To conclude, we have presented a simple yet powerful construction to draw the directed functional connectivity in clustered neuronal cultures. The construed networks present assortativity and ‘rich-club’ features, which are present concurrently with resilience traits. Our analysis has been based on spontaneous activity data, and may certainly vary from evoked activity. Hence, the combined experimental setup and functional construction can be viewed as a model system for complex networks studies, specially to understand the interplay between structure and function, and the emergence of key topological traits from network dynamics. Also, the spatial nature of our experiments may also procure invaluable data to understanding the role of short- and long-range connections in network dynamics; or to investigate the targeted deletion of the high degree nodes that shape the backbone of the network. The latter is a powerful concept that may assist in a detailed exploration of resilience in neuronal circuits, for instance to model the circuitry-activity interrelation in neurological pathologies.</p>

<p>Upon plating, the absence of adhesive proteins in the glass substrate rapidly favored cell-cell attachment and, gradually, the formation of islands of highly compact neuronal assemblies or <italic>clusters</italic> that minimized the surface contact with the substrate.

Clusters at this stage of development also anchored at the surface of the glass and, although they continued growing and developing connections, their number and position remained practically stable along the next <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> weeks.

<p>Clustered cultures were maintained for about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> weeks, as follows. At DIV <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the medium was switched from plating to <italic>changing medium</italic> (containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> FUDR, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Uridine, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> HS in enriched MEM) to limit glial cell division.

After incubation, the cultures were washed with fresh EM and placed in the observation chamber, consisting of a standard glass bottom culture dish, filled with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ml EM, and with its wall and cover screened from external light.

<p>The observation chamber was mounted on Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Orca Flash 2.8).

All experiments were carried out at room temperature.</p>
<p>The fluorescence signal of the clusters' spontaneous activity was recorded with the software Hokawo 2.5, provided by the camera vendor (Hamamatsu Photonics). We used acquisition speeds in the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> frames per second (fps), corresponding to a time interval of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e234" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between consecutive frames. These acquisition speeds were selected to optimize the balance between image quality, sufficient time resolution, and minimum light intensity. The latter was particularly important to minimize photo-damage and photo-bleaching, and allowed neuronal cultures to be studied with optimal conditions for at least 3 h. However, the combination of high acquisition speeds and high resolution images resulted in large data files—of at least <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e235" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> GB per hour of recording—that had to be stored and analyzed. We therefore limited most of our experiments to about 1 h of recording, which was sufficient to reliably build the functional networks, as described in the ‘Control experiments’ section.</p>
<p>Measurements in homogeneous cultures were carried out in the same way, with the only difference that the recording speed was increased to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e236" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>–<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e237" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fps to take into account the fast propagation of activity fronts in these preparations, as observed for instance in the study of Orlandi <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Orlandi1">[36]</xref>.</p>

<title>Resilience experiments</title>
<p>We considered two groups of resilience experiments. In a first group, we monitored the gradual degradation of network activity due to photo-damage. In a second group, we measured the decay in activity as a consequence of the gradual weakening of the excitatory connectivity.</p>
<p>In the first group of measurements, we first considered a clustered culture and measured its spontaneous activity uninterruptedly along 2 hours, with neurons continuously exposed to a light radiation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e238" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> times stronger than normal. We then divided the sequence in blocks of 30 min, and determined, for each block, the average network activity by counting the number of bursting episodes within the block. Next, we switched to a homogeneous culture from the same batch (i.e. identical nominal density and age) and carried out the same protocol. In total we carried out <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e239" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measurements for each kind of culture, and finally analyzed the decay in activity as a function of time. Although the radiation over the culture was homogeneous, the actual area occupied by the neurons was different between homogeneous and clustered cultures. Neurons in homogeneous cultures formed a monolayer that covered <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e240" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the available area, corresponding to about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> diameter wells. In clustered cultures, neurons were tightly packed in slightly three-dimensional structures, giving rise to a lower spatial coverage of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Hence, homogeneous cultures were effectively more exposed to light than their clustered counterparts. To take this spatial variability into account, the ‘total radiation’ received by the neurons in a given experiment was quantified as the duration of the light exposure times the area occupied by the neurons in the studied culture. We then averaged the results over the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> different culture realizations of each type, and binned nearby values for clarity. The comparison of the activity-radiation plots between the two networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) indicated which topology exhibited higher resistance to degradation in neuronal activity.</p>
<p>In the second group of measurements, we compared the change in activity between a clustered and a homogeneous culture during gradual weakening of neuronal connectivity. The weakening was achieved by progressive application of CNQX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Tibau1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Soriano1">[69]</xref>, an AMPA-glutamate receptor antagonist in excitatory neurons (see also ‘Pharmacology’). We first measured the clustered network and thereafter the homogeneous one. In both cases, we first recorded spontaneous activity at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and used the average firing rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as reference for the subsequent steps. We then increased the concentration of the drug to a preset value, waited <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min for the drug to take effect and measured again for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, computing the new average firing rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We switched to a second preset values, and repeated the procedure until activity ceased. The relative decay in activity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is used to illustrate the gradual fall of activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003796-g004">Figure 4C</xref>.

<title>Network connectivity weakening through CNQX</title>

For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the connectivity strength between neurons is maximum.

High CNQX concentrations lead to a complete halt in activity.

The regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen manually and typically covered an area of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pixels, each ROI corresponding to a single cluster.

At the onset of firing, the fluorescence signal increases abruptly due to the fast intake of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions.

<p>The algorithm that we used to detect the onset of firing for each cluster was as follows.

The corrected signal was then expressed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e267" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We next took <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e268" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and computed its derivative <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e269" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in order to detect fast changes in the fluorescence signal. Finally, the onset of ignition in cluster was defined as the time where a maximum in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e270" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was accompanied by values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e271" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> two times above the SD of the background signal, and for at least 5 frames.</p>

<p>In a second test, we measured spontaneous activity in a culture using identical light settings but considering different acquisition rates, namely <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e274" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fps. We then selected ignition sequences that were as similar as possible in all three measurements, and compared the results. We observed that only in the few cases where the clusters fired with strong amplitudes the increased speed enhanced detection, and again by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For the rest of the cases, the higher speeds actually worsened the analysis due to the poorer signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>Finally, in a third test, we used sub-frame resolution analysis tools to evaluate the importance of finer ignition times. Following Orlandi <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Orlandi1">[36]</xref>, we considered the approach of fitting two straight lines at the vicinity of each initially detected firing. A first fit included the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> points of the background signal that preceded ignition, and a second one extended to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e279" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> points that correspond to the fast rise in fluorescence. The crossing value of the two lines provided an onset time that refined the initially measured value. The better accuracy effectively increased the discrimination of sequences that were initially identified as simultaneous events. However, since these events are rare (by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e280" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the finer temporal resolution had practically no effect in the construction of the functional networks and the derived analysis.</p>

<p>This definition of assortativity is applicable to all kind of networks, either undirected, directed, weighted or unweighted. For weighted networks as in our case, the strength of the nodes carries important information about the structure of the network, and thus it would be useful to know the correlation between the strengths instead of the degrees. Since in this case each edge carries a weight, it seems logical that edges with higher weight should have a larger contribution to the correlation. Therefore, we define the <italic>weighted assortativity</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e317" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the Pearson weighted correlation between the strengths of the nodes. In mathematical terms, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e318" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the weight of the link from node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e319" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e320" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (zero if there is no link), then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e321" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e322" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the output and input strengths, then <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e323"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e323" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e324"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e324" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e325"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e325" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e326" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the total strength of the network, i.e. <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e327"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e327" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Litvak <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Litvak1">[31]</xref> showed that in disassortative networks the magnitude of the standard assortativity decreases with network size, a problem that was solved by replacing the Pearson correlation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e328" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the Spearman correlation, thus obtaining a <italic>Spearman assortativity</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e329" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Rich-club analysis</title>
<p>The rich-club analysis computes the degree-degree (or weight-weight) correlation distributions, and respect to a null case of non-correlated degrees (or weights). It allows us to reinforce the assortativity analysis presented before. Assortative mixing, in principle, will induce a rich-club effect that should be clearly detectable for a wide range of degrees (or weights). We will first introduce the formulation for the calculation of rich-club in weighted networks as presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Serrano1">[51]</xref>, and afterwards we will extend it to the case of weighted directed networks.</p>

The ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e345" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is calculated for all values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e346" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and ranges from the minimum value of strength in the network to the maximum. This ratio indicates the presence or absence of a rich-club in the network: a network shows a rich-club effect when the high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e347" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> give a ratio above 1.</p>
<p>To calculate this ratio on our functional networks, we have to consider that the network is not only weighted but also directed. Therefore, we need to adapt the former formulation for the case of weighted directed networks. For this reason we will consider the in- and out-strength of each node, expressed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e348" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e349" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively. In the directed formulation, Eqs. (11) and (12) remain unchanged. However, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e350" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be redefined as <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e351"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e351" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(14)</label></disp-formula>and the term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e352" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e353"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e353" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(15)</label></disp-formula>where the averages are calculated as <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e354"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e354" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(16)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>This formulation allows us to calculate the rich-club coefficient for weighted directed networks.

Therefore, in the spirit of Fraser and Swinney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003796-Fraser1">[74]</xref>, we define the time delayed mutual cross information between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e369" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e370" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003796.e371"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e371" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(18)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e372" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e373" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are indices running over some partition of the observed time series. In Eq. (18), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e374" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicates the probability to find a value of time series <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e375" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e376" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th interval, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e377" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the probability to find a value of time series <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e378" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e379" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th interval, whereas <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e380" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the joint probability to observe a firing from the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e381" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th cluster falling in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e382" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th interval and a firing from the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e383" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th cluster falling in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e384" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th interval exactly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e385" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> time frames later.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, in the following we will adopt the more concise notation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e386" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to indicate the time delayed mutual cross information. Finally, in order to gain the highest amount of information about the dynamics of cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e387" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by observing cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e388" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we consider only the maximum value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e389" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e390" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with respect to the time delay <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e391" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We estimate the importance of the observed amount of correlation by performing the above analysis on surrogate data. Surrogates adopted in this study are time series generated by randomly reshuffling the temporal observations of the firing series <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e392" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for each cluster separately. Such a procedure destroys any correlation between pairs of time series while preserving the empirical probability distribution, thus allowing to test the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is obtained by chance.</p>
<p>We indicate by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e393" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the walk corresponding to the surrogate obtained from time series <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e394" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e395" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the time delayed mutual cross information between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e396" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e397" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We perform 200 independent random realizations of surrogates for each pair <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e398" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and we estimate the corresponding expected value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e399" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the maximum mutual cross-information, as well as the root mean square <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e400" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the underlying distribution.</p>
<p>Hence, we fix <italic>a priori</italic> the significance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e401" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the hypothesis testing and we estimate the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e402" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-score corresponding to each pair <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e403" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e404" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, the observed correlation between cluster <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e405" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e406" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is said to be statistically significant if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e407" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e408" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the standard error function. Finally, we obtain the functional network of clusters by building the weight matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e409" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> whose elements are defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e410" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e411" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e412" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e413" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p><bold>Homogeneous cultures.</bold> <bold>A</bold> The seeding of neurons in cover glasses previously coated with poly-l-lysine gives rise to neuronal cultures with a quasi-homogeneous distribution of neurons. A typical circular culture <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e414" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in diameter contains about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e415" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons that can be well identified either as bright spots in the fluorescence recordings or as circular objects in bright-field images (small panel on the right). Spontaneous activity in these homogeneous cultures is typically recorded at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e416" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> frames/s, which suffices to extract the time delays between consecutive neuronal activations. The particular experiment shown here corresponds to network ‘P’ of the main text, with a total of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e417" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons manually selected over the images and monitored along <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e418" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The analysis of their spontaneous activity traces is analyzed in the context of our model, finally procuring the functional connectivity network and its topological properties. <bold>B</bold> Given the large number of nodes analyzed and the high average degree of the resulting network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e419" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> functional connections per neuron), a representation of the complete functional network is unpractical. As an example of the obtained functional networks, we here show all the functional links within a small region placed in the center containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e420" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons. Connections are both color and thickness coded according to their weight. Nodes are color coded according to their strength. <bold>C</bold> As an alternative representation, we show here a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e421" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the population (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e422" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons randomly chosen), each neuron showing the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e423" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of its links. Nodes and links are color coded according to their strength and weight, respectively. <bold>D</bold> A ring graph of the same neurons shows that most of them display a similar connectivity, in contrast to the strong modularity and variability in connectivity exhibited by the clustered cultures.</p>

<p><bold>Sensitivity of the functional network construction to the cut-off times.</bold> The cut-off determines the end of a sequence and therefore its variation modifies the set of burst chosen. The cut-off is set to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e428" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for clustered cultures and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e429" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for homogeneous ones. To assess the sensitivity of the grouping of bursts to the cut-off, we have computed the Variation of Information (VI) between the grouping of bursts at a certain cut-off value and the previous one. It is computed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e430" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e431" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e432" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are two partitions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e433" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the entropy and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e434" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the mutual information. In our case, each partition is the set of burst found at a certain value of the cut-off. We have screened the cut-off values from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e435" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e436" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The analysis shows that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e437" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for homogeneous and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e438" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for clustered cultures are values for which the variation of information is already stabilized. Thus, the modification of the cut-off within the stabilization region does not change the grouping of clusters in each burst, and therefore the derived functional networks, as well as the corresponding network measures, remain the same.</p>

The plot represents the analysis of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e439" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pairs of clusters, with data binned for similar widths. No significant correlation is observed. <bold>B</bold> The dependence of the node strength on cluster size shows no correlation, indicating that the functional connectivity cannot be assessed from the size of the clusters. Data is based on the analysis of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e440" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clusters. <bold>C</bold> For the same clusters, this plot shows that the activity of a cluster is independent of its size. <bold>D</bold> Activity within a burst is always initiated by a particular cluster, which triggers the sequential activation of all the downstream clusters. To quantify the importance of these ‘initiators of activity’ in network dynamics we computed the number of times that a cluster of a given size initiates a sequence of activations. The plot shows that there is no a significant correlation between initiation and size. The analysis is based on the study of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003796.e441" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bursts.
