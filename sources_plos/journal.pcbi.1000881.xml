<p>Many algorithms that compare protein structures can reveal similarities that suggest related biological functions, even at great evolutionary distances. Proteins with related function often exhibit differences in binding specificity, but few algorithms identify structural variations that effect specificity. To address this problem, we describe the Volumetric Analysis of Surface Properties (VASP), a novel volumetric analysis tool for the comparison of binding sites in aligned protein structures. VASP uses solid volumes to represent protein shape and the shape of surface cavities, clefts and tunnels that are defined with other methods. Our approach, inspired by techniques from constructive solid geometry, enables the isolation of volumetrically conserved and variable regions within three dimensionally superposed volumes. We applied VASP to compute a comparative volumetric analysis of the ligand binding sites formed by members of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domains and the serine proteases. Within both families, VASP isolated individual amino acids that create structural differences between ligand binding cavities that are known to influence differences in binding specificity. Also, VASP isolated cavity subregions that differ between ligand binding cavities which are essential for differences in binding specificity. As such, VASP should prove a valuable tool in the study of protein-ligand binding specificity.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Proteins carry out vital and specific functions by physically binding other molecules. Understanding specificity, the preferential binding of certain molecules to one another, is essential for numerous medical and industrial applications. Given the structure of a protein with unknown function, algorithms are available that suggest hypothetical functions based on structural similarities to better-studied proteins, even at vast evolutionary distances. In contrast, few algorithms identify structural differences that relate to differences in specificity among closely-related proteins. To address this problem, we present a Volumetric Analysis of Surface Properties (VASP). VASP differs from existing methods because it compares solid representations of protein structures and cavities based on principles from computer graphics and computer aided design. In our results, solid representations enabled VASP to isolate elements of protein structure that create differences in binding sites and thereby lead to differences in binding preferences. These observations point to applications for the annotation and engineering of protein specificity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The comparative analysis of protein structures is widely used to infer protein function. Geometric alignment of entire structures or of individual domains can reveal that two proteins are related even if this is not evident from sequence. Numerous techniques have been developed for this purpose, most based on either the superimposition of the polypeptide backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Nussinov1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Yang1">[5]</xref>, the comparison of geometric graphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Artymiuk1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Gibrat1">[7]</xref> or the alignment of a matrix of distances between individual amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Holm1">[8]</xref>. A second type of approach involves the direct comparison of functional sites, such as the geometric disposition of catalytic residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Barker1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Polacco1">[13]</xref> or the comparison of the shapes of cavities on the protein surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Binkowski1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Tseng1">[18]</xref>. Surface representations of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Connolly1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Rosen1">[24]</xref> are, in particular, widely used as they reveal shape recognition features that underlie binding specificity. Most approaches reported to date have focused on remote homology detection with the goal of identifying similarities between two or more proteins that can give hints as to biological function. However, a large class of phenomena depend on the ability of closely related proteins to bind similar but non-identical ligands. In such cases the function of a protein as normally defined is well-known but its binding preferences may not be.</p>
<p>The problem we are specifically addressing concerns the case where two or more proteins have been structurally aligned and it is of interest to identify conserved and varying regions in their binding cavities. Conserved regions, for example, might bind a molecular fragment that is common to substrates acted on by the entire protein family, while the source of differences in intrafamily specificity would likely reside in regions where cavities vary. Our approach is based on a volumetric representation of binding cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g001">Figure 1</xref>) that is generated with a new program, VASP (Volumetric Analysis of Surface Properties). VASP uses Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) to compare regions in space defined by a polyhedral boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Ju1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Voelcker1">[26]</xref>. Developed originally for the computer aided design of machine parts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Voelcker1">[26]</xref>, and adapted later for computer graphics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Ju1">[25]</xref>, CSG enables volumetric unions, intersections, and differences of two aligned regions to be computed as if they are solid objects. These CSG operations are a novel tool in the analysis of protein structures because they yield an approximation to the shape of solid regions that is varying or conserved, among protein structures and protein cavities, that is not possible with existing structure comparison methods.</p>

<p>The solid representations used in VASP differ fundamentally from point-based and surface-based representations, which are used in existing methods to define and compare cavities. Point-based representations compare the geometric coordinates of atoms related by one-to-one correspondences. These correspondences cannot be fully constructed between all atoms of sidechains with different lengths, forcing the simplification of sidechain geometry into pseudo-atom or backbone-only representations. In contrast, solid representations compare regions defined by the molecular surface, whose shape reflects the position of any atom without simplification. Solid and surface-based representations both measure differences in molecular shape and curvature. However, surface representations cannot disassemble surface cavities to isolate conserved (intersecting, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g001">Figure 1i</xref>) or varying (difference, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g001">Figure 1g, 1h</xref>) regions, as VASP does with CSG, because surface representations do not represent the interior or exterior of a boundary surface. To our knowledge, VASP is the first application of CSG to protein structure comparison, although small molecules have been previously compared in a related manner with lattice points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Stouch1">[27]</xref> and voxels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Bohacek1">[28]</xref>, which are both precursors to Marching Cubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Lorensen1">[29]</xref>, the origin of our technique. These earlier techniques use rectilinear representations that cannot approximate the curvature of molecular surfaces, as VASP does. Other volumetric methods have also been developed to capture topological differences in electrostatic isocontours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Zhang1">[30]</xref> and to represent regions where substrates overlap for the design of inhibitors that evade drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Nalam1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>The input to VASP includes the definition of binding cavities obtained from manual observation or cavity detection algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Peters1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Laskowski1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-An1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Zhang2">[36]</xref>, and structural alignments of entire proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Nussinov1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Chen2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Schmitt1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Tseng1">[18]</xref>. VASP then uses CSG comparisons of aligned cavity volumes to enable several unique capabilities. Unlike existing methods, VASP can identify individual amino acids and cavity subregions that create structural differences in ligand binding cavities that influence binding specificity. Such functionalities suggest novel applications in protein engineering and design and in the detailed characterization of the determinants of ligand binding specificity. We demonstrate VASP's capabilities with applications to the START domains and to the peptide binding cleft of serine proteases.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>VASP represents three dimensional regions with a signed field, a mathematical construct that describes every point in space as either inside, outside, or on the surface bordering a given region. We approximate the surface of these regions with Marching Cubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Lorensen1">[29]</xref>, a method first applied to visualize protein surfaces using the GRASP program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Nicholls1">[23]</xref> and also applied widely to visualize magnetic resonance imaging data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Clarke1">[37]</xref> and electron densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Heiden1">[38]</xref>. We use Marching Cubes for the comparison of protein structures and protein cavities because of its compatibility with CSG operations, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Ju1">[25]</xref>. We approximate the volume within these regions using a technique called the Surveyor's Formula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Schaer1">[39]</xref>. In addition to the descriptions below, pseudocode outlining these methods is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s012">Text S1</xref> and two optimizations for Marching Cubes are described and benchmarked in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s015">Text S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s010">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Computing CSG operations with Marching Cubes</title>
<p>As input, Marching Cubes requires the desired output resolution, which specifies how finely the output region will be approximated, the desired CSG operation, union, intersection or difference, and two closed regions A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), defined by their surface boundaries S<sub>A</sub> and S<sub>B</sub>, representing, in this work, aligned cavities.

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000881.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Using intersection as an example, the overall procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2</xref>) is to approximate the shape of the overlapping region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) shared by A and B. First, we construct an axis aligned cubic lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2b</xref>) so that, along any dimension, every triangle of A and B is within the bounds of the lattice. We interpret the lattice as a grid of “lattice points,” incrementally spaced along the primary axes according to the desired output resolution, or as a set of “lattice segments” connecting pairs of co-axial lattice points, or as a collection of identically sized “lattice cubes” sharing lattice segments. The lattice is a scaffold for generating the triangles of the output surface.</p>
<p>Second, each lattice point p is determined to be either inside or outside the overlapping region by first testing if p is inside or outside A and B, individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). We determine if p is inside A by generating a randomly oriented ray originating at p. A is not infinitely large, so the ray must eventually extend outside S<sub>A</sub>, perhaps intersecting the triangles of S<sub>A</sub> several times. Beginning from the outside, we count these intersections backwards along the ray, crossing into and out of A each time the ray passes through S<sub>A</sub>. Therefore, for an even number of intersections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2c1</xref>), p is outside A. For an odd number of intersections, p is inside A. We apply the same even/odd method to test if p is inside B. If p is inside A and p is inside B, then p must be inside the overlapping region, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2c2</xref>. Otherwise, p must be outside the overlapping region.</p>
<p>The third step begins by selecting lattice segments that connect a lattice point inside the overlapping region to a lattice point outside the overlapping region, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2e</xref>. Since the overlapping region of two closed regions must be closed, all selected segments necessarily exit the overlapping region at a “crossing point” p<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2g</xref>) where the selected segment intersects S<sub>A</sub> or S<sub>B</sub> or both. If only one of S<sub>A</sub> and S<sub>B</sub> intersect the selected segment, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2f1</xref>, or if S<sub>A</sub> and S<sub>B</sub> intersect at the same point, then p<sub>0</sub> is that point of intersection. If S<sub>A</sub> and S<sub>B</sub> intersect the selected segment at different points, we call these points p<sub>A</sub> and p<sub>B</sub>. If p<sub>A</sub> is inside B, then p<sub>A</sub> is on the border of A but still inside B, so p<sub>A</sub> must be at the border of the overlapping region, and thus p<sub>0</sub> = p<sub>A</sub>. Conversely, if p<sub>B</sub> is inside A, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2f2</xref>, then, for the same reasons, p<sub>0</sub> = p<sub>B</sub>.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyze each lattice cube. For each cube, there are 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 possibilities for the interior/exterior state of its 8 lattice points. Each state corresponds to a unique way for one or more parts of the output surface to pass through the lattice cube, leaving some combination of the lattice points inside or outside the overlapping region. The crossing points indicate precisely where the border of the overlapping region intersects with the lattice segments of the cube. All that remains is to connect the crossing points with triangles to approximate the border of the overlapping region inside the cube, as shown with four examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2h</xref>. Since there exists 256 different triangular configurations, a lookup table, described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Lorensen1">[29]</xref>, provides a triangular configuration for every possibility. Notably, the triangles have a directional orientation, defined to face away from the interior of the surface. To denote the orientation of a triangle, a fact we use later, the corners are enumerated in counterclockwise order, when viewed from an exterior perspective. These “output triangles” are depicted as black dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2i</xref>, since the figure is two dimensional. The output triangles approximate the border of the overlapping region, but are not necessarily identical to the triangles of either S<sub>A</sub> or S<sub>B</sub>. Proper selection of the output resolution can reduce inaccuracies in the output surface. The final output region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g002">Figure 2j</xref>) is within the surface composed by the output triangles.</p>

<title>Approximating interior volume using the Surveyor's Formula</title>
<p>As input, we begin with a closed region A represented by a boundary surface S<sub>A</sub> composed of oriented triangles. From the input, we compute the centroid c of all triangle corners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). Looping through each triangle t in S<sub>A</sub>, we keep a running total, V, initially zero, of the volume within S<sub>A</sub>, while performing the subroutine below. After all triangles have been considered, the final value of V is the volume within S<sub>A</sub>.</p>

<p>First, we compute the centroid of the triangle, t<sub>c</sub>, and the normal vector of the triangle, t<sub>n</sub>. t<sub>n</sub> is perpendicular to the plane of t, but for any plane, there are two perpendicular directions. Using the fact that t is oriented, we select t<sub>n</sub> to point away from the inside of S<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). Second, we determine if t faces away from c or towards c, by measuring the dot product d between t<sub>n</sub> and the vector (t<sub>c</sub>-c) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). Next, we generate the tetrahedron T, with corners based on the three corners of t, and the global centroid c. We measure the volume of T, v(T), using Tartaglia's rule, described below. If d is positive, we add v(T) to V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g003">Figure 3d</xref>), if d is negative, we subtract v(T) from V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g003">Figure 3e</xref>). If d is zero, v(T) is also zero, in which case we do nothing and proceed to the next triangle.</p>

SCREEN produces lists of amino acids nearby the cavity, which we convert into a volumetric representation using the procedure illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4</xref>: First, GRASP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Petrey1">[3]</xref> is used to compute triangular meshes approximating the molecular surface based on a 1.4 Å probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4a</xref>), and an “envelope” surface based on a 5.0 Å probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). Second, all patches of triangles on the molecular surface with corners further than 2 Å from any location on the envelope surface are identified as the base of each surface cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4c</xref>). Third, the patch closest to the amino acids produced by SCREEN is manually selected for the analysis that follows. Fourth, for every triangle in the selected patch, the closest atom in the structure is found and the amino acid it belongs to is added to a non-redundant list. This list contains all amino acids lining the selected patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4d</xref>). Fifth, the qhull program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Barber1">[42]</xref>, is used to compute the convex hull of the Van der Waals spheres of the amino acids lining the selected patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4e</xref>). From the region within the convex hull, the region within the molecular surface is removed using the CSG difference operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4f</xref>), as is the region outside the envelope surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4g</xref>). The resulting region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4h</xref>) defines the cavity. Occasionally, small disconnected regions are created in this process. All but the largest, based on surface area, are removed.</p>

<p>CSG can also be used to define a subsite of a cavity. First, we follow the procedure described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4</xref> to represent the entire cavity. Second, we position spheres in the subsite of interest based on the coordinates of bound ligands and select a radius for each sphere that is large enough to overlap the entire subsite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4i</xref>). Third, we compute the CSG union of all the spheres. Fourth, we calculate the intersection between the sphere union and the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g004">Figure 4j</xref>). The resulting region defines the shape of the subsite, without including the wider cavity.</p>

<title>Identifying amino acids that influence cavity shape</title>
<p>We begin with aligned proteins X and Y, with cavities x and y. First, we generate the molecular surface S<sub>a</sub> of each amino acid a in X, individually. Second, we compute the CSG intersection between a and y, and measure the volume of the intersection using the Surveyor's Formula. Amino acids with a nonzero volume of intersection cause x to have a different shape than y.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">
<title>Identifying volumetrically conserved and varying regions</title>
<p>Regions conserved among aligned cavities are determined by repeated application of CSG intersection. Regions occupied by at least one cavity, among several, are determined with the CSG union. Regions in a cavity x that are not in a cavity y are determined with the CSG difference. For example, the region conserved in all trypsin cavities that overlaps no elastase cavity, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g009">Figure 9d</xref>, is evaluated as the difference between the intersection of all trypsin cavities and the union of all elastase cavities.</p>

<title>Protein data sets</title>
<p>The Protein DataBank (PDB - 06.15.2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Berman1">[48]</xref> contains the structures of 28 START domains and 582 serine proteases, from the chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase subfamilies. From each set, we removed functionally undocumented and mutant structures and then structures with greater than 90% sequence identity, leaving a non-redundant subset of 11 START domains and 14 serine proteases. Filtering in this order maximized the number of diverse representative structures, identifying START domains and serine proteases averaging 12% and 47% pairwise sequence identity, respectively. Hydrogen atoms, resolved in only four structures in our dataset, were removed for consistency.</p>
<p>The START domains are lipid transporters whose available structures belong to distinct subgroups that have well documented ligand binding specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Alpy1">[49]</xref>. Three proteins in our set exhibit a specific affinity for cholesterols: MLN64 (pdb: 1em2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Tsujishita1">[50]</xref>, StarD5 (pdb: 2r55) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Alpy1">[49]</xref>, and StarD4 (pdb: 1jss) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Romanowski1">[51]</xref>.

These proteins include allergen-like proteins from birch (pdb: 1bv1), cherry (pdb: 1e09), celery (pdb: 2bk0), yellow lupine (pdb: 1xdf), and mung bean (pdb: 2flh).

<title>Structure alignment and cavity preparation</title>
<p>Using Ska <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Yang1">[5]</xref>, the START domains were aligned to the major birch allergen (pdb: 1bv1), which was selected randomly. Cavities were defined in the START domains as described above, without subsite definition. The serine proteases were aligned via Ska to bovine gamma-chymotrypsin (pdb: 8gch), because 8gch exhibits a tryptophan bound in the S1 specificity pocket of the larger peptide binding cleft. The S1 pocket was defined with the subsite technique described above. 5 Å spheres were positioned at all tryptophan atoms and at five waters at the bottom of the 8gch S1 pocket. With all S1 pockets aligned onto the S1 pocket of 8gch, the spheres defined the S1 subsite cavity in all serine proteases. Manually placed waters can also be used to define known subsites, but bound waters and substrate provided an objectively defined subsite for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>Structural alignments of all proteins in our datasets to an individual structure did not create bias in our results.

<title>Implementation and performance details</title>
<p>VASP was developed in ANSI C/C++ and compiled on gcc 3.4.6, for 32 and 64 bit ×86 computing platforms. Visualization was implemented using the OpenGL C/C++ library on Windows XP platforms running Intel Xeon, AMD Athlon 64, and Nvidia Geforce 6800 and 7600 chipsets. Experimentation was performed on quad-core Opteron systems with at least 2 gigabytes of random access memory per core. VASP, a single threaded process, used one core and approximately 1 gigabyte of RAM. All results were computed at .5 Å resolution, which produced accurate results with practical runtimes:</p>
<p>CSG operations converting a known functional site into a volumetric representation involved the entire protein structure, and an average of 1.04 million voxels, 384,461 triangles, and 12.8 minutes (1355 voxels/sec). CSG operations computing the intersection of cavities, rather than whole structures, involved an average of 177,490 voxels, 59,677 triangles, and 5.9 minutes of computation (494 voxels/sec). Finally, CSG operations for individual amino acids involved an average of 2,958 voxels, 2,915 triangles, and 2.77 seconds (1068 voxels/sec). START domain cavities generally had much larger volume than serine protease cavities, and CSG runtimes reflected these differences. Additional runtime details are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s011">Table S2</xref>.</p>
<p>To further clarify the runtime performance of VASP, in the Supporting Materials, we have provided additional performance details describing the runtime of typical CSG operations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s014">Text S3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and the runtime/accuracy tradeoff at lower resolutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s014">Text S3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s006">S6</xref>). These observations suggest that .75 Å resolution can also yield reasonable accuracy, though the clustering of START domains was slightly less accurate at this resolution. In the future, adaptive approaches, using oct-trees instead of uniform voxels, and more efficient strategies for assessing the interior/exterior state of a given point, such as those described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Ju2">[44]</xref>, could potentially reduce runtimes and memory usage while maintaining accuracy.</p>

<title>START domains</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g005">Figure 5</xref> reports a clustering of START domains based on volumetric distance. It is evident that the tree separates the 11 proteins into distinct groups that are well correlated with their binding preferences. This separation indicates that VASP is successful in capturing cavity shape similarities and differences among the different proteins that relate to binding preferences. The single outlier in the tree is yellow lupine PR-10 (pdb 1xdf) which is not grouped with other broad specificity START domains. However, 1xdf has a kinked C-terminal helix that fills the ligand binding site and indeed the protein cannot bind ligands in this conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Pasternak1">[56]</xref>. Thus, volume-based classification correctly discriminates between 1xdf and the other broad-specificity START domains. It should be noted that global sequence and structure alignment also separated START domains into the correct clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000881.s007">Figure S7</xref>), but in these cases, 1xdf was included as part of the broad specificity cluster. Thus, global comparisons failed to detect a local change of cavity shape in the binding cavity.</p>

<p>We used VASP to identify the regions of the protein responsible for the unusual binding properties of 1xdf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g006">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the degree of volumetric intersection between individual amino acids in 1xdf and the cavities of the other broad-specificity START domains, 1bv1, 1e09, 2bk0, and 2flh. For most amino acids, the volume of intersection averaged 8 Å<sup>3</sup> (standard deviation 16 Å<sup>3</sup>) over all cavities. That so many amino acids have at least a small degree of overlap is due to the fact that all of these proteins have a very large internal cavity that has some degree of contact with almost every residue. In contrast to this baseline variation, residues 137–144 exhibited unusually high intersection volumes with all cavities considered, averaging 60 Å<sup>3</sup>, with several surpassing 100 Å<sup>3</sup>. These residues are located at the center of the kinked C-terminal helix that fills the binding site of 1xdf and prevents ligand binding (inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our ability to identify these residues illustrates how VASP can be used to identify locations in a structure that are responsible for specificity.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g009">Figure 9</xref> illustrates several regions within the serine protease S1 cavities that are volumetrically conserved or varying. The first region, where all S1 subsites in our dataset overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g009">Figure 9a</xref>) occupies a volume of 107 Å<sup>3</sup> and is located at the entrance of the S1 subsite. This global intersection includes a protruding region that extends into the center of the oxyanion hole, a tiny cleft critical for stabilizing hydrolysis reaction intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Robertus1">[64]</xref>. Only the central portion of the oxyanion hole was conserved among all serine proteases because of slight variations in structural alignments. It is clear that in any serine protease, if any region of the global intersection is obstructed, either P1 would be hindered in entering the S1 cavity or the oxyanion hole would be unable to stabilize reaction intermediates. By determining the global intersection of all S1 cavities, VASP can thus identify functionally significant subregions.</p>

<p>The second region we studied, a 198 Å<sup>3</sup> volume where all trypsin cavities overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g009">Figure 9b</xref>) exhibits a distinct 70 Å<sup>3</sup> protrusion that does not overlap with the region occupied by any elastase cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g009">Figure 9c</xref>). This conserved cavity protrusion accommodates the longer sidechains bound by trypsin S1 pockets that are occluded by elastase S1 pockets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000881-g009">Figure 9d</xref> illustrates one example where the peptide Gly-Ala-Arg, bound to Fusarium oxysporum (pdb: 1fn8), clearly extends its Arginine sidechain into the conserved cavity protrusion. By computing the volumetric difference between the intersection of all trypsins and the union of all elastases, VASP can identify conserved variations between subfamilies of serine proteases that influence specificity for different ligands.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have presented a new volumetric method for the comparison of protein cavities that is embodied in the VASP program. To our knowledge, VASP is the first program capable of comparing cavities via CSG and it therefore enables a new approach to the characterization of protein binding sites. We demonstrate in an application to START domains that VASP is capable of reproducing known ligand binding specificities and of identifying differences in cavity shapes among proteins that, based on global sequence or structure similarity, might have been expected to be similar. Such differences can result from variations in backbone or sidechain conformation, which are two factors contributing to subtle changes in the shape of binding cavities that would otherwise be hard to detect.</p>
<p>We demonstrate a number of applications of VASP that are not possible with existing methods. One involves the identification of amino acids that contribute to differences in cavity shape. We identified several such amino acids among the START domains and serine proteases and, in each case, reproduced known determinants of ligand binding. A second application is the identification of conserved and varying regions in protein cavities. Among the S1 subsites of the serine proteases, VASP identified conserved regions that are critical for ligand binding, and varying regions that selectively accommodate certain ligands. Overall, we find that VASP creates new opportunities to comparatively analyze and isolate the structural influence of individual elements within protein cavities.</p>
<p>As a first step in the comparison of protein and cavity shape via CSG, VASP exhibits considerable potential for broader applications. When applying VASP more broadly, input structure alignments could include local structure alignments, which would enable proteins with different folds but similar functional sites to enter the analysis. Likewise, as VASP is not a cavity detection algorithm, methods for converting the wide range of cavities detected by existing methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Peters1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Laskowski1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-An1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000881-Nayal1">[35]</xref> into a volumetric representation could allow a broader space of input to be analyzed.</p>
<p>VASP has useful applications in contexts where existing protein structure comparison techniques have not been applied. For example, efforts to engineer proteins with altered binding specificities face the practical challenge of being able to test only a few mutants from a combinatorial space of possibilities. By identifying amino acids that influence differences in cavity shape, VASP can suggest a set of mutations to consider. Another possible application is for the annotation of ligand binding specificity on function annotation servers: Given a query protein, function annotation servers can find neighbor proteins with global structure similar to the query. Using VASP, neighbors with bound ligands can be analyzed locally, at their binding sites, to assess volumetric similarity with a known or predicted binding site on the query. Patterns of local volumetric similarity and variation between the query and neighbor might correlate with patterns of ligand binding preferences. Together with other sources of information, volumetric comparison of structurally aligned proteins may thus offer an important tool in protein engineering and function annotation.</p>
