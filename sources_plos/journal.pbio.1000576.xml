<p>GTPases of the mouse IRG protein family, mediators of resistance against <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in the mouse, are inactivated by a polymorphic kinase of the parasite, resulting in enhanced parasite virulence.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Virulence of complex pathogens in mammals is generally determined by multiple components of the pathogen interacting with the functional complexity and multiple layering of the mammalian immune system. It is most unusual for the resistance of a mammalian host to be overcome by the defeat of a single defence mechanism. In this study we uncover and analyse just such a case at the molecular level, involving the widespread intracellular protozoan pathogen <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and one of its most important natural hosts, the house mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). Natural polymorphism in virulence of Eurasian <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains for mice has been correlated in genetic screens with the expression of polymorphic rhoptry kinases (ROP kinases) secreted into the host cell during infection. We show that the molecular targets of the virulent allelic form of ROP18 kinase are members of a family of cellular GTPases, the interferon-inducible IRG (immunity-related GTPase) proteins, known from earlier work to be essential resistance factors in mice against avirulent strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain ROP18 kinase phosphorylates several mouse IRG proteins. We show that the parasite kinase phosphorylates host Irga6 at two threonines in the nucleotide-binding domain, biochemically inactivating the GTPase and inhibiting its accumulation and action at the <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Our analysis identifies the conformationally active switch I region of the GTP-binding site as an Achilles' heel of the IRG protein pathogen-resistance mechanism. The polymorphism of ROP18 in natural <italic>T. gondii</italic> populations indicates the existence of a dynamic, rapidly evolving ecological relationship between parasite virulence factors and host resistance factors. This system should be unusually fruitful for analysis at both ecological and molecular levels since both <italic>T. gondii</italic> and the mouse are widespread and abundant in the wild and are well-established model species with excellent analytical tools available.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many pathogens manipulate the immune system of their hosts to facilitate infection and ensure transmission to subsequent hosts. The intracellular protozoan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, a relative of the malaria parasite, is able to infect and persist in a remarkable variety of warm-blooded hosts. Indeed roughly a third of the human race carry live <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cysts in their brains with no overt effects. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection is kept at bay in many mammals (but not in humans) by a resistance system based on a family of proteins known as the immunity-related GTPase (IRG) family. IRG proteins accumulate in infected cells on the vacuoles containing the parasite and ultimately destroy them. In this paper, we show that, in the mouse, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can oppose the IRG system by secreting an enzyme called ROP18 into infected cells, which phosphorylates key amino acids on the IRG proteins, rendering them inactive. Not all strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can produce an active form of ROP18, but those strains that do are more virulent. We propose that individual hosts control <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> with differing efficiency, and the variation we see in ROP18 kinase activity produced by different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains is an evolutionary response to this. Thus, in different mammalian hosts, each strain seeks a balance between an excess of virulence (resulting in premature death of the host) and resistance that is too efficient (resulting in clearance of the parasite and sterile immunity).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an intracellular protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle and is distantly related to the malarial genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. The sexual phase occurs only in the true cats (Felidae), while all warm-blooded animals including humans can be intermediate hosts. The infection is transmitted from cats to intermediate hosts via ingestion of oocysts from the faeces of infected cats, and from intermediate hosts back to cats by carnivory. Typically, <italic>T. gondii</italic> establishes a lifelong chronic infection in intermediate hosts by encysting, after an initial phase of rapid intracellular proliferation and cell–cell spread, in brain and muscle. The life cycle is completed when the infected host is eaten by a cat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Dubey1">[1]</xref>. However, some <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains are highly virulent for mice, killing the host as early as ten days after initial infection. Of the three clonal lineages of <italic>T. gondii</italic> commonly found in Eurasia and North America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Howe1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Sibley1">[3]</xref>, the type I strains are highly virulent for mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Sibley2">[4]</xref>. In a genetic cross between a type I virulent and a type III avirulent strain, the serine-threonine kinase secreted from rhoptry organelles, ROP18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-ElHajj1">[5]</xref>, emerged as a major virulence factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Taylor1">[6]</xref>. In another genetic cross, ROP16 kinase and the ROP5 pseudokinases were implicated in virulence differences between type II and type III strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Saeij1">[7]</xref>. Comparative studies of ROP18 from multiple <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains, including the major Eurasian types, established that this virulence protein shows extensive polymorphic sequence variation derived from recent episodes of positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khan1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>In mice the major resistance factors preventing acute death from avirulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, and thereby allowing <italic>T. gondii</italic> transmission, are large GTPases of the immunity-related GTPase (IRG) family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Taylor2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-KnenWaisman1">[10]</xref>. These interferon-γ (IFNγ)-inducible proteins accumulate on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) within minutes after infection of a cell by an avirulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Martens1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khaminets1">[12]</xref>. The PVM becomes vesiculated then disrupted, and the parasite is killed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Martens1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Ling1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao1">[14]</xref>. Encoded by about 15 active genes in the C57BL/6 mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Bekpen1">[15]</xref> and unpublished results), the IRG proteins function interactively and nonredundantly in resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Hunn1">[16]</xref>, so that disruption of single members of the family cause highly significant early mortality following infection with avirulent strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Taylor2">[9]</xref>. However, during infection by a type I virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain, few vacuoles accumulate IRG proteins in large amounts or disrupt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khaminets1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao3">[18]</xref>, and parasite replication in cells is not inhibited by IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao2">[17]</xref>. These parallel observations on parasite virulence and host resistance suggested that IRG proteins might be phosphorylated and inactivated by ROP kinases from virulent strain <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>
<p>The switch I and switch II loops of the GTP-binding domain of GTPases are sequence elements whose conformational changes during the GTP-binding and hydrolysis cycle largely determine the functional activity of the protein via its interaction with other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Vetter1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Milburn1">[20]</xref>. In classical Ras-like small GTPases the switch I loop contains a conserved threonine (the “G2 threonine”) interacting with a catalytically important Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. In Irga6, the only IRG protein for which structural <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Ghosh1">[21]</xref>, biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Uthaiah1">[22]</xref> and Pawlowski et al., unpublished data), and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Martens1">[11]</xref> and Liesenfeld et al., unpublished data) information is available, highly conserved threonines are present in the switch I loop, but the typical Ras configuration is not seen and these residues do not coordinate the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Ghosh1">[21]</xref>. We show here that the ROP18 kinase from highly virulent strains targets Irga6, phosphorylating two threonines in the switch I loop. For Irga6, the switch I loop from residues 100 to 109 is implicated in the formation of a critical dimer interface with a neighbouring Irga6 molecule during the process of GTP-dependent activation and subsequent hydrolysis (Pawlowski et al., unpublished data). We present evidence that phosphorylation of either of the target threonines inactivates the GTPase and inhibits its normal accumulation on the PVM. Virulent strains also phosphorylate other IRG resistance proteins, and other ROP kinase homologues have been associated with virulence, suggesting that this will prove to be a general mechanism by which <italic>T. gondii</italic> moderates the IRG system, thus favouring long-term survival of both parasite and host.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We looked directly for phosphorylation of the mouse IRG protein Irga6, which we immunoprecipitated from <italic>T. gondii</italic>-infected fibroblasts. IFNγ-induced fibroblasts were labelled in parallel with <sup>33</sup>P-phosphoric acid or <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine and infected with the virulent type I RH-YFP strain <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A single phosphorylated protein was immunoprecipitated corresponding to the upper band of a doublet metabolically labelled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine, and found only in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The single phosphorylated band was found only in immunoprecipitates from virulent strain infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, type I strains RH-YFP and BK). The <sup>33</sup>P-labelled band is not due to another protein coprecipitated with Irga6 since it could also be detected by Western blot with monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents specific for Irga6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and unpublished data). Irga6 is a myristoylated protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Martens2">[23]</xref>, and nonmyristoylated Irga6 also runs slightly slower than native myristoylated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Papic1">[24]</xref> and unpublished data). However, both Irga6 bands in immunoprecipitates from the virulent strain infections incorporated <sup>3</sup>H-myristic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), and are therefore myristoylated. Thus, infection by virulent strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, but not by avirulent strains, results in significant phosphorylation of native, myristoylated Irga6.</p>

<title>Irga6 is phosphorylated by type I virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</title>
<p>(A) A novel phosphorylated Irga6 band (black arrowhead) was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-Irga6 antibody, 10E7, from RH-YFP-infected, IFNγ-induced mouse L929 cells metabolically labelled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine or <sup>33</sup>P-phosphoric acid. Nonphosphorylated Irga6 is indicated with an open arrowhead. The figure is a montage from two segments of a single autoradiogram, joined as indicated by black vertical line. (B) Only virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains phosphorylate Irga6. MEFs were induced with IFNγ, infected with virulent type I and avirulent type II and type III strains, and labelled with <sup>33</sup>P-phosphoric acid. A single phosphorylated band (black arrowhead) was immunoprecipitated with 10E7 only from cells infected with type I strains. The figure is a montage of segments from several autoradiograms, joined as indicated by the black vertical lines. Phosphorylated Irga6 from cells infected with RH-YFP served as positive control for all segments (not shown). (C) The electrophoretically more slowly migrating phosphorylated band (black arrowhead), immunoprecipitated with anti-Irga6 165 antiserum from IFNγ-induced L929 cells infected with virulent strain RH-YFP, is Irga6 and not a coprecipitated protein (Western blot with 10E7). Only the faster band of Irga6 is immunoprecipitated from cells infected with avirulent ME49 strain (open arrowhead). (D) Both Irga6 bands were immunoprecipitated with 10E7 from RH-YFP-infected IFNγ-induced L929 cells labelled with <sup>3</sup>H-myristic acid (autoradiogram). In the absence of infection only the lower myristoylated band is seen. Black arrowhead: myristoylated phosphorylated Irga6 (myr-(p)Irga6). Open arrowhead: myristoylated Irga6 (myr-Irga6).</p>

<p>The phosphorylated sites on Irga6 were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the phosphorylated Irga6 band immunoprecipitated from IFNγ-induced fibroblasts infected with RH-YFP. Tryptic peptides were found corresponding in mass to phosphorylated derivatives of a region of the switch I loop of the nucleotide binding domain containing two closely-spaced threonines, T102 and T108 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Putatively phosphorylated peptides containing both target threonines, corresponded in molecular mass exclusively to monophosphorylated derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To confirm the phosphorylation of the two minimal peptides, the candidates were further resolved by CID (collision-induced dissociation) MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000576.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) MALDI-TOF spectra of tryptic digests of immunoprecipitated phosphorylated (upper profile) and nonphosphorylated (lower profile) Irga6 from IFNγ-induced, RH-infected MEFs. The partial spectra on the left are focused on the m/z 2176.1, corresponding to the nonphosphorylated tryptic Irga6 peptide G<sup>91</sup>IGNEEEGAAKTGVVEVTMER<sup>111</sup>. The partial spectra to the right are focused on m/z 2256.0, corresponding to the same peptide monophosphorylated on either T102 or T108. The isotopic pattern of m/z 2256.0 in the phosphorylated material is partially overlaid by a pattern of unknown identity at m/z 2259.1. (B) The switch I region (green) occurs in different configurations in Irga6 crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Ghosh1">[21]</xref> (ribbon presentation). T102 and T108 are labelled in red. In PDB structure 1TQ6, T108 is turned outwards while T102 points towards the nucleotide. In PDB 1TQ2B, T108 is turned inwards, pointing towards the γ-phosphate, while T102 is rotated away from the nucleotide (GppNHp in stick format; grey sphere: Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion).

There is to date no evidence for a protein product from <italic>Irga1</italic>, <italic>Irga2</italic>, and <italic>Irga8</italic> (indicated by *), while eight of the <italic>IRGB</italic> units are expressed in the form of four head-to-tail tandem proteins (b2-b1, b5-b4, b5<sup>*</sup>-b3, and b9-b8), indicated by brackets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Bekpen1">[15]</xref> and unpublished data).

The switch I region is indicated below the alignment. The T108 residue of Irga6 is absolutely conserved in the other IRG proteins, while the T102 of Irga6 is largely conserved (green boxes).

<p>Among the crystal structures available for Irga6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Ghosh1">[21]</xref>, T102 and T108 are found in several different configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In one structure (Protein Data Bank [PDB] 1TQ6), the side chain of T102 is close to the nucleotide, while the side chain of T108 is distant from the nucleotide and largely exposed to solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, left graphic). In another (PDB 1TQ2B), T108 is oriented towards the nucleotide, while T102 is rotated away from the nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, right graphic). The alternation between the two structures correlates with the presence or absence of a short helical turn in the switch I loop. Phosphorylation of one threonine may lock one configuration for the switch I loop, preventing kinase access to the second threonine. Unlike the classical G2 threonine of many small GTPases, neither T102 nor T108 interacts with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in any Irga6 structure so far studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Ghosh1">[21]</xref>. T108 is absolutely conserved among all the IRG proteins, while T102 is highly but not completely conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>That T102 and T108 are targets of phosphorylation by virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains in infected cells was confirmed by Western blot of <italic>T. gondii</italic>-infected, IFNγ-induced cells with two rabbit antisera raised respectively against peptides of Irga6 containing phospho-T102 and phospho-T108. After affinity purification both antibodies identified a single band in IFNγ-induced wild-type (wt) fibroblasts infected with virulent RH-YFP strain <italic>T. gondii</italic>. This band was not found in uninduced, infected fibroblasts nor in induced, uninfected fibroblasts. Most significantly, it was also not found in IFNγ-induced fibroblasts infected with the avirulent strains ME49 (type II) and CTG (type III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>To examine the probable impact of phosphorylation at the two target threonines we assayed the functional properties of two sets of bacterially expressed mutant Irga6 proteins: (1) negatively charged, phosphomimetic aspartic acid mutants T102D, T108D and the double mutant T102/108D and (2) neutral alanine mutants T102A, T108A and T102/108A, compared with the wt Irga6 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Uthaiah1">[22]</xref>. All the T102 and T108 mutations, whether phosphomimetic or neutral, essentially abolished GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>) and strongly inhibited GTP-dependent oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). The affinities of all the Thr to Ala mutants were in the wt range for both GTP and GDP, while the affinities of the T102D and T102/108D mutants for GDP were about an order of magnitude lower than wt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000576.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>For further functional analysis, we expressed the six mutant proteins and wt Irga6, tagged at the C terminus, by transfection in IFNγ-induced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with the avirulent ME49 strain <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The proportion of vacuoles detectably loaded with the mutant Irga6 proteins was in all cases lower than the values for the tagged wt Irga6 (shown for the phosphomimetic Thr to Asp mutants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), though in no case eliminated. The amount of the mutant Irga6 proteins accumulated onto individual loaded vacuoles was, however, greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, the mutant proteins had a weak but consistent dominant negative action on the accumulation of wt Irga6 on the PVM, perhaps by interference with homomeric or heteromeric oligomerisation of active Irga6 protein at the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This could contribute to the biological effect of the kinase even if not all target IRG molecules are phosphorylated. In conclusion, Irga6 mutated at T102 or T108 is inactive biochemically, is impaired in access to the PVM compared with wt protein, and inhibits to some degree the loading of wt Irga6 onto the PVM. The fact that the Thr to Ala mutants were essentially as impaired as the phosphomimetic Thr to Asp mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g005">5</xref>; unpublished data) indicates that phosphorylation acts by interfering with the function of two essential threonines in the switch I region of Irga6, rather than through some active property conferred by the additional negative charge or of the phosphate group itself.</p>

<p>ROP18 is an active <italic>T. gondii</italic> kinase that occurs in different allelic forms in the three Eurasian and North American clonal lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khan1">[8]</xref>. The protein is secreted directly from apical secretory organelles (rhoptries) into the cytosol locally at the site of cell invasion, and it accumulates on the cytosolic face of the PVM of the invading organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-ElHajj1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Boothroyd1">[25]</xref>. It is thus well-placed to interfere with the accumulation of IRG proteins on the PVM. If ROP18 is responsible for the phosphorylation of Irga6 in vivo, this property should be conferred on a type III avirulent strain (CTG) transgenic for expression of active ROP18 from the virulent type I strain, GT-1, which is identical to RH strain ROP18 in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-ElHajj1">[5]</xref> and TGGT1_063760 on ToxoDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://toxodb.org" xlink:type="simple">http://toxodb.org</ext-link>).

Strong immunofluorescent staining by anti-pT102 and anti-pT108 antibodies was seen on vacuoles from the active ROP18 transgenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The great majority of CTG V1 vacuoles were stained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, red), while few vacuoles of the kinase-dead ROP18 (CTG L1, green) and vector only (CTG Ble, black) transgenic <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains were stained. Furthermore, the intensity of staining of the phosphothreonine antibodies was also strikingly higher on the CTG V1 vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g008">Figure 8B and 8C</xref>). No staining of the anti-phosphothreonine antibodies was detected on any of the transgenic CTG strain vacuoles in cells not induced with IFNγ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000576.s004">Figure S4</xref>). However, significant but weak staining with anti-pT108 antibody was seen on the vacuoles of the CTG strains transgenic for the empty vector and for the kinase-dead ROP18 in IFNγ-induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), echoing the weak staining of ME49 vacuoles by anti-pT108 antibody already noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g006">Figure 6</xref>. That phosphorylation of Irga6 by virulent ROP18 interferes with Irga6 function, already hinted at by the weak dominant negative effect of the Thr to Asp phosphomimetic mutant proteins shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, is reflected in a drop in the overall intensity of Irga6 on the vacuoles of cells infected with the CTG V1 strain relative to the staining seen with the two control strains especially at low IFNγ concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). We consider it likely that phosphorylation of Irga6 by virulent ROP18 occurs at the vacuole, and that the reduced loading observed is due to destabilization of interactions between IRG molecules and possibly also to conformational changes affecting the positioning of the myristoyl group required for vacuolar association of Irga6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Papic1">[24]</xref> and unpublished data).</p>

<p>The data presented above showed that the presence of virulent strain ROP18 is required for in vivo phosphorylation of T102 and T108 of Irga6, but did not show a direct interaction between ROP18 and Irga6. A direct interaction could, however, be shown in a yeast two-hybrid assay between both wt and kinase-dead ROP18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000576.s005">Figure S5</xref>). To demonstrate that type I ROP18 is in fact an Irga6 kinase with the appropriate specificity, we coincubated bacterially derived purified full-length mature GST-ROP18-Ty fusion protein with bacterially derived purified wt Irga6 protein and the T102A, T108A, and T102/108A mutant proteins in an in vitro kinase assay, followed by autoradiography on the products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). The wt and all three mutant proteins were phosphorylated by ROP18. However, quantitation of the signal showed a small but consistent reduction for the T102A mutant and highly significant reductions for both the T108A and the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Little ROP18 autophosphorylation was detected at the low ROP18 input concentrations used (indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Confirmation that both T102 and T108 are direct targets for phosphorylation by type I ROP18 was provided by strong signals in a Western blot for the anti-pT102 and anti-pT108 antibodies on Irga6 from a parallel in vitro kinase assay performed with a nonradioactive source of phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). No signals were detected in this assay by each reagent on its specific mutant protein, and from neither reagent on the double mutant protein T102/108A, confirming the specificity of the assay system. We conclude that type I ROP18 is indeed a specific and direct kinase of Irga6 T102 and T108. In vitro, ROP18 clearly also has another minor target of phosphorylation on Irga6 that we have not identified.</p>

<p>The IRG system specifies a number of proteins that act cooperatively in organising the destruction of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> vacuole. It is therefore of interest that a parallel study has identified a second IRG protein, Irgb6, as a target for virulent ROP18 kinase, with strong indications that threonines of the switch I loop are the targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Fentress1">[27]</xref>. In our own studies we can confirm that Irgb6 is also phosphorylated in IFNγ-induced cells infected by the virulent RH-YFP strain, although the level of phosphorylation is considerably lower than that of Irga6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000576.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Likewise, Irgb10 is phosphorylated by RH-YFP, but in IFNγ-induced cells though very weakly above a significant level of intrinsic, infection-independent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000576.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Strong phosphorylation of Irgb10 dependent on RH-YFP infection was, however, seen in cells transfected with a plasmid expressing Irgb10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000576.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Some infection-independent phosphorylation of Irgb10 was also apparent in this experiment. Further analysis is required to establish whether the phosphorylation of Irgb10 involves the same target residues as phosphorylation of Irga6 by virulent ROP18.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the virulence of type I <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains for mice is due at least in part to their ability to inactivate host IRG resistance proteins by targeted phosphorylation of threonine residues in the switch I loop by ROP18 kinase. Threonine residues form part of the catalytic interface essential for the formation of the GTP-dependent active dimer, and their modification, like that of all the residues in the catalytic interface (Pawlowski et al., unpublished data), would be expected to inactivate the resistance protein. The threonine corresponding to T108 is conserved throughout the entire family of IRG proteins in the mouse, and in Irga6 appears to be quantitatively the major target of phosphorylation by type I ROP18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g009">Figure 9</xref>). We and Fentress et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Fentress1">[27]</xref> have shown both Irgb6 and Irgb10 can be phosphorylated and Fentress et al. have shown that Irgb6 can be phosphorylated by ROP18 in the switch I loop, predominantly at the threonine homologous to Irga6 T102. Polymorphism in ROP18 kinase is evidently not the only factor responsible for reduced IRG protein loading onto the PVM of virulent strains since the effect is robust to IFNγ concentrations over 100 U/ml with native virulent strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khaminets1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao2">[17]</xref>) but detectable only at IFNγ concentrations below 3 U/ml with the avirulent CTG strain transgenic for ROP18 from a virulent strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g008">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>In earlier studies, we <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khaminets1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao2">[17]</xref> and another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao3">[18]</xref> showed that the loading of IRG proteins onto the virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> vacuole was seriously impaired, in vitro in IFNγ-induced fibroblasts, and in vivo in primed peritoneal macrophages. Irga6 loading intensity was substantially reduced, though the number of Irga6-positive vacuoles was not much affected, while the loading of Irgb6 and Irgb10 was completely eliminated on the great majority of vacuoles. At that time, both groups tried to show that virulent-strain ROP18 kinase was responsible for these effects, we by transfection of mature virulent ROP18 from RH strain into cells infected with the avirulent type II strain, ME49 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khaminets1">[12]</xref>, the other group by infection in vitro with the same avirulent type III CTG strain transgenic for virulent GT-1 strain ROP18, and the two control strains used in the present report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao3">[18]</xref>. Neither group saw any diminution in IRG protein loading and consequently concluded that ROP18 was not responsible for the differential loading of IRG proteins. How are these earlier findings to be reconciled with the present data, and with the data of Fentress et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Fentress1">[27]</xref>? Our present view is that the earlier failures to show an effect of virulent ROP18 were due to the very high level of cytokine-induced activation of the target cells, in our case with 200 U IFNγ/ml, in the case of the other group following an intense in vivo priming regimen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Zhao3">[18]</xref>. The present experiments show a highly significant effect of the CTG virulent ROP18 transgenic strain (CTG V1) on Irga6 loading only at an IFNγ dose of 0.3 U/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000576-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus virulent ROP18 alone is apparently unable to recapitulate the striking failures of IRG protein loading onto the vacuoles seen even at very high levels of cytokine activation during infection with native virulent type I <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains. Nevertheless, the transgenic virulent ROP18 has been shown to have a substantial influence on virulence in a mouse mortality assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Taylor1">[6]</xref> and on growth and survival of the parasites in IFNγ-induced macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Fentress1">[27]</xref>. A plausible conclusion is that there are other factors in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, over and above ROP18, that can interfere with IRG protein loading onto the vacuoles of type I virulent strains. Future experiments should be directed towards the identification of these factors.</p>
<p>For some time now, it has been clear that the striking virulence differential for mice between the three clonal lineages of <italic>T. gondii</italic> abundant in Eurasia and North America is not reflected in anything comparable in terms of their virulence for humans. There are important clinical differences but it has not been possible to designate these clearly as differences in virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Boothroyd2">[26]</xref>. Our findings offer an interesting form of explanation for this well-established observation since the molecular targets of ROP18 in mouse cells, IFN-inducible IRG proteins, are not present in humans, having been lost in the primate lineage before the separation of the Old and New World monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Bekpen1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Bekpen2">[28]</xref>. Humans organise their resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> along other lines, perhaps involving IFNγ-induced depletion of the essential amino acid tryptophan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Pfefferkorn1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-MacKenzie1">[30]</xref>, for which <italic>T. gondii</italic> is auxotrophic, as well as other mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Murray1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-MacKenzie2">[32]</xref>. The p65 guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) are also plausible candidates for a human resistance mechanism against <italic>T. gondii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Degrandi1">[33]</xref>. However, these proteins are not homologous to the IRG proteins and a role in <italic>T. gondii</italic> resistance remains to be shown. It is possible therefore that the ROP18 kinase has coevolved with the IRG resistance system, so that in humans, in the absence of the IRG system, the ROP18 kinase is nonfunctional and its polymorphism irrelevant. It should be noted that, although the p65 GBPs have a G2 threonine residue in the switch I loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Prakash1">[34]</xref>, there is no significant homology with IRG proteins elsewhere in the switch I loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Klamp1">[35]</xref> or indeed elsewhere in the entire protein that would suggest they would be targeted by a common kinase.</p>
<p>The ROP18 alleles of the three clonal lineages differ strikingly from each other, and there is internal evidence that the protein has been under recent positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khan1">[8]</xref>. The type II allelic product differs from the type I product by 22 amino acids out of 541. Type II ROP18 RNA is expressed at essentially the same level as the type I ROP18 RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khan1">[8]</xref> but our experiments show that type II strain ROP18 protein is apparently relatively incompetent to phosphorylate either Irga6 or Irgb6 in IFNγ-induced cells. The type II ROP18 is, however, an active kinase (T. Steinfeldt, unpublished results), and weak but detectable phosphorylation of Irga6 was detected in IFNγ-induced cells infected with avirulent type II and III strains. It is not yet clear whether this low level of phosphorylation is due to type II or type III ROP18 kinase, respectively. The type III allelic product differs from the type I product at 78 positions, but perhaps more important, its expression level is very greatly reduced by a promoter modification and as a consequence it is considered a null allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Taylor1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Khan1">[8]</xref> though it is not known whether the encoded protein has kinase activity. If the ROP18 system has been under recent positive selection, it is likely that small rodents have played an important role as intermediate hosts because of the recent overwhelming dominance of the domestic cat in determining the rate of <italic>T. gondii</italic> evolution. The IRG system is well developed in this taxonomic group, plausibly in response to selection pressure from <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Thus a functional explanation for the polymorphism in the ROP18 virulence system may be found in a better understanding of the specificity and mode of action of IRG proteins. Recent (unpublished) studies from our laboratory have shown that the IRG system of mice is itself highly polymorphic both structurally and functionally, as is susceptibility to virulent strain <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. The fact that ROP18 is polymorphic may indicate that different alleles are optimised for different targets, perhaps for other mouse IRG protein sequences or IRG proteins from other evolutionarily significant intermediate host species. These considerations also suggest an explanation for the existence of highly virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains in the wild, where they may have a selective advantage in confrontations with mice carrying highly resistant <italic>IRG</italic> alleles capable of providing sterile immunity against less virulent strains.</p>
<p><italic>T. gondii</italic> has extensively diversified the ROP kinase family since its separation from its distant apicomplexan cousin, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, in which these proteins are not found. Other members of the family, some of which have been described as pseudokinases because of destructive modification of the catalytic site, have also been implicated in virulence by genetic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Saeij1">[7]</xref>. Polymorphic ROP16 kinase has recently been shown to act as a tyrosine kinase affecting the host cell inflammatory pathways regulated by STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Yamamoto1">[36]</xref> and STAT6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Ong1">[37]</xref>, probably by direct phosphorylation and activation of these latent transcription factors. Future studies will reveal whether ROP18 is the only member of the ROP kinase family dedicated to the control of the genetically complex and rapidly evolving IRG resistance system, not only in the mouse but also in most mammalian groups outside the higher primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Bekpen1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Bekpen2">[28]</xref>. The IRG resistance system may be modulated to a greater or lesser extent by ROP kinases and pseudokinases of all <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains, each seeking in different mammalian hosts a balance between an excess of virulence, resulting in premature death of the host, and too efficient resistance, resulting in clearance of the parasite and sterile immunity.</p>
<p>The inactivation of IRG proteins by phosphorylation of essential switch I threonines appears to be a potential Achilles heel for resistance mediated by IFNγ-inducible GTPases. The switch I and II loops of Rho family GTPases have been extensively targeted by bacterial glucosylating, deamidating, and ADP-ribosylating enzymes to favour or inhibit phagocytic uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Boquet1">[38]</xref>. However, the destructive phosphorylation of switch I threonines of IRG proteins mediated by <italic>T. gondii</italic> ROP18 kinase appears to be a novel virulence mechanism, in this case targeted against a dedicated resistance system rather than a housekeeping protein, and in this sense resembling in principle the “gene-for-gene” virulence-resistance systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Flor1">[39]</xref> characteristic of R-gene–mediated immunity in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000576-Jones1">[40]</xref>.</p>

This m/z corresponds to two monophosphorylated peptides with the sequence TGVVEVTMER that eluted as two distinct peaks. (B and C) CID fragment spectrum of two peptides with m/z 608.767 separated in (A). For the first elution peak (Mascot ion score 31, delta mass +0.21 ppm) the masses of the fragment ions y4–y9 that contain T108 indicate that this residue is phosphorylated whereas the fragment ions b3–b5 containing T102 show no modification (B). For the second elution peak (Mascot ion score 37, delta mass −0.7 ppm) the masses of the fragment ions b3–b6 containing T102 indicate that this residue is phosphorylated whereas the fragment ions y5–y7 and y9 contain T108 and show no modification (C). Peaks labelled with an asterisk (*) correspond to fragment ions displaying a neutral loss of phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 98 Da).</p>

<p><bold>Irgb6 and Irgb10 are phosphorylated upon type I virulent strain infection.</bold> Irgb6 and Irgb10 were immunoprecipitated from IFNγ-induced or transiently transfected, metabolically labelled L929 cells and infected with virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain RH-YFP or CTG transgenic <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains. (A) A weak <sup>32</sup>P-inorganic phosphate labelled band corresponding to Irgb6 (black arrowhead on the left) was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-Irgb6 antibody, B34, only from IFNγ-induced cells. A very weakly labelled nonspecific band running above the positive control Irga6 (black arrowhead on the right) protein (precipitated with 10E7 antibody) is indicated by an asterisk. (B) A montage of autoradiograms showing immunoprecipitation of Irga6 (left panel), Irgb10 (middle panel) from RH-YFP-infected, CTG transgenic strain-infected, or uninfected L929 cells labelled with <sup>33</sup>P-phosphoric acid. The Irga6 results serve as positive controls (black arrowhead on the left). Phosphorylated Irgb10 (black arrowhead on the left) could be reproducibly immunoprecipitated from uninfected, IFNγ-induced cells, but the signal was enhanced by RH-YFP infection. Two nonspecific labelled bands precipitated by the anti-Irgb10 antiserum are indicated with asterisks. The right panel shows the specificity of the rabbit anti-Irgb10 antiserum, precipitating Irgb10 but not Irga6 from <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine metabolically labelled cells (open arrowheads on the right). Two nonspecifically immunoprecipitated labelled bands are indicated with asterisks. (C) Recombinant Irga6-ctag1 and Irgb10-ctag1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected, IFNγ-induced, <sup>33</sup>P-labelled cells. Phosphorylation of Irgb10 could be demonstrated in uninfected cells but the signal intensity was strongly increased upon infection with virulent RH-YFP <italic>T. gondii</italic> (black arrowhead on the right). Phosphorylation of Irga6 was strictly dependent on infection and served as a positive control (black arrowhead on the left).</p>
