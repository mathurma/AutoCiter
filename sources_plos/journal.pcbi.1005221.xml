<abstract>
<p>Protein phosphorylation underlies cellular response pathways across eukaryotes and is governed by the opposing actions of phosphorylating kinases and de-phosphorylating phosphatases. While kinases and phosphatases have been extensively studied, their organization and the mechanisms by which they balance each other are not well understood. To address these questions we performed quantitative analyses of large-scale 'omics' datasets from yeast, fly, plant, mouse and human. We uncovered an asymmetric balance of a previously-hidden scale: Each organism contained many different kinase genes, and these were balanced by a small set of highly abundant phosphatase proteins. Kinases were much more responsive to perturbations at the gene and protein levels. In addition, kinases had diverse scales of phenotypic impact when manipulated. Phosphatases, in contrast, were stable, highly robust and flatly organized, with rather uniform impact downstream. We validated aspects of this organization experimentally in nematode, and supported additional aspects by theoretic analysis of the dynamics of protein phosphorylation. Our analyses explain the empirical bias in the protein phosphorylation field toward characterization and therapeutic targeting of kinases at the expense of phosphatases. We show quantitatively and broadly that this is not only a historical bias, but stems from wide-ranging differences in their organization and impact. The asymmetric balance between these opposing regulators of protein phosphorylation is also common to opposing regulators of two other post-translational modification systems, suggesting its fundamental value.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Protein phosphorylation is a reversible modification that underlies cellular responses to stimuli across organisms. Historically, the study of protein phosphorylation concentrated on the role of kinases, which introduce the phosphate, at the expense of phosphatases, which remove it. Many kinases have been associated with specific phenotypes and considered attractive drug targets, while phosphatases remained far less characterized. It has been unclear whether this discrepancy is due to historical biases or reflects real systemic differences between these enzymes. By analyzing large-scale ‘omics’ datasets across genes, transcripts, proteins, interactions, and organisms, we uncovered an asymmetric architecture of kinases versus phosphatases that balances between them, determines their distinct impact patterns, and affects their therapeutic potential. This architecture is conserved from yeast to human and is partially shared by two other protein modification systems, suggesting it is a general feature of these systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification, in which a phosphate group is covalently attached to amino acid residues within a protein by the function of a kinase. The phosphorylated protein may acquire a different reactivity, interaction specificity or cellular localization, which allow it to carry functions that the unmodified protein could not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref001">1</xref>]. Protein phosphorylation is reversible, and upon removal of the phosphate group by the function of a phosphatase, the de-phosphorylated protein regains its previous functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref004">4</xref>]. Reversible protein phosphorylation underlies signal transduction and controls main cellular processes across eukaryotes, such as cell-cycle, metabolism, transcription and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref005">5</xref>]. In humans, about 30% of the proteins undergo phosphorylation, many of which in a reversible manner, and abnormal phosphorylation has been associated with complex diseases, cancers, and pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref003">3</xref>]. Protein phosphorylation is therefore under strict regulation, and is governed by the balanced actions of kinases and phosphatases.</p>
<p>The critical role of protein phosphorylation led to extensive studies of kinases and phosphatases, including large-scale 'omics screens that were carried predominantly in budding yeast (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref009">9</xref>]). By using mass spectrometry to analyze kinase and phosphatase interactions, Breitkreutz et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref007">7</xref>] showed that an extensive backbone of kinase-kinase interactions cross-connects the yeast proteome. The profiling of strains carrying inactivated kinases or phosphatases using epistatic mini-arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref006">6</xref>], mRNA profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref008">8</xref>], and phospho-proteomic screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref009">9</xref>] revealed numerous functional overlaps and regulatory relationships among kinases and phosphatases. However, these and other meta-analyses (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref010">10</xref>]) often treated kinases and phosphatases as one group, although their internal organization might differ.</p>
<p>Here, we harnessed 'omics' datasets that were gathered from budding yeast, fly, plant, mouse and human, to gain insight into the functional organization of kinases and phosphatases. In particular, we asked how their organization supports the specific, transient and robust response to signals and perturbations. The field of cell signaling has been discussing these issues for a long time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref011">11</xref>], and answers have been given mostly for a small set of well-studied kinases and phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref012">12</xref>]. Our goal here was to contribute to this discussion by adding a quantitative, wide-ranging perspective across different proteins and different organisms, which has been partial so far. We were able to obtain this quantitative view by meta-analyses of diverse sets of large-scale data. We found that kinases and phosphatases are organized in distinct ways that are conserved across eukaryotes. Firstly, they maintain a quantitative balance, where kinases have many more genes while the few phosphatase proteins are more abundant. Secondly, they have a different responsiveness behavior, to which we provide a dynamics-based theoretic insight. Thirdly, they have a different impact behavior downstream, which we demonstrate experimentally by using the development of the vulva in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as readout. Lastly, we show that some of these features are also shared by the opposing regulators of histone acetylation and of protein ubiquitination in budding yeast, suggesting that these features are inherent to reversible post-translational systems.</p>

<title>Intriguing asymmetries between kinases and phosphatases at the gene and protein levels</title>
<p>We analyzed kinases and phosphatases from the model organisms <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, and from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. These organisms were selected because their kinases and phosphatases were screened in an unbiased manner and because they span different evolutionary routes. Notably, our analyses henceforth focus on the catalytic subunits of kinases and phosphatases (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and Methods</xref>), and do not refer to regulatory or inhibitory subunits of these enzymes, for which less data are available.</p>
<p>We first compared between the numbers of genes coding for kinases versus phosphatases in these eukaryotes. We found large discrepancies: The genome of budding yeast contains 137 kinases and only 50 phosphatases (a ratio of ~2.7:1), the human genome contains 656 kinases and only 184 phosphatases (a ratio of ~3.5:1), and similar preference toward kinases is present in the other genomes that we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Differences in gene numbers, protein abundance and essentiality between kinases and phosphatases are conserved across eukaryotic lineages.</title>
<p>A. Kinase-coding genes are more abundant than phosphatase-coding genes in five eukaryotic genomes. B. Phosphatase proteins are significantly more abundant than kinase proteins in five eukaryotic proteomes. Box plots show the values at the first, second and third quartiles. In parenthesis per organism are the numbers of kinases and phosphatases for which data were available. Median values for kinases and phosphatases, and the respective Mann-Whitney p-values, were as follows: Yeast 30.4, 63, p = 0.008; plant 1.3, 4, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>, fly 7.5, 10.6, p = 0.03; mouse 2.8, 6.3, p = 9*10<sup>−4</sup>; human 0.33, 0.65, p = 5*10<sup>−4</sup>. C. The fraction of phosphatases that are essential for survival in yeast and mouse, or are associated with genetic disease in human, is significantly smaller than the fraction of kinases (yeast p = 0.03, mouse p = 0.0022, human p = 0.0023; Fisher exact test). Yeast = <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>; Plant = <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; Fly = <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>; Mouse = <italic>Mus musculus</italic>; Human = <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. *** indicates p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>; ** indicates p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>; * indicates p&lt;0.05.

<p>How can the small pool of phosphatases revert the actions of the dominating sets of kinases? To answer this question we turned to protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Large-scale measurements of protein abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref013">13</xref>] revealed that phosphatase proteins were roughly twice more abundant than kinases, a difference that was statistically significant across phyla (p≤8.3*10<sup>−3</sup> in yeast, plant, mouse and human, and p = 0.036, in fly, Mann-Whitney). Thus, phosphatases seem to balance their reduced gene numbers by high protein abundance, consistently across diverse eukaryotes. We also tested tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, which constitute small subsets relatively to serine-threonine kinases and phosphatases and are known to have distinct characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref014">14</xref>], and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The relative scarcity in phosphatase genes may suggest that individual phosphatases are critical for viability and health. To test this we compared between the fractions of kinases and phosphatases that were shown to be essential for survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We observed the opposite trend: In budding yeast 23% of the kinases were essential, a fraction that is slightly higher than that of protein-coding genes (18.9%). Yet, only 10% of the phosphatases were essential (Fisher exact test, p = 0.03). For fly and plant such large-scale catalogs of essential genes were not available. In mouse 36.7% of the kinases were associated with a lethal phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref015">15</xref>], relative to 24.8% of the phosphatases (Fisher exact test, p = 2.18*10<sup>−3</sup>). For humans, we analyzed the set of over 3,100 genes that were genetically associated with a human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref016">16</xref>]. Again, kinases were much more critical: 24% were associated with disease, relative to 14.1% of the phosphatases (Fisher exact test, p = 2.3*10<sup>−3</sup>). Thus, the numerous kinases have a strong effect on viability and health, while the fewer phosphatases appear to be much more functionally redundant.</p>

<title>Kinases are more responsive than phosphatases at the gene and protein levels</title>
<p>Kinases and phosphatases are key components in signaling and cellular response pathways across eukaryotes. Therefore, we analyzed their ability to respond to perturbations. We focused on their tendency to alter their expression levels, to interact with other proteins, and to undergo phosphorylation.</p>
<p>To test for changes in gene expression levels, we used transcriptional profiles of over 1,400 perturbation experiments in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref017">17</xref>]. About 34% of the yeast kinases and phosphatases were differentially expressed in at least one perturbation, a fraction that was significantly smaller than all genes (44%, p = 1.9*10<sup>−3</sup>, Fisher exact test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Among those differentially expressed genes, phosphatases changed in significantly fewer perturbation experiments relative to all genes (p = 0.032, Mann-Whitney, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and in fewer perturbation experiments relative to kinases (p = 0.073). Notably, there was no correlation between the number of perturbations in which a gene was differentially expressed and its protein expression levels, and thus the reduced responsiveness of phosphatases could not be attributed simply to their higher abundance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and Methods</xref>). We next tested for differences in the protein stability of kinases and phosphatases by examining protein half-life measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref018">18</xref>]. The protein half-life of kinases was significantly short (p = 2.7*10<sup>−3</sup>, Mann-Whitney test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), while that of phosphatases was similar to all genes, supporting the more dynamic nature of kinases.</p>

<title>Kinases genes and proteins are more responsive than phosphatases.</title>
<p>A. Yeast phosphatases are differentially expressed in fewer perturbations relative to all genes in yeast (p = 0.032, Mann-Whitney test). The data refer to the 45 kinases, 15 phosphatases, and 2979 protein-coding genes that were differentially expressed in at least one perturbation. B. Kinases are significantly more involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) relative to phosphatases (*) or to all proteins (+). The numbers of kinases, phosphatases, and protein-coding genes for which PPI data were available, and the respective Mann-Whitney p-value per organism, were as follows: Yeast 135, 49, 4,925, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>; plant 377, 89, 6,430, p = 0.008; fly 213, 85, 9,539, p = 0.032; mouse 311, 52, 5,527, p = 2*10<sup>−9</sup>; human 633, 177, 16,387, p = 9*10<sup>−7</sup>. C. The capacity of yeast kinases to undergo phosphorylation is significantly higher than the capacity of phosphatases. This is observed in data of manually-curated phosphorylation / de-phosphorylation interactions (denoted known events), p = 5.7*10<sup>−6</sup>; in phospho-peptide abundance measurements, p = 9.7*10<sup>−5</sup>; and in a dataset of conserved phosphorylation sites within protein sequences, p = 1.4*10<sup>−7</sup> (Fisher exact test).

</fig>
<p>One of the main ways by which kinases and phosphatases respond to perturbations is by interacting with other proteins. To assess their capacity for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we gathered data of experimentally detected PPIs within each organism (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and Methods</xref>). In all organisms, kinases were significantly more involved in PPIs than other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), as was previously shown for yeast alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref007">7</xref>]. In yeast and human, which had the largest PPI coverage, kinases were also more involved in PPIs relative to phosphatases, supporting their increased responsiveness.</p>
<p>Lastly, we tested the capacity of kinases and phosphatases to undergo protein phosphorylation. For this we used three types of data: data of manually curated phosphorylation or de-phosphorylation interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref006">6</xref>], measurements of changes in phospho-peptide abundance upon perturbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref009">9</xref>], and a dataset of conserved phosphorylation sites between yeast and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref019">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In all datasets, over 40% of the kinases showed capacity for phosphorylation, relative to at most 12% of the phosphatases (p≤9.8*10<sup>−5</sup>, Mann-Whitney test). The observation that phosphatases are less phosphorylated than kinases is not necessarily expected from their different enzymatic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref020">20</xref>]. In fact, some well-studied phosphatases, such as the family of CDC25 dual specificity phosphatases that regulates cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref021">21</xref>], and the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-1B that regulates insulin and leptin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref022">22</xref>], have been shown to be heavily regulated by phosphorylation. Yet, our analysis shows that, as a group, phosphatases have a lower capacity for undergoing phosphorylation. In summary, the different analyses we carried suggest that kinases have a significantly higher tendency and capacity to respond to signals at the gene and protein levels, while phosphatases seem relatively static.</p>

<title>A layered architecture of kinases and a flat organization of phosphatases</title>
<p>The large numbers of distinct kinase genes per organism led us to hypothesize that kinases may be organized in a hierarchical manner. Hierarchical analysis was used previously to organize transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref026">26</xref>], and a unified set of kinases and phosphatases, based on their regulatory relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref010">10</xref>]. Here, we defined relationships between kinases by their impact on the phosphorylation of each other, which were measured in a series of phospho-proteomic screens of budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref009">9</xref>]. There, a kinase was considered to impact a target protein when the inactivation of the kinase resulted in the differential phosphorylation of the target protein. We modeled these impact relationships between kinases as a network, where nodes represent kinases and directed edges point from the impacting kinase to its target kinase. We then created a hierarchy of kinases by their impact relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The top layer contained 38 kinases that impact other kinases but are not targeted by any kinase. The middle layer contained 26 kinases that are both targeted by kinases and also impact other kinases. The bottom layer contained 28 kinases that are targeted by other kinases and do not impact any kinase. 45 kinases without any kinase impact relationships were termed 'outgroup' and were omitted from further analyses.</p>

<title>A hierarchical organization of yeast kinases by their impact.</title>
<p>A. A layered architecture of kinases by their impact on the phosphorylation of each other. Impact edges point from the inactivated kinase (or phosphatase) down to its differentially-phosphorylated targets. Kinases and phosphatases with no impact relationship to other kinases / phosphatases appear as grids at the bottom. Kinases in the top, middle and bottom layers appear as blue, light-blue or green nodes, respectively; phosphatases appear in red. Node sizes reflect the number of target proteins. B. The impact of kinases and phosphatases on gene expression. Impact of an individual kinase (or phosphatase) was defined as the number of genes that were differentially expressed upon kinase (or phosphatase) inactivation. The impact of kinases from each layer decreased upon moving down the hierarchy, with bottom-layer kinases affecting the expression of significantly smaller sets of genes (p = 0.037, Mann-Whitney test). Data were available for 14 top-layer, 10 middle-layer, and 10 bottom-layer kinases, and for 18 phosphatases. Box plots show the values at the first, second and third quartiles. C. The phenotypic impact of kinases and phosphatases, as measured by the percentage of essential genes in each subset. The phenotypic impact of kinases decreased upon moving down the hierarchy. TOP = top layer, MID = middle layer, BOT = bottom layer, OUT = outgroup, PHO = phosphatases. * indicates p&lt;0.05.</p>

</fig>
<p>To validate the resulting kinase hierarchy we used additional phosphorylation-related datasets. These included kinase impacts on the entire proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref009">9</xref>], manually-curated phosphorylation interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref006">6</xref>], the presence of experimentally verified phosphorylation sites within kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref027">27</xref>], as well as the presence of conserved, and thus more likely functional, phosphorylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref019">19</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, in each dataset the different layers had distinct behaviors that were consistent with the impact-based organization of kinases. For example, top-layer kinases had significantly few conserved phosphorylation sites, whereas bottom-layer kinases had significantly more such sites, supporting their different tendencies to undergo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s003">S3D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next analyzed the impact of kinases on downstream targets using other types of data. For that, we analyzed the impact of kinases on gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref017">17</xref>]. Inactivation of kinases from the top layer affected the expression of the largest sets of genes, and this effect decreased upon moving down the hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We also tested the impact of kinases on survival. The top layer had the largest fraction of kinases that were essential for survival, while the bottom layer had the lowest fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The distinct features of each layer were preserved upon refining the hierarchy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and Methods</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s004">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Thus, while phospho-proteomic data may have caveats, comparisons to several other types of data show that upper layers indeed have broader impacts downstream.</p>
<p>Unlike kinases, phosphatases did not show a layered architecture. Phosphatases were involved in few intra-phosphatase impact relationships, and, in accordance with the kinase hierarchy, mainly affected kinases in the middle and bottom layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Phosphatases had limited impact on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and on survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Thus kinases and phosphatases differ in their organization and impact behavior in budding yeast.</p>
<p>We turned to the nematode <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> to experimentally compare the impact of kinases and phosphatases on a specific phenotype, using the well characterized vulva differentiation system. The development of the vulva in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) activation of RAS, WNT/beta-catenin and Notch signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref028">28</xref>]. Disrupting these signaling cascades can lead to decreased vulva induction causing a Vulvaless (Vul) phenotype, or activation of vulva induction, resulting in Multivulva (Muv) phenotype. The <italic>let-60(ga89)</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> RAS) and <italic>bar-1(ga80)</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> beta-catenin) alleles show low penetrance of Vul or Muv phenotypes depending on cultivation condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, they provide sensitize backgrounds to explore and compare between the impact of various kinases and phosphatases that were previously associated with disruption of vulva development.</p>
<p>Similarly to the other eukaryotes that we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> had many more genes coding for kinases than phosphatases (455 kinases relative to 177 phosphatases, a ratio of ~2.6:1). To assemble an extensive list of kinases and phosphatases that were previously associated with vulva phenotypes, we retrieved from WormBase all the kinases and phosphatases that were annotated with Vul or Muv phenotypes in any genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref030">30</xref>]. This resulted in eight kinases and four phosphatases. In wild type background, the knockdown by RNAi of any of these kinases and phosphatases did not result in vulva phenotypes, stressing the robustness of vulva development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref030">30</xref>]. We then repeated this experiment in a RAS or beta-catenin mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In the RAS mutant, background treatment with empty vector control showed defective vulva (Vul or Muv phenotypes) in 4.6±1.8% of the <italic>let-60(ga89)</italic> animals. RNAi knockdown of individual kinases resulted in a wide differential scale of phenotypic impact, ranging from strong to no significant impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Of note, three of the four significant responder kinases, <italic>mek-2</italic>, <italic>mpk-</italic>1 and <italic>lin-2</italic>, are known members of the RAS/LET-60 vulva-signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref030">30</xref>], validating our analysis. In contrast, the four phosphatases had a medium impact with no significant difference between any two phosphatases examined (p&gt;0.11, Mann-Whitney test). In the beta-catenin mutant background, treatment with empty vector control showed defective vulva in 11.1±3.6% of the <italic>bar-1(ga80)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). RNAi knockdown of individual kinases again resulted in wide scale of phenotypic impact, but the significant responders varied from the RAS mutant background. Similarly to the RAS mutant background, all four phosphatases had a medium impact. Thus, these data suggest that distinct kinases impact the output of a specific signaling pathway. In contrast, any given phosphatase resulted in a comparable phenotype, suggesting that in a sensitized background, phosphatases are interchangeable while kinases less so.</p>

<p>The observation that phosphatases had a noticeable phenotype in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> may seem surprising given their lower essentiality rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

We, therefore, turned back to yeast to examine if sensitized background can impact phosphatases requirement. A negative genetic interaction (NGI) is called between two genes, <italic>g1</italic> and <italic>g2</italic>, when the strain carrying both deletions shows reduced growth relative to expectation based on the growth of a strain carrying a <italic>g1</italic> deletion and a strain carrying a <italic>g2</italic> deletion. Using data from a screen for NGIs involving kinases or phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref006">6</xref>], we found that yeast phosphatases were slightly more involved in NGIs than kinases: 74% of the yeast phosphatases had at least one NGI, compared to 67% of the kinases. Additionally, phosphatases had a median of 4 NGIs per gene, relative to 2 NGIs for kinases. Thus, while yeast cells tolerate single deletion of phosphatases better than single deletion of kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), in a sensitized background yeast cells were as sensitive to phosphatase deletion as they were to kinase deletion, in agreement with the results of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> screen.</p>

<title>Asymmetries are evident in other post-translational modification systems</title>
<p>Are the characteristics we observed above also present in other reversible post-translational modification systems? For this we turned to the histone acetylation system, which regulates transcription through the action of histone-acetyltransferases and histone-deacetylases, and the protein ubiquitination system, which regulates protein function and fate through the action of ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin proteases. Henceforth, we refer to histone-acetyltransferases and ubiquitin ligases as 'writers' since they add the modification (similarly to kinases), and to histone-deacetylases and ubiquitin proteases as 'erasers' since they remove the modification (similarly to phosphatases). We focused on analyses of budding yeast where data were available. For other post translational modification systems we did not have enough data, or the number of genes was too small for a reliable comparison of the different properties.</p>
<p>Similarly to kinases and phosphatases, writers were encoded by many more genes relative to erasers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and their protein products were significantly less abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Furthermore, a much larger fraction of the writers were essential for survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), and they had more PPI partners relative to all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Historically, the study of protein phosphorylation concentrated mainly on the role of kinases at the expense of phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref011">11</xref>]. Many kinases have been associated with specific functions and phenotypes, while phosphatases remained far less characterized. This difference has pharmaceutical implications that become apparent upon examining the targets of approved drugs: 17% of the human kinases were targeted by drugs, relative to only 6.5% of the human phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref031">31</xref>]. However, it has been unclear whether this discrepancy is due to historical biases, or reflects a real difference in the organization and impact of kinases versus phosphatases. Here, we addressed this discrepancy systematically by analyzing data from unbiased 'omics' screens across genes, transcripts, proteins, interactions, and organisms.</p>
<p>Our first observation regards the quantitative relationships between kinases and phosphatases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Despite the seeming symmetry between kinases and phosphatases, which act on the same protein targets, eukaryotic genomes contain numerous kinase genes, over twice the number of phosphatase genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref012">12</xref>]. Nonetheless, we show that a quantitative balance is maintained between kinases and phosphatases at the protein level, since the fewer phosphatase genes encode high-copy proteins. These high-copy proteins can be incorporated into different phosphatase complexes with distinct regulatory subunits, activities and specificities, as has been shown for some well-studied phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Our second observation relates to the outcome of interference with kinases versus phosphatases. Given the numerous kinase genes per organism, one may hypothesize that interference with a specific kinase might lead to a kinase-specific response, whereas interference with a specific phosphatase might lead to a more general response. Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by our analyses of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> vulva development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The phenotypes obtained upon knocking down individual kinase were variable and background-specific. In one background, some kinases had strong effects on vulva development, some had medium effects while other had no effect, whereas in another background, the effects of the same kinases were different. In contrast, knocking down any phosphatase gave a medium phenotype, with little variability among the phosphatases.</p>
<p>The scalable, variable impacts of kinases were not limited to a specific <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> system but also genome-wide, as we observed in budding yeast. Using hierarchical analysis, we identified a hierarchy of kinases that was not shown before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This hierarchy was relevant to the impact of kinases on the yeast phospho-proteome, transcriptome, and organism fitness. Notably, we did not observe a hierarchy of phosphatases. Together with the experimental analysis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, this suggests that kinases have a broad range of specificities and impact that helps them mediate highly-specific responses to signals. This broad range makes kinases easier to characterize, and more favorable drug targets. In contrast, the relative uniformity among phosphatases implies that, in general, phosphatases are less favorable targets for controlling specific phenotypes. The discrepancy in the characterization of kinases at the expense of phosphatases is thus rooted in the different organization of each group.</p>
<p>Another feature that differed between kinases and phosphatases is their responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Kinases were more responsive and had a higher capacity to change at the gene and protein levels, making them specialized regulators that can rapidly alter their behavior and fine-tune cellular responses to signals. Phosphatases were less responsive, in agreement with the view that many phosphatases are catalytically active continuously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref032">32</xref>]. We remind here that our analysis was focused on the catalytic subunits of kinases and phosphatases. The responsiveness and specificity of phosphatase complexes involves additional factors, including dynamic changes in their regulatory and inhibitory subunits, in the concentrations of relevant ions such as calcium, in their cellular localization, and more, as shown for the extensively studied PP1 and PP2A phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref020">20</xref>]. The responsiveness of these factors and the elucidation of their effects on phosphatase activity are most intriguing, and their analysis will become feasible once more data are collected.</p>
<p>What are the benefits in having the catalytic subunits of phosphatases generally active, while kinases alter their activity in response to perturbations? One clear benefit is noise reduction: Kinases are less likely to trigger a response accidentally or prolong it, since the continuously active phosphatases can quickly attenuate the response. The serine/threonine phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a prominent example: this ubiquitous phosphatase acts as a "green" enzyme, promoting the recycling of proteins and the reversal of cells to basal and/or energy-conserving state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref033">33</xref>]. This "driving with one foot on the break" strategy is common to many short-term processes, such as insulin signaling and glycogen metabolism, RAS GTPase signaling, activation of the transcription factor CREB and more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Another feature that could be influenced by having phosphatases continuously active is phosphorylation dynamics. Below, we investigated phosphorylation dynamics as a function of the responsiveness of kinases and phosphatases. We analyzed a simplified scenario where a protein Y is reversibly phosphorylated. The concentration of the phosphorylated protein, denoted <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup>, depends on the activity level of its kinase, denoted <italic>k</italic>, and the activity level of its phosphatase, denoted <italic>p</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Since the expression level of <italic>Y</italic> is often much higher than the level of its phosphorylated form <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref036">36</xref>], the change in the concentration of <italic>Y</italic> can be ignored, and the change in <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup> can be described by the following equation: <italic>d Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup><italic>/ d</italic>t = <italic>k</italic>–<italic>p Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref037">37</xref>] and see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and Methods</xref>). The steady state level of <italic>Y</italic><sup>P</sup>, denoted <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic>_<italic>st</italic></sup>, is thus given by: <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic>_<italic>st</italic></sup> = <italic>k</italic> / <italic>p</italic>. Note that <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic>_<italic>st</italic></sup> can be doubled in two ways: Either the kinase becomes twice more active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), or the phosphatase becomes only half active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). While both of these scenarios seem to lead to the same end result, the response time at which <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup> reaches <italic>Y</italic><sup><italic>P</italic>_<italic>st</italic></sup>/2, denoted <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub>, is different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref037">37</xref>]: The change in the <italic>k</italic> does not affect <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), whereas the change in <italic>p</italic> leads to a doubling of <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Response time is a crucial factor in the ability of cells to adapt to changes in their environment. Thus, in this simplified scenario, keeping phosphatases intact, namely less responsive, and fine-tuning the activity of kinases, rendering them responsive, helps maintain timely responses to stimuli.</p>

<p>The asymmetry that we observed between kinases and phosphatases is inherent to their actions: although they act on the same targets, phosphatases always act after kinases do. We thus asked if other reversible cellular systems with writers and erasers behave similarly. We find that in budding yeast, the reversible systems of histone acetylation and protein ubiquitination show similar quantitative relationships and similar impact on fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Once suitable data become available, it will be intriguing to check whether hierarchical organization and differences in responsiveness are also maintained in those systems, whether other reversible systems such as protein methylation behave similarly, and what other features accompany this behavior.</p>
<p>In summary, we found that across eukaryotes kinases and phosphatases have an intriguing balance and are organized differently. Some of these features were previously demonstrated for specific kinases and phosphatases, and likewise, they may not describe every kinase and phosphatase. However, we show here quantitatively and broadly that these asymmetries hold widely in phosphorylation systems of diverse eukaryotes. They go hand-in-hand with the maintenance of transient, signal-specific responses, and provide insight into the different propensity of kinases and phosphatases to impact phenotypes.</p>

<title>Hierarchy construction</title>
<p>Kinases were divided into layers according to the numbers of their impact-target relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref009">9</xref>]. The top layer contained kinases that impacted kinases and were not targeted by any kinase. The middle layer contained kinases that impacted kinases and were also targeted by kinases. The bottom layer contained kinases that did not impact any kinase and were targeted by kinases. The outgroup contained kinases with no impact or target relationships with any kinase, and was further ignored. Phosphatases were incorporated into the hierarchy by considering impact relationships among phosphatases, and between phosphatases and kinases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005221.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The hierarchy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005221.g003">Fig 3A</xref> was depicted using Cytoscape 2.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005221.ref053">53</xref>].

Secondly, we recreated the hierarchy so that the assignment of a kinase to a layer will be more robust, i.e., will not depend on a single impact relationship. Specifically, a kinase was associated with (i) the top layer, if the kinase impacted two or more kinases, and was the target of at most one kinase (which could be noise); (ii) the middle layer, if it impacted two or more kinases and was targeted by two or more kinases; and (iii) the bottom layer, if it impacted at most one kinase and was targeted by two or more kinases.

<title>Differences in gene numbers, protein abundance, essentiality and protein-protein interactions between curated kinases and phosphatases.</title>
<p>We repeated our analyses using lists of curated kinases and phosphatases from the following organism-specific databases: Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) for yeast, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) for plant, FlyBase for fly and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) for mouse. For human, we obtained data from PhosphoSitePlus website: Kinases were extracted as genes with 'kinase, protein' annotation, and phosphatases as genes with at least one of the following annotations: 'Protein phosphatase, dual-specificity', 'Protein phosphatase, Ser/Thr (non-receptor)', 'Protein phosphatase, tyrosine (non-receptor)' or 'Receptor protein phosphatase, tyrosine'.</p>
<p><list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>A</label><p>Kinase-coding genes are more abundant than phosphatase-coding genes in the five eukaryotic genomes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>B</label><p>Phosphatase proteins are significantly more abundant than kinase proteins in the five eukaryotic proteomes. Median values for kinases, phosphatases and Mann-Whitney p-values per organism are as follows: yeast 30.4, 61.3, p = 0.008; plant 1.3, 4.1, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>; fly 7.8, 10.6, p = 0.044; mouse 2.8, 6.3, p = 9*10<sup>−4</sup>; human 0.31, 0.4, p = 0.03.
