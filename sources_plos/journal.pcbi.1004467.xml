<abstract>
<p>Many genes can play a role in multiple biological processes or molecular functions. Identifying multifunctional genes at the genome-wide level and studying their properties can shed light upon the complexity of molecular events that underpin cellular functioning, thereby leading to a better understanding of the functional landscape of the cell. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of multifunctional genes (and the proteins they encode) has been limited. Here we introduce a computational approach that uses known functional annotations to extract genes playing a role in at least two distinct biological processes. We leverage functional genomics data sets for three organisms—<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>—and show that, as compared to other annotated genes, genes involved in multiple biological processes possess distinct physicochemical properties, are more broadly expressed, tend to be more central in protein interaction networks, tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, and are more likely to be essential. We also find that multifunctional genes are significantly more likely to be involved in human disorders. These same features also hold when multifunctionality is defined with respect to molecular functions instead of biological processes. Our analysis uncovers key features about multifunctional genes, and is a step towards a better genome-wide understanding of gene multifunctionality.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Almost every aspect of cellular function depends on protein activity. In spite of being fine-tuned to carry out highly specific functions, proteins can also multitask. Experimental studies have identified genes and proteins endowed with more than one molecular function, or participating in very different biological processes. These studies suggest that the degree of functional plasticity exhibited by proteins might go well beyond a simple “one protein—one function” relationship. However, systematic studies of the properties of multifunctional genes (and their encoded proteins) have been limited. Here we present a computational framework to identify putative multifunctional genes, and compare their properties with those of other genes. We find that multifunctional genes are significantly different from other genes with respect to their physicochemical properties, expression profiles, and interaction properties. We also observe that multifunctional genes tend to be more conserved, and that a greater fraction of them are associated with human disorders. Taken together, these results represent a step towards a more complete understanding of the role multifunctional genes play in the functional organization of the cell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multifunctionality can be defined as the involvement of a gene in multiple cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref001">1</xref>]. This can come about either because a protein coded by a gene is capable of performing distinct molecular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref006">6</xref>], or as a result of a single molecular function being performed in different contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref008">8</xref>]. For example, pioneering experimental work led to the surprising finding that crystallins—the proteins responsible for the optical properties of the eye lens—can also play non-refractive roles and have enzymatic activity in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref002">2</xref>]. This evolutionary strategy was named “gene sharing” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref009">9</xref>]. Further examples of proteins performing multiple molecular functions were subsequently described: a uracil-DNA glycosylase that can also function as a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or the enzyme thrombin that can moonlight as a ligand for surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref003">3</xref>]. More recently, a large-scale screening of mutants in yeast was performed to measure the pleiotropic effects of genes under different conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref010">10</xref>]. In the case of pleiotropy, a gene may perform only one molecular function, but it can be involved in multiple biological processes, and its perturbation can therefore have pleiotropic consequences.</p>
<p>Though multifunctionality has been characterized in detail only for a few case studies, it is likely to be a common phenomenon. Nevertheless, multifunctionality remains poorly understood. Fortunately, the current state of known gene functional annotations for several organisms gives us an opportunity to systematically identify multifunctional genes and analyze their properties. Earlier computational studies have attempted to identify multifunctional genes from functional annotations available for genes in different organisms. Several previous works measured multifunctionality by simply counting the number of distinct Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms annotating a gene product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref014">14</xref>]. While intuitive and straightforward, these approaches do not always guarantee that a gene annotated with more than one GO term is indeed involved in two distinct biological processes. In particular, this assumption is incorrect when one term is a descendant of another term in the GO hierarchy. To better handle the hierarchical organization of GO, an alternate approach considered the total number of distinct GO “leaf” terms annotating a gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref015">15</xref>], and a recent analysis used semantic similarity between GO terms to identify moonlighting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref016">16</xref>]. However, problems may also arise even when two terms are in completely different branches of the ontology, as idiosyncrasies in GO may lead to similar processes being categorized in distinct places in the ontology. Methods to overcome this redundancy by focusing on a manually curated subset of terms (e.g., GO Slim or other gold standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref019">19</xref>]), even though suitable for tasks such as function prediction, can introduce a bias from manual curation to the analysis of gene multifunctionality, and also may not be generalizable as more annotations become available. Other approaches have used protein-protein interaction data and defined proteins as multifunctional if they are located at the intersection of overlapping clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref020">20</xref>]. However, computationally derived clusters can differ substantially depending on the algorithm used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref021">21</xref>], thereby leading to imprecise views of multifunctionality. Further, using interaction data to define multifunctional genes has the obvious drawback of preventing an unbiased analysis of these genes’ network properties.</p>
<p>In our work, we develop a computational approach to identify multifunctional genes that leverages GO functional annotations in a systematic and robust manner. To handle similar terms that appear in distant places in GO, we explicitly select sets of terms that do not co-annotate an enriched number of genes; these terms are then used to identify multifunctional genes. We apply our procedure to detect multifunctional genes to three organisms—human, fly and yeast—and then compare in each organism the properties of multifunctional genes (and the proteins they encode) with those of other annotated genes. Our results across these species consistently show that, as compared to other genes, multifunctional genes possess distinct physicochemical properties, are more broadly expressed across cell types and tissues, tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, are more likely to be essential, and are topologically distinct in protein-protein interaction networks, in regulatory transcription factor–gene networks and in genetic interaction networks. We also find that multifunctional genes are significantly more likely to be involved in human disorders than other genes. Overall, our analysis leads to a more complete understanding of the role multifunctional genes play in the functional organization of the cell.</p>

<title>Genome-wide detection of multifunctional genes</title>
<p>We use functional annotations of genes in three organisms, <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, to identify multifunctional genes in each of them at the genome-wide level. To accomplish this, we use Biological Process GO annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref022">22</xref>], though in subsequent analyses we also consider multifunctionality with respect to Molecular Function. In the remaining text, when we refer to GO annotations, we refer to Biological Process terms unless otherwise specified. Our method for detecting multifunctional genes is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g001">Fig 1</xref> and is briefly described below (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</p>

<title>Schematic representation of the pipeline to identify multifunctional genes.</title>
<p>We define as multifunctional all genes that have two or more annotations by distinct terms of comparable specificity. (A) First, we extract a subset of Gene Ontology terms at a comparable level of specificity. For a specificity threshold <italic>N</italic>, we select all terms that annotate at least <italic>N</italic>, but fewer than 2<italic>N</italic> genes, whose every descendant term (if any) annotates fewer than <italic>N</italic> genes. For example, if <italic>N</italic> = 90, then terms A and F are selected because each of them annotates more than 90 genes and less than 180 genes, and each of their descendant terms annotates less than 90 genes. In contrast, term E is rejected, because its descendant term F annotates more than 90 genes. Term H is also rejected, because it annotates more than 180 genes. (B) Once terms at a certain specificity level have been selected, we extract all genes annotated with at least two such terms. In order to consider annotations by distinct terms only, from the collection of all pairs of terms selected at the chosen level of specificity, we filter out those that either share a common ancestor (other than the root) or have a common descendant term in the GO graph. Further, we remove all pairs of terms that co-annotate more genes than expected by chance, as measured by the hypergeometric test. All genes co-annotated by some pair of terms (chosen at any considered level of specificity) passing these two filters are considered multifunctional.</p>

<p>The Biological Process GO is a hierarchy of terms representing different aspects of biological processes, where the terms range from very general to very specific and a relationship between terms indicates if one term implies another. We therefore start by selecting a subset of comparable terms that do not have ancestor or descendant relationships amongst themselves. This set of terms can be chosen at different specificity levels, represented by a parameter <italic>N</italic> corresponding to the number of genes annotated by a term. Lower values of this parameter produce larger numbers of more specific terms, and higher values result in smaller numbers of more general terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). We consider several distinct levels of specificity and call multifunctional all genes for which we find evidence of multifunctionality at any specificity level.</p>
<p>Once the terms have been selected at a particular specificity level, we extract all genes annotated with at least two such terms. In order to select only pairs of distinct terms and make sure a gene annotated by both terms is truly multifunctional, we apply several filters to pairs of terms. From the collection of all pairs of terms at a particular specificity level, we filter out those that either share a common ancestor (other than the root) or have a common descendant term in the GO graph, as these events indicate that the terms are semantically related. However, this is not sufficient to claim that the remaining pairs of terms are distinct. For example, the terms <monospace>aerobic respiration</monospace> and <monospace>mitochondrial translation</monospace> do not have any ancestral or descendant term in common in the GO hierarchy graph besides the most general <monospace>biological process</monospace> term, but often co-annotate mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and capture semantically distinct aspects of the same function. Therefore, we further remove all pairs of terms that co-annotate more genes than expected by chance (as detected by the hypergeometric test). All genes co-annotated by some pair of chosen terms passing these two filters, for any set of chosen terms at each specificity level <italic>N</italic> considered, are called multifunctional. We note that, depending upon the application, our filters can be relaxed to consider more genes as multifunctional; for example, two biological processes may be considered distinct if they share a common ancestor that is sufficiently general. However, here we aim to identify genes that have the strongest evidence of multifunctionality.</p>
<p>In what follows, we compare multifunctional genes detected in fly, human, and yeast with all other annotated genes in these organisms in order to uncover whether there are significant differences between the two groups with respect to various biological properties. The number of multifunctional genes and the total number of annotated genes for each organism is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004467.t001">Table 1</xref>, and the actual lists of identified multifunctional genes are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s020">S1 File</xref> for fly, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s021">S2 File</xref> for human, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s022">S3 File</xref> for yeast. We note that a small number of experimentally verified human, fly and yeast genes with multiple functions are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref024">24</xref>], and our method is able to successfully detect a significant fraction of these genes (see Section 1.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s001">S1 Text</xref>).</p>

<title>Proteins encoded by multifunctional genes are longer, have more domains and have a higher fraction of disordered residues</title>
<p>We start the analysis by studying some basic physicochemical properties of proteins. First, we hypothesized that multifunctional proteins may be longer than other proteins in order to accommodate more functional domains. To test this hypothesis, we compare the lengths of proteins encoded by multifunctional and other annotated genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and indeed find that multifunctional genes are significantly longer than other genes (<italic>p</italic>-values 1<italic>e</italic>-39, 1<italic>e</italic>-9, and 8<italic>e</italic>-12, respectively, Mann–Whitney U test), on average by 39%, 16%, and 15%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We also observe that proteins encoded by multifunctional genes have significantly higher numbers of distinct domains per protein (<italic>p</italic>-values 2<italic>e</italic>-7, 1<italic>e</italic>-10, and 2<italic>e</italic>-4, respectively), on average by 17%, 13%, and 8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g002">Fig 2</xref>); this is consistent with the earlier finding of a small but statistically significant positive correlation between the number of GO biological process leaf terms a gene has and its number of Pfam domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref015">15</xref>]. However, we also note that longer proteins have more domains, so the difference in length between multifunctional and other genes can potentially explain the observed difference in the number of domains (see Section 1.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s001">S1 Text</xref>).</p>

<p>Another mechanism that has been proposed to play a role in protein multifunctionality is the presence of intrinsically unstructured regions, which are thought to increase the structural adaptability of interaction surfaces of proteins to allow them to bind to the same or distinct partners with different effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref025">25</xref>]. To determine whether multifunctional proteins tend to be more disordered, we predict the fraction of disordered residues using the IUPred program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref027">27</xref>], and find that multifunctional genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have a significantly higher fraction of predicted disordered residues (<italic>p</italic>-values 6<italic>e</italic>-21, 7<italic>e</italic>-4, and 3<italic>e</italic>-14, respectively), on average by 26%, 5%, and 31%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These results are in agreement with recent analyses of disordered regions in experimentally verified moonlighting proteins and a small set of computationally inferred moonlighting proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, we find that proteins encoded by multifunctional genes are longer, have more domains and are more disordered than proteins encoded by other annotated genes.</p>

<title>Multifunctional genes are expressed more broadly in fly and human</title>
<p>Differential gene expression is evident across tissues and cell types. A gene expressed in different contexts may have different functions depending upon how and when it is expressed. Therefore, we hypothesized that a gene associated with multiple distinct functions may be expressed in a larger number of contexts. In order to assess the relationship between gene expression and gene multifunctionality, we use genome-wide mRNA expression data and count in how many conditions, tissues or cell types each gene is expressed. For fly, we use two datasets: (1) FlyAtlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref028">28</xref>], the Drosophila microarray gene expression atlas across different tissues in larva and adult, and (2) RNA-seq data from modENCODE across many different tissues and development time points, as aggregated by FlyBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref030">30</xref>]. For human, we use information about organism parts in which genes are expressed, obtained from Ensembl BioMart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref031">31</xref>]. We observe that in both human and fly, multifunctional genes are expressed more broadly than other annotated genes; that is, they are expressed in a significantly larger number of tissues or organism parts (<italic>p</italic>-values from 7<italic>e</italic>-38 to 2<italic>e</italic>-4, Mann–Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>A potential mechanism for gene multifunctionality is the production via alternative splicing of multiple protein isoforms with different functions. Indeed, we observe that multifunctional genes have a significantly larger number of known isoforms in fly and human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). If different isoforms of a gene have different expression patterns, this gene may be detected as broadly expressed in genome-wide assays, which currently report expression only at the gene level, merging information about the expression of different isoforms. Indeed, we observe a significant positive correlation between the number of isoforms per gene and the number of tissues or organism parts in which it is expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s016">S1 Table</xref>). However, when comparing genes with an equal number of known isoforms, we still observe that multifunctional genes are expressed in larger numbers of tissues or organism parts (although most <italic>p</italic>-values for human are above our significance threshold of 5%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). This indicates that multifunctional genes are more broadly expressed regardless of the number of isoforms.</p>

<title>Multifunctionality is evolutionarily conserved</title>
<p>Acquiring multiple functions may constitute a special evolutionary strategy and limit gene evolutionary rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref009">9</xref>]. In order to study the evolutionary dynamics of gene multifunctionality at the genome-wide level and in an unbiased manner, we use evolutionary conservation scores from phastCons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref032">32</xref>]. Scores in phastCons are computed using phylogenetic hidden Markov models of multiple sequence alignments of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> with 14 other insect genomes, of <italic>H. sapiens</italic> with 99 other vertebrate genomes, and of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with 6 other yeast species. For each nucleotide of the genome, phastCons produces a score between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate stronger evolutionary conservation. For each gene, we average the scores of all nucleotides of each isoform of the gene, and then average over all isoforms of the gene to obtain a single value for each gene as an estimate of how evolutionarily conserved the gene is. Previously, a positive correlation between the number of biological process GO terms a protein is annotated with and its evolutionary conservation was observed for yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref033">33</xref>].

<p>Having shown that multifunctional genes tend to evolve more slowly, we next hypothesized that multifunctional genes independently detected in different organisms may be orthologous to each other. In order to test this, we compare the property of multifunctionality for orthologous proteins from different organisms. We use information about protein orthology from P-POD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref034">34</xref>] and count how many orthologous pairs are observed where both corresponding genes are identified as multifunctional. Between fly and human, we observe 1725 orthologous pairs of genes where one gene is classified as multifunctional in fly and the other gene is classified as multifunctional in human. To assess significance, we compute the same number when randomly reshuffling multifunctional and other annotated genes from orthologous pairs in each organism, and observe on average only 845.1 ± 90.0 orthologous pairs where both genes are classified as multifunctional; thus, the actual value is 2.0 times higher (empirical <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 1<italic>e</italic>-3). For fly and yeast, we find 388 orthologous pairs between multifunctional genes (2.1 times higher than 184.7 ± 20.2 expected by chance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1<italic>e</italic>-3). For human and yeast, we find 576 orthologous pairs between multifunctional genes (2.2 times higher than 267.2 ± 32.6 expected by chance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1<italic>e</italic>-3). We conclude that the property of multifunctionality is conserved across orthologous genes of different organisms. This observation also supports the validity of our method for detecting multifunctional genes.</p>
<p>Functional annotations of genes are in part determined by transferring information between organisms via sequence similarity, and this could potentially confound our evolutionary analysis of multifunctionality. To address this, we repeat the analysis excluding GO annotations based on sequence or structural similarity and observe the same trends (see Section S1.3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s001">S1 Text</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s015">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>For human, we call essential all genes that have a mouse ortholog with a lethal phenotype (according to MGI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref041">41</xref>]). We find that 53% of multifunctional genes are essential, whereas only 42% of other genes are (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 7<italic>e</italic>-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Using data from a genome-wide RNAi screen in human mammary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref042">42</xref>], we also observe that multifunctional genes are essential significantly more often (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 1<italic>e</italic>-34; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). In a more detailed analysis using quantitative data about essentiality in 72 human cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref044">44</xref>], we confirm that in all 72 cell lines, multifunctional genes tend to be more essential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Gene essentiality has been found to correlate with evolutionary rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref046">46</xref>], and we observe that multifunctional genes tend to be more evolutionarily conserved; thus, the increased evolutionary conservation of multifunctional genes could potentially explain their preferential essentiality. We confirm that whether a gene is essential is correlated with its evolutionary conservation, but observe that multifunctional genes are still significantly more essential when controlling for evolutionary conservation (see Section 1.4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We note, however, that the relationship between multifunctionality and evolutionary conservation becomes much weaker when controlling for essentiality, and thus the tendency of essential genes to be more evolutionarily conserved may indeed explain the tendency of multifunctional genes to be more evolutionarily conserved (see Section 1.4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s001">S1 Text</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to fly and human, for yeast, when using information about essentiality for growth in rich medium, we do not observe a significant difference in essentiality: 24% of multifunctional genes and 26% of other annotated genes are essential (<italic>p</italic> = 0.11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g006">Fig 6E</xref>).

<p>To further investigate the relationship between multifunctional genes and their involvement in human disorders, we look at genes involved in multiple distinct disorders. We map OMIM terms onto the Disease Ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref049">49</xref>] and identify genes with at least one pair of disjoint OMIM terms (i.e., diseases that fall into separate branches of the Disease Ontology). We consider these genes to be involved in two or more distinct diseases. When considering genes involved in at least one disease from the Disease Ontology, we find that 18% of multifunctional genes are involved in at least two diseases, while only 8% of other such genes are involved in at least two diseases (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 4<italic>e</italic>-8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>One might expect that genes involved in more disorders, as well as multifunctional genes, are more actively studied by the research community, and that this could potentially introduce a study bias affecting our observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref012">12</xref>]. Using the number of PubMed publications associated with a gene as a proxy for how well studied it is, we indeed confirm that multifunctional genes are more actively studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s005">S4 Fig</xref>); however, even when only comparing gene sets with the same number of associated publications, we observe that the fraction of genes associated with disease is higher for multifunctional genes than for other genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s006">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Multifunctional genes tend to be more central in protein interaction networks</title>
<p>Genes associated with multiple functions may potentially play a more central role in the global functional organization of the cell. Large-scale networks of physical protein-protein interactions provide a comprehensive view of the cellular functional landscape. In order to study how multifunctional genes are positioned in protein interaction networks, we use interaction data curated by BioGRID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref039">39</xref>]. We use three measures of centrality: degree, betweenness centrality, and participation coefficient. Degree is the number of interactions in which a protein is involved. Betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths passing through a node in the network, and nodes with higher betweenness are more globally central in the network. Participation coefficient shows how well a protein’s interacting partners are distributed among clusters in the network, so that proteins with low participation are mostly interacting with proteins from the same cluster, whereas proteins with high participation have their interactions spread across many clusters.</p>
<p>We observe that with respect to all three considered measures, multifunctional genes are significantly more central than other genes (<italic>p</italic>-values from 2<italic>e</italic>-13 to 3<italic>e</italic>-50, Mann–Whitney U; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004467.g008">Fig 8</xref>).

Furthermore, in order to show that potential bias in the selection of baits in these high-throughput experiments does not affect our conclusions, we compare only the number of bait-to-prey interactions reported in these high-throughput experiments. In particular, we only compare multifunctional and other genes that are baits in these experiments, and observe the same trends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). Overall, we conclude that multifunctional genes are more centrally positioned in protein interaction networks, and this suggests that they may play an intermodular role within interactomes.</p>

<title>Same observations for multifunctionality defined with respect to molecular functions instead of biological processes</title>
<p>The main focus of our analysis thus far has been on multifunctional genes detected using the Biological Process ontology. However, the same procedure for detecting multifunctional genes can be applied to the Molecular Function ontology instead, thereby providing an orthogonal view of gene multifunctionality. For clarity, in this section we call the genes detected as multifunctional using the Biological Process ontology as BP-multifunctional and those detected as multifunctional using the Molecular Function ontology as MF-multifunctional.</p>
<p>We identify sets of MF-multifunctional genes for each organism and observe that MF-multifunctional genes have the same distinct biological properties when compared with other annotated genes as has been reported in the previous sections for BP-multifunctional genes (although some <italic>p</italic>-values for yeast are above our significance threshold of 5%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s009">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s010">S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s011">S10</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>In order to see if the involvement of a gene in multiple biological processes (BP-multifunctional) can be explained by multiple functions of the gene at the molecular level (MF-multifunctional), we directly compare the two sets of multifunctional genes derived from the two ontologies. We observe that 12% to 35% of BP-multifunctional genes are also MF-multifunctional, which constitutes a significant overlap (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 6<italic>e</italic>-18; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s018">S3 Table</xref>), while the remainder may potentially be explained by other modes of gene multifunctionality. In contrast, a gene involved in multiple molecular functions might be expected to have these molecular functions while performing different biological processes, and indeed most MF-multifunctional genes are also BP-multifunctional (56% to 78%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s019">S4 Table</xref>). These results are consistent with previous observations made using a simpler multifunctionality definition counting leaf GO terms associated with each protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref015">15</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most proteins are—at least to some extent—multifunctional. Even within this context, previous experimental studies have identified proteins that perform remarkably different molecular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref006">6</xref>], or that affect several distinct biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref010">10</xref>]. These findings suggest the existence of a subset of genes that are endowed with a particularly high degree of functional plasticity. There is increasing evidence that the phenomenon of gene multifunctionality is actually very common; thus, studying multifunctionality at a systems level can help elucidate the functional organization of the cell. In this paper, we introduce a computational approach to systematically identify multifunctional genes using existing functional annotations, and show that multifunctional genes are characterized by distinct properties as compared to other genes. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the largest-scale characterization of gene multifunctionality to date, with whole-genome analysis across several organisms.</p>
<p>As compared to other studies, our approach specifically addresses some previous weaknesses in handling GO functional annotations. In several previous publications, a simple count of the number of GO terms annotating a gene was used as a proxy for gene multifunctionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref019">19</xref>]. However, idiosyncrasies of GO may result in similar functions or processes being categorized in distinct places in the ontology. In our approach to identify multifunctional genes, we explicitly select semantically distinct terms that co-occur less frequently than expected by chance. Special care is also taken in gauging the effects of study bias, particularly in the case of interaction network properties and disease genes; that is, multifunctional genes may appear more often in the results of various experiments and thus be more actively studied by researchers, and this could potentially introduce a study bias in our analysis. In order to avoid this, we mostly analyze high-throughput and whole-genome data sets. When looking at associations of multifunctional genes with manually curated data (e.g., association with diseases), which could potentially suffer from study bias, we directly correct for this bias. Further, we carry out inter-species comparisons, and observe similar trends across three different organisms, thereby minimizing the effects of organism-specific annotation biases.</p>
<p>A remaining challenge in characterizing multifunctional genes at the genome-wide level is that current knowledge about gene function is far from complete; thus, new experimental information about the function of some genes could result in their reclassification as multifunctional. In the limit, we may expect that nearly all genes are, to varying degrees, multifunctional. Nevertheless, the robustness of our results—both across a diverse set of organisms with distinct functional annotations and biases as well as within a single organism when explicitly controlling for study bias—suggests that we have identified specific biological features that are associated with the degree of functional plasticity of a gene.</p>
<p>We find that gene multifunctionality is associated with several distinct properties that have important functional consequences. In the protein interactome, multifunctional proteins have a tendency to occupy more central and intermodular regions, even after controlling for potential study bias; this suggests that multifunctional proteins connect distinct and more specialized parts of the interactome, and are critical for information flow within the cell. Consistent with their important role within the cell, we also observe that multifunctional genes are more likely to be essential and are more often found to be associated with diseases. At the expression level, multifunctional genes are more broadly expressed across different conditions or cell types than are other genes. It is therefore possible that only subsets of functions are performed by multifunctional proteins under specific conditions or in particular cell types. We also observe that the expression of multifunctional genes appears to be finely regulated, as it involves a larger number of transcription factors than expected. At the molecular level, we find that multifunctional proteins have a larger number of unique domains as compared to other proteins; this is consistent with the wider spectrum of functions that they carry out. However, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref025">25</xref>], we also find that multifunctional proteins have a higher degree of structural disorder. Determining which of these properties or combinations of properties represent the main mechanism underlying the functional plasticity of a gene is of great interest. It is also possible to speculate that multifunctionality may be achieved via class-specific mechanisms where certain mechanisms may be at play only for a given class of genes.</p>
<p>As part of our analysis, we perform a cross-genomic analysis of gene multifunctionality. We find that multifunctional genes are more evolutionarily conserved than other genes; this may be due to their being under stronger evolutionary pressure as they perform multiple functions, with different functions potentially performed in different conditions. Further, orthologous genes tend to share their propensity for multifunctionality; this suggests that the multifunctionality of many genes may have an early evolutionary origin. It also further supports the validity of our method to detect multifunctional genes, as they are uncovered in each organism independently.</p>
<p>Our method to detect genes annotated with distinct functional terms can be applied to any of the vocabularies in GO, and this allows us to look at the phenomenon of gene multifunctionality from different perspectives. We observe, not surprisingly, that most genes identified as being involved in multiple molecular functions are also identified as participating in multiple biological processes. However, we detect many genes involved in multiple biological processes for which there is no evidence of association with multiple molecular functions. While this may be partly due to the fewer number of molecular function annotations, it also suggests that these genes may perform the same molecular function while carrying out different biological processes, depending upon a spatio-temporal context. Being able to tease apart the conditions under which a specific function is performed by a gene is an important avenue for future research in functional genomics, and could even lead to the development of a context-specific GO vocabulary. In this ontology, the terms used to annotate genes could be qualified with other terms specifying the cell type, the developmental stage, or the stage in the cell-cycle in which a given function is most likely to be carried out by a gene.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of gene and protein function has been a major goal of computational biology since the emergence of the field. In this work, we develop a computational method for genome-wide detection of multifunctional genes using existing functional annotations. We make a number of novel observations about gene multifunctionality across several organisms, as well as confirm some previous findings (including many cases where only anecdotal evidence existed). Overall, our work contributes to a better systematic understanding of the functional landscape of the proteome, and can be the basis for future work in this direction as more specific and detailed functional genomics data become available.</p>

<title>Multifunctional genes</title>
<p>Gene Ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref022">22</xref>] terms and gene association data for each organism were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org/</ext-link> on July 12, 2013. For the main analysis reported in the paper, we include all functional associations with evidence codes EXP (“Inferred from Experiment”), IDA (“Inferred from Direct Assay”), IMP (“Inferred from Mutant Phenotype”), IGI (“Inferred from Genetic Interaction”), IEP (“Inferred from Expression Pattern”), ISS (“Inferred from Sequence or structural Similarity”), ISO (“Inferred from Sequence Orthology”), ISA (“Inferred from Sequence Alignment”), ISM (“Inferred from Sequence Model”), IGC (“Inferred from Genomic Context”), IBA (“Inferred from Biological aspect of Ancestor”), IC (“Inferred by Curator”), TAS (“Traceable Author Statement”), and NAS (“Non-traceable Author Statement”). We exclude all annotations with the qualifier NOT. We also perform additional analyses restricting ourselves to GO annotations with evidence codes EXP, IDA, IMP, IEP, IC, and TAS; these results are consistent with those reported in the main body of the paper (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s012">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s013">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s014">S13</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s025">S6 File</xref>). For all GO analysis, we use code from the project goatools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools">https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We call multifunctional every gene that is annotated with at least “two sufficiently distinct functional terms of comparable specificity,” as explained next. First, to define terms of about equal specificity, we start with the notion of informative terms used previously in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref054">54</xref>], which selects for a given <italic>N</italic> all terms that annotate ≥ <italic>N</italic> genes, but whose descendant terms annotate &lt; <italic>N</italic> genes. However, we observe that a very general term annotating many genes may have all descendant terms annotating only small numbers of genes, even if it annotates many more than <italic>N</italic> genes. For example, a fly term <monospace>imaginal disc-derived wing morphogenesis</monospace> (<monospace>GO:0007476</monospace>) annotates 508 genes, but its descendant terms annotate no more than 82 genes each (248 genes in total), and it may be undesirable to call this term informative for <italic>N</italic> ≈ 100, as it is actually a much more general term than terms that annotate approximately 100 genes. To overcome this problem, we select the set <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> of all terms which annotate ≥ <italic>N</italic> genes, but &lt; 2<italic>N</italic> genes, and whose every descendant term annotates &lt; <italic>N</italic> genes (this includes terms with no descendants). Next, from all genes annotated by terms from <italic>T<sub>N</sub></italic> we extract the genes annotated with at least two such terms. In order to consider annotations by distinct terms only, from the collection of all pairs of selected terms {(<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>): <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> ∈ <italic>T<sub>N</sub></italic>}, we further select pairs of terms that are sufficiently distinct. First, we filter out pairs of terms that have a common descendant term, as this may be an indication of similarity between the terms. We also remove all pairs of terms that have pairwise semantic similarity larger than zero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref055">55</xref>]; though alternate thresholds of semantic similarity could be used, here we select only pairs of terms whose least common ancestor is the root of the ontology. Finally, terms annotating similar sets of genes may correspond to similar functions, so we filter out all pairs of terms that annotate significantly overlapping sets of genes (hypergeometric test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1). A gene co-annotated by some pair of selected terms from <italic>T<sub>N</sub></italic> passing these filters is called multifunctional. In order to focus on more specific biological process terms and avoid considering less informative (i.e., more general) terms annotating a lot of genes, we require that <italic>N</italic> is not greater than a certain threshold <italic>M</italic>; we choose <italic>M</italic> = 120 for the analysis in the main text. The final set of multifunctional genes is given by the union of all sets obtained for different <italic>N</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> ranges from 10 up to <italic>M</italic>, with an increment of 10. We compare multifunctional genes with all other genes that are annotated with any selected term from <italic>T<sub>N</sub></italic> for <italic>N</italic> between 10 and <italic>M</italic> (with an increment of 10). We show that, for all our results, the same trends are observed when varying the parameter <italic>M</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s023">S4 File</xref>), the <italic>p</italic>-value threshold in co-annotation filter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s024">S5 File</xref>), and when restricting the analysis to a subset of the most reliable GO annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s012">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s013">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s014">S13</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004467.s025">S6 File</xref>).</p>

<p>The proteomes of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were downloaded from UniProt (September 2013 release). For each protein encoded by a gene, we compute its amino acid sequence length, number of domains and average disorder as follows. For fly and human, we consider the longest protein isoform encoded by a gene (for yeast, there is only one isoform per gene in the database). Domain information was obtained from Pfam 27.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref056">56</xref>], using the annotations contained in the swisspfam file. For each protein sequence, the number of unique protein domain families found within it is computed; that is, multiple instances of the same domain family are ignored. Predictions of disordered residues are carried out using the IUPred program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref027">27</xref>], with default parameters. The average disorder of the protein is then computed as the fraction of residues with a IUPred score above 0.5, as suggested by the authors.</p>

<title>Essentiality</title>
<p>Phenotype data were obtained for fly (FlyBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref030">30</xref>], version v2013_07), mouse (MGI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref041">41</xref>], downloaded October 3, 2013), and yeast (from YeastMine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref063">63</xref>], downloaded September 26, 2013). Essential genes are defined as genes with a “lethal” phenotype for fly and with an “inviable” phenotype for yeast. For human, genes are deemed essential if their mouse orthologs (as reported by MGI) have associated with them any phenotype containing “lethal” in its name. When applying a hypergeometric test for enrichment of essential genes in multifunctional genes, the set of all genes with any reported phenotype is used as a background. In addition, sets of essential genes detected in genome-wide RNAi screens in cell lines were obtained from OGEE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref064">64</xref>] for fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref040">40</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref042">42</xref>].

Out of the 9664 human genes annotated with at least one GO term used in the definition of multifunctionality (see Subsection <bold>Multifunctional genes</bold>), 2299 had at least one OMIM association. To further probe the similarities between diseases involving the same genes, we used the Disease Ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004467.ref049">49</xref>], a knowledgebase of human disorders that are hierarchically organized in a directed acyclic graph. We mapped OMIM terms to Disease Ontology terms using the OBO file available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://disease-ontology.org/downloads">http://disease-ontology.org/downloads</ext-link>. Out of 2299 genes with an OMIM association, 1148 have at least one Disease Ontology term. We focus on genes with at least one Disease Ontology term, and extract from them all genes that have at least two Disease Ontology terms with only the root node in common; this results in 135 genes, which we consider as genes associated with at least two distinct diseases.</p>

To assess significance, we repeat the computation 1000 times with randomization. In each random trial, we permute the labels of multifunctional and other annotated genes within each organism, while considering only genes involved in orthologous relationships.
