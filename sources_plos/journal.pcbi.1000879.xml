<p>Working memory (WM) is the part of the brain's memory system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of information necessary for cognition. Although WM has limited capacity at any given time, it has vast memory content in the sense that it acts on the brain's nearly infinite repertoire of lifetime long-term memories. Using simulations, we show that large memory content and WM functionality emerge spontaneously if we take the spike-timing nature of neuronal processing into account. Here, memories are represented by extensively overlapping groups of neurons that exhibit stereotypical time-locked spatiotemporal spike-timing patterns, called <italic>polychronous</italic> patterns; and synapses forming such <italic>polychronous</italic> neuronal groups (PNGs) are subject to associative synaptic plasticity in the form of both long-term and short-term spike-timing dependent plasticity. While long-term potentiation is essential in PNG formation, we show how short-term plasticity can temporarily strengthen the synapses of selected PNGs and lead to an increase in the spontaneous reactivation rate of these PNGs. This increased reactivation rate, consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings during WM tasks, results in high interspike interval variability and irregular, yet systematically changing, elevated firing rate profiles within the neurons of the selected PNGs. Additionally, our theory explains the relationship between such slowly changing firing rates and precisely timed spikes, and it reveals a novel relationship between WM and the perception of time on the order of seconds.</p>

<p>Working memory (WM) is the part of the brain's vast memory system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of the information necessary for complex cognitive tasks, such as language comprehension, learning, and reasoning. Despite extensive neuroscience research, its mechanism is not clearly understood. We exploit a well-known feature of the brain — its ability to use precisely timed spiking events in its operation — to show how working memory functionality can emerge in the brain's vast memory repertoire. Our neural simulations explain many features of neural activity observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during working memory tasks, previously thought to be unrelated, and our results point to a relationship between working memory and other mental functions such as perception of time. This work contributes to our understanding of these brain functions and, by giving testable predictions, has the potential to impact the broader neuroscience research field.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Various mechanisms have been proposed to model the main aspect of neural activity — elevated firing rates of a cue-specific population of neurons — observed during the delay period of a working memory (WM) task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Fuster1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Baddeley2">[4]</xref>. These include reentrant spiking activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Zipser1">[5]</xref>, intrinsic membrane currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Marder1">[6]</xref>, NMDA currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Hempel1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Wang2">[10]</xref>, and short-term synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Hempel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Mongillo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-SugaseMiyamoto1">[12]</xref>. These mechanisms, however, fail to explain other aspects of neural correlates of WM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Barbieri1">[13]</xref>, and they have been demonstrated to work only with a limited memory content where the number of items represented in long-term memory is small, i.e., they hold in WM a few items (limited capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Miller1">[14]</xref>) out of only a conceivable few (limited memory content). Memories in these simulated networks are often represented by carefully selected, largely non-overlapping groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Edelman1">[15]</xref> of spiking neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Mongillo1">[11]</xref>. Indeed, extending the memory content in such networks increases the overlap between the memory representations (unless the size of the network is increased, too), and activation of one representation spreads to others, resulting in uncontrollable epileptic-like “runaway excitation”. The narrow memory content is at odds with experimental findings that neurons participate in many different neural circuits (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Hebb1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Harris1">[18]</xref>) and, therefore, are part of many distinct representations that form a vast memory content for WM. These limitations may be overcome by a model that accounts for the precise spike-timing nature of neural processing.</p>
<p>We propose a model in which memories are represented by extensively overlapping neuronal groups that exhibit stereotypical time-locked, but not necessarily synchronous, firing patterns called <italic>polychronous</italic> patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich1">[19]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Hopfield1">[20]</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we use a small network to illustrate this concept: Two distinct patterns of synaptic connections (red and black connections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>) with appropriate axonal conduction delays form two distinct <italic>polychronous</italic> neuronal groups (PNGs). Notice that these PNGs are defined by distinct patterns of synapses, and not by the neurons <italic>per se</italic>, which allows the neurons to take part in multiple PNGs and enables the same set of neurons to generate distinct stereotypical time-locked spatiotemporal spike-timing patterns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). PNGs arise spontaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich2">[21]</xref> in simulated realistic cortical spiking networks shaped by spike-timing dependent plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Markram1">[22]</xref> (STDP).</p>

<title>Illustration of <italic>polychronous</italic> neuronal groups and associative short-term plasticity.</title>
<p>(A) Synaptic connections between neurons <italic>n</italic>1, <italic>n</italic>2, …, <italic>n</italic>7 have different axonal conduction delays arranged such that the network forms two functional subnetworks, red and black, corresponding to two distinct PNGs, consisting of the same neurons. Firing of neurons <italic>n</italic>1 and <italic>n</italic>2 can trigger the whole red or black PNG: (B) If neuron <italic>n</italic>1 fires followed by neuron <italic>n</italic>2 10 ms later, then the spiking activity will start propagating along the red subnetwork, resulting in the precisely timed, i.e., <italic>polychronous</italic>, firing sequence of neurons <italic>n</italic>3,<italic>n</italic>4,<italic>n</italic>5,<italic>n</italic>6,<italic>n</italic>7, and in the short-term potentiation of the red synapses. (C) If neurons <italic>n</italic>2 and <italic>n</italic>1 fire in reverse order with the appropriate timings, activity will propagate along the black subnetwork making the same set of neurons fire but in a different order: <italic>n</italic>7,<italic>n</italic>5,<italic>n</italic>3,<italic>n</italic>6,<italic>n</italic>4, which temporarily strengthens the black synapses. Readout: post-synaptic neurons that receive weak connections from neurons n3, n4, and n5 with long delays and from neurons n6 and n7 with shorter delays (or, alternatively, briefly excited by the activity of the former and slowly inhibited by the latter) will fire selectively when the red <italic>polychronous</italic> pattern is activated, and hence could serve as an appropriate readout of the red subnetwork. A similar readout mechanism is illustrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Buonomano1">[53]</xref>.</p>

<p>Another distinctive feature of our theory is that synaptic efficacies are subject to associative short-term changes, that is, changes that depend on the conjunction of pre- and post-synaptic activity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Brenowitz1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Erickson1">[25]</xref> for experimental findings supporting this postulation). We simulated two different mechanisms: (1) associative short-term synaptic plasticity via short-term STDP, where short-term synaptic changes — that decay to baseline within a few seconds — are induced by the classical STDP protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g002">Figure 2A</xref>); and (2) the short-term amplification of synaptic responses via simulated NMDA spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Lisman1">[8]</xref> at the corresponding dendritic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g002">Figure 2B–2D</xref>). The latter mechanism is also pre- and postsynaptic activity dependent: Pre-synaptic spikes alone activate postsynaptic NMDA receptors, yet only generate small excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) at the dendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, red trace) because of the magnesium block of the NMDA receptors. Postsynaptic spikes, however, induce dendritic membrane potential depolarization and removal of the magnesium block. Hence, the dendritic compartment flips into up-state. While in the up-state, each presynaptic spike results in a large-amplitude response (often called an NMDA spike) that can propagate from the dendritic compartment to the soma and enhance the efficacy of synaptic transmission in eliciting somatic spikes. The short-term enhancement of synaptic efficacy is similar to that recorded in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Schiller1">[26]</xref> and in detailed simulations of Hodgkin-Huxley-type conductance-based models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Rhodes1">[27]</xref>. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g002">Figure 2B–2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details.)</p>

<p>(A) The synaptic change is triggered by the classical STDP protocol at time “stimulation” (marked by arrows) but the change decays to 0 (baseline) within a few seconds. Left panel shows that firing of only pre- or post-synaptic neurons does not trigger any synaptic change. The middle panel illustrates that firing in the order pre-before-post induces short-term augmentation, as opposed to the post-before-pre (Right panel) resulting in short-term depression. (B–C) Short-term amplification of synaptic responses via simulated NMDA receptors resulting in NMDA spikes. (B) Schematic diagram showing a multi-compartmental neuron (post) receiving a synapse from a pre-synaptic neuron (pre). (C) A train of presynaptic spikes is followed by a postsynaptic response delayed by 10 ms and caused by other synaptic inputs. Each pre-synaptic spike activates postsynaptic NMDA receptors and deactivates with time constant of 250 ms. (D) Persistent pre-then-post train of action potentials flips the dendritic compartment into up-state. While in the up-state, each pre-synaptic spike results in a large-amplitude dendritic excitatory postsynaptic potential (black trace <italic>V</italic> (dendritic)), often called NMDA spike, that can propagate to the soma and enhance the efficacy of the synaptic transmission in eliciting somatic spike. The red trace shows the control simulation when the post-synaptic spikes are absent: No significant increase in synaptic efficacy is observed in this case. Similarly, post-before-pre patterns do not result in significant enhancement of synaptic transmission unless the timing is such that there is a residual depolarization when pre-synaptic spike arrives, or there is a residual glutamate in synaptic cleft from the previous pre-spike when post neuron fired. The voltage traces in sub-panel (D) are simulations of a passive dendritic compartment with voltage-dependent NMDA conductance.</p>

<p>We found that the exact form of such short-term synaptic changes is not important for the WM functionality presented in this paper (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>), as long as these changes selectively affect synapses according to the relative spike timing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. For example, activation of the red PNG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g001">Figure 1</xref> temporarily potentiates the red synapses and not the black ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). This differs from the standard short-term synaptic facilitation or augmentation used in previous WM models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Hempel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Mongillo1">[11]</xref>, which are not associative, and hence non-selectively affect all synapses belonging to the same presynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>In the model presented here, PNGs get spontaneously reactivated due to stochastic synaptic noise. Short-term strengthening of the synapses of selected PNGs can bias these reactivations, i.e., increase the reactivation rate of the selected PNGs, which results in activity patterns similar to those observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during WM tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Fuster1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Baddeley2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Barbieri1">[13]</xref>. Additionally, even though PNGs share neurons with other PNGs, the activity of one PNG does not spread to the others. Therefore, frequent reactivation of a selected PNG does not initiate uncontrollable activity in the network. In this way, the WM mechanism presented here can work in finite networks with large memory content. This is different from previous models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Mongillo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Amit1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Roudi1">[31]</xref> where large memory content and maintenance of several memory items can only be achieved by a drastic increase in the size of the network or the number of connections between neurons.</p>

<title>The Simulated Network</title>
<p>We implemented our model in a simulated network of 1000 spiking neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich3">[32]</xref>, where 80% of the neurons are regular spiking pyramidal neurons and 20% are GABAergic fast spiking interneurons. The probability that any pair of neurons are connected equals 0.1. Excitatory synaptic connections have a random distribution of axonal conduction delays in the [1…20] ms range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Swadlow1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Swadlow3">[35]</xref>. Excitatory synaptic efficacy is subject to both associative short-term plasticity and long-term STDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Markram1">[22]</xref>. Maximum synaptic strengths are set so that three simultaneously arriving pre-synaptic spikes are needed to reliably elicit a post-synaptic spike. (The <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section has detailed description of the network, neuron model, and synaptic plasticity.) Approximately 8000 strongly overlapping PNGs emerge spontaneously in such network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and we select a few to demonstrate how these mechanisms (PNG formation and associative short-term plasticity) can serve to maintain WM, and how they can account for the other related experimental findings.</p>

<title>One Cue in Working Memory</title>
<p>To initiate sustained neuronal activity that characterizes WM, we select (cue) a random PNG and stimulate its neurons in the sequence that characterizes the PNG's <italic>polychronous</italic> pattern. That is, we stimulate the intra-PNG neurons sequentially with the appropriate <italic>polychronous</italic> pattern 10 times during a one second interval (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) to temporarily increase the intra-PNG synaptic efficacy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The red dots in the spike raster in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4A</xref> indicate spikes of the selected target PNG. The initial stimulation of the target PNG resulted in short-term strengthening of the intra-PNG synapses via associative short-term plasticity, but had little effect on the other synapses in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, “short-term synaptic change” curves). Upon termination of the stimulation, the temporarily facilitated intra-PNG synapses and the noisy synaptic inputs resulted in sporadic reactivations of different segments of the target PNG, often leading to the reactivation of the rest of the <italic>polychronous</italic> sequence (seen as red vertical stripes in the raster in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and magnified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Each such reactivation of the target PNG triggers further strengthening of its synapses, thereby maintaining the target PNG in the active state for tens of seconds. Notably, the active maintenance of a PNG in WM does not depend on a reverberant/looping circuit, but it emerges as a result of the interplay between non-specific noise (which spontaneously triggers activation of PNGs) and short-term strengthening of the appropriate synapses (that makes subsequent reactivations of the target PNG more likely). There are frequent gaps of hundreds of milliseconds between spontaneous reactivations of the target PNG, clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, but occasional reactivation is necessary to maintain the PNG in WM. Without the reactivations, the initial short-term strengthening of intra-PNG synapses decays quickly (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, “decay without replay” curve). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4F</xref> shows that almost all of the thousands of emerged PNGs, if stimulated, remained activated for more then ten seconds in WM (average <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000879.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> seconds).</p>

<title>Precise Spike-Timing, Inter-Spike Interval Variability, and Functional Connectivity Changes during Working Memory Maintenance</title>
<p>Since spontaneous reactivations of the target PNG in WM are stochastic, timing of the spiking activity of each neuron in a PNG also looks random when considered in isolation. The coefficient of variation (CV) of inter-spike intervals (ISIs), i.e., the variability of ISIs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), is higher for individual intra-PNG neurons when the PNG is in WM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Compte1">[36]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This phenomenon is due to the systematically changing and non-stationary mean firing activities and mean ISIs of the intra-PNG neurons during replay (see section below). Relative intra-PNG timing at the millisecond timescale is, however, maintained during replay, as can be seen in the magnified spike rasters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">5C</xref>. This is a major feature that distinguishes our approach from earlier approaches that posit synchronous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Mongillo1">[11]</xref> or totally asynchronous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Hempel1">[7]</xref> spiking, and this feature allows our model to have a vast repertoire of overlapping PNGs, i.e., large memory content. Cross-correlograms (CCG) of simulated intra-PNG neuronal pairs also reveal the precisely timed nature of their spiking activity, as well as the context-dependent changes in functional connectivity linking these neurons: The red CCG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4D</xref> is recorded while the target PNG is in WM, and it has a peak around 5 ms, whereas the blue CCG (recorded later in a different session, when the PNG is not activated) is flat. A similar dependence of CCGs of spiking activity on the behavioral state of the network biased by sensory cues was reported in medial prefrontal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Fujisawa1">[37]</xref>.</p>

<title>Systematically Varying Persistent Firing Activity</title>
<p>The average multiunit firing rate of the neurons forming the target PNG following activation is around 4 Hz, much higher than that of the rest of the network, which is about 0.3 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, “multiunit firing rate” red vs. blue solid lines). The average firing rate histograms of most intra-PNG neurons show distinct temporal profiles that repeat from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s004">Figure S4</xref>): Some neurons only respond to the initial stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4E</xref> <italic>n</italic>392); some have ramping or decaying firing rates (<italic>n</italic>652); whereas others have their peak activity seconds after the stimulus offset (<italic>n</italic>559). Neurons that are not part of the target PNG show uniform low firing rate activity across the whole trial (<italic>n</italic>800). These systematically varying, persistent temporal firing profiles are similar to those observed experimentally <italic>in vivo</italic> in frontal cortex during the delay period of the WM task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Fuster1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Funahashi1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Brody1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Goldman1">[39]</xref>, but no previous spiking model of WM could reproduce them.</p>
<p>To get the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4E</xref>, only an initial segment of the target PNG is activated during the selection (cueing) process (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Therefore, only the synapses forming the initial segment of the target PNG get temporarily potentiated. Hence, directly after stimulation/cuing only the neurons in the initial segment of the target PNG get more frequently reactivated as propagation of activation along the PNG dies out somewhere in the middle of the PNG without activating the neurons at the back. As frequent spontaneous reactivations persist, more and more synapses undergo short-term STDP, and more and more neurons from the end of the target PNG start to participate in the reactivations. Activities of such neurons show ramping up firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4E</xref> <italic>n</italic>559). Conversely, neurons in the initial segment of the PNG may not participate in enough reactivations and, therefore, synapses to those neurons decay back to their baseline strength, resulting in a ramping down firing profile (<italic>n</italic>392 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In general, the slowly changing firing rates are generated by spontaneous incomplete activations within the target PNG: Neurons that are initially stimulated typically do not get reactivated or get reactivated only shortly after the target PNG stimulation and, therefore, exhibit ramping down firing profile (<italic>n</italic>392, <italic>n</italic>652); In contrast, those that join just later the wave of reactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s004">Figure S4E</xref>) express ramping up (and later down) firing activity (<italic>n</italic>559).</p>

<title>Multiple Cues in Working Memory</title>
<p>In a single network, multiple PNGs, i.e., multiple memories, can be loaded and maintained in WM simultaneously despite large overlap in their neuronal composition. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">Figure 5A</xref> we stimulate two PNGs sequentially (out of the thousands available PNGs). The target PNGs consisted of 220 and 191 neurons each, and have 66 neurons in common. The intra-PNG neurons, however, fire with different timings relative to the other neurons within each PNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">Figures 5C and 5D</xref>). Therefore, there is little or no interference, and both PNGs are simultaneously kept in WM for many seconds. The model can hold several items in WM but eventually its performance deteriorates with increased load (note the sub-linear histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">
<title>Novel Stimulus - Working Memory Expands Memory Content</title>
<p>To demonstrate that a novel cue can be loaded and kept in WM, we stimulated the network with a novel spike-timing pattern repeatedly every 15 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Notice that this spiking pattern — triggered by the novel external cue — did not correspond to any of the existing PNGs' firing pattern. Each time the new pattern is presented to the network, the synapses between the stimulated neurons that fire with the appropriate order are potentiated due to long-term STDP. In addition, synapses to some other post-synaptic neurons that were firing by chance and have synaptic connections with converging conduction delays that support appropriate spike timing, are also potentiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich1">[19]</xref>. Thus, the expansion of the network's memory content, i.e., the formation of a new PNG representing the novel cue, occurs via the interplay of long-term STDP and repeated firing of neurons with the right spatiotemporal pattern. This pattern can be triggered by stimulation (as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich1">[19]</xref>), or it could result from autonomous reactivations due to WM mechanism (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g006">Figure 6A and 6D</xref>). Therefore, the WM mechanism, by facilitating the reactivations of the new PNG, facilitates the formation of the new PNG. Despite that the new PNG consists both of neurons that received (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) and of neurons that did not receive (marked black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) direct stimulation during the cue presentations/learning, in order to load and keep the cue in WM it is sufficient to stimulate those neurons that were directly stimulated during learning. The reactivation rate of the new PNG, 4 Hz, is similar to those observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">5</xref>.</p>

<p>Results of our simulations are robust with respect to the mechanisms of associative short-term change of synaptic efficacies and to parameters of the model, such as short-term synaptic decay time constants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">5</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s001">Figure S1</xref>); probability of random synaptic inputs; or choice of the target PNGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">5</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s004">S4</xref>, where we replicate the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">5</xref> using PNGs that were manually generated and inserted in the network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>)).</p>
<p>The underlying currency of information in the theory presented here is the activation of a PNG. This, combined with an associative form of short-term changes of synaptic efficacies results in spontaneously emerging WM functionality: short-term synaptic changes bias the competition between PNG reactivations, and give rise to frequent spontaneous reactivations of the selected PNGs (relative to the reactivation rate of the other PNGs), which are expressed as short <italic>polychronous</italic> events with preserved intra-PNG spike-timings. The simulations result in a network with large memory content, and produce neural activity consistent with those observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Fuster1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Funahashi1">[3]</xref>.

The current remains on via positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), and the postsynaptic potential remains depolarized, as long as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000879.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is above certain lower threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000879.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>We assume here that each synapse has its own postsynaptic compartment with its own <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000879.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is independent from its neighbors. This conductance is increased by each arriving spike and exponentially decays with the time constant of 250 ms. To speed-up simulations of the network of 1000 neurons and to avoid having 100,000 compartments, we model the NMDA synapses via a hysteresis function: The synaptic efficacy is 10-fold tronger when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000879.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and there is a post-synaptic spike, and it returns to normal values when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000879.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This results in an associative short-term plasticity, as the strength of synaptic transmission between two neurons can be transiently increased if the post-synaptic neuron fires persistently after the pre-synaptic one.</p>

<title>Stimulating a PNG</title>
<p>To select a specific PNG in WM, i.e, to temporarily increase the intra-PNG synaptic efficacy, we transiently stimulate its neurons sequentially with the appropriate spatiotemporal spike-timing pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Johansson1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Gollisch1">[50]</xref>. What enters WM is possibly gated by attention. To avoid modeling attentional mechanisms, we provide two different gating implementations:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>Stimulate the intra-PNG neurons sequentially with the appropriate <italic>polychronous</italic> pattern 10 times during a one second interval (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">5A</xref>) to temporarily increase the intra-PNG synaptic efficacy. This simulates the arrival of visually evoked volleys of spikes due to several micro-saccades per second <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Gollisch1">[50]</xref>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>Stimulate the intra-PNG neurons sequentially with the appropriate <italic>polychronous</italic> pattern but only one to three times in the presence of elevated level of a simulated neuromodulator, e.g., dopamine, that increases the synaptic plasticity rate (as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This stimulation mechanism results in a 5-fold faster rate of change of synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-Seamans1">[51]</xref>. Dopaminergic regulation of prefrontal cortex activity is essential for cognitive functions such as working memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000879-GoldmanRakic1">[52]</xref>. Elevated neuromodulator level in this implementation increases the level of sensitivity of WM to the current stimulus.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>We also performed stochastic stimulations (for both types of stimulations) where the firing response probability of individual neurons to external stimulation was smaller then 1 and found the qualitative behavior of the network to be similar. For example, the response probability for the target neurons in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s002">Figure S2</xref> is 0.8.</p>
<p>For the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4E</xref> (and 6), and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s004">S4</xref>, not all the neurons of the target PNG were stimulated (with the appropriate <italic>polychronous</italic> pattern) but only the initial segment of the target PNGs (80 percent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4E</xref>; 10 percent in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s004">S4</xref>).

</sec><sec id="s4g">
<title>Non-Specific Input to the Network</title>
<p>Throughout the whole simulation the network is stimulated with stochastic miniature synaptic potentials (called “minis”), and it exhibits asynchronous noisy spiking activity. The average background multiunit firing rate is around 0.3 Hz for the simulations presented in the article. Qualitative behavior of the network is similar to a wide range of noisy background firing activity, which, however, cannot be too small, as some background activity is necessary to initiate spontaneous PNG reactivations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s005">Figure S5</xref>), or too high, as that would interfere with neural activity propagation within the PNG.</p>
<p>Spontaneously emerging PNGs in the simple network we used tend to be prone to noise. This means that the initiated activity in the PNG is less likely to propagate along the whole PNG in the presence of high background noise (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000879.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for excitatory neurons). This is because neurons that should respond (fire) to presynaptic activity and pass that activity to postsynaptic intra-PNG neurons are likely to be inhibited or be in their refractory period if there is too much background activity present in the network.</p>
<p>Manually inserted PNGs can be engineered to have redundant connections, i.e, postsynaptic neurons have more presynaptic connections (from multiple presynaptic neurons) than minimally required to fire these postsynaptic neurons. This redundancy can make these PNGs much more robust to noise: the inability of a presynaptic neuron to fire (e.g. due to inhibition) is less likely to prevent the propagation of activity in the PNG, as there are likely other presynaptic intra-PNG neurons firing and passing the activity to the same postsynaptic target.</p>

<title>CV - Variability of Inter-Spike Intervals</title>

<p>Maintenance of multiple representations in working memory in a network with 100 embedded PNGs. The spike raster shows only excitatory neurons participating in neuronal groups A<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>92</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and A<sub>2</sub>. Activation of each such neuronal group, involving more than 25 percent of its neurons is marked by spikes of different color. Insets show raster plots corresponding to partial activation of various neuronal groups. Circles show where the spikes are expected, black dots show the actual spikes. The network exhibits spontaneous activity except at 0 second (stimulation of the first ten neurons belonging to A<sub>1</sub>) and 10 seconds (stimulation of the first ten neurons belonging to A<sub>2</sub>). If a few neurons forming the i<sup>th</sup> PNG, A<sub>i</sub>, fire with the appropriate spike-timing, the rest of the neuronal group responds with the corresponding polychronous firing pattern. For example, the left two inserts show spontaneous activation of A<sub>13</sub> and A<sub>92</sub>. To select a PNG to be held in working memory we activate it by an appropriate sensory input. For example, at time 0 seconds we stimulated the first 10 neurons of the sequence A<sub>1</sub> with the appropriate timing 10 times per second during the interval of 1 second. (Notice that the first four stimulations are not colored as less then 25 percent of the A<sub>1</sub> was activated.) This stimulation resulted in short-term strengthening of the synaptic connections forming the initial segment of A<sub>1</sub> via short-term STDP, but had little effect on the other synapses. Upon termination of the simulated applied input, the strengthened intra-group connectivity resulted in the spontaneous reactivation of the initial segment of A<sub>1</sub> with the precise timing of spikes (3<sup>rd</sup> inset), leading often to the activation of the rest of the sequence (marked by red dots). Each such spontaneous reactivation of A<sub>1</sub> results in further strengthening of the synaptic connectivity forming A<sub>1</sub>, thereby maintaining A<sub>1</sub> in the “active” state for tens of seconds. Notice that such an active maintenance is accomplished without any recurrent excitation. Even though each neuron in A<sub>1</sub> fires with a precise timing with respect to the other neurons in the PNG, the activity of the neuron looks random. To illustrate maintenance of multiple memory representations in working memory, we stimulate the initial segment of group A<sub>2</sub> with a 10 Hz 1 sec long specific excitatory drive. Even though the neuronal groups A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> partially overlap, the neurons fire with different timings relative to the other neurons within each group, so there is little or no interference, and both representations are kept in working memory for many seconds.</p>

<p>Systematically changing persistent firing rates during working memory tasks. Spike rasters and mean (over several trials) firing rates of neurons at the beginning (A), middle (B) and the end (C) of the polychronous sequence forming the neuronal group A<sub>1</sub> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and a control neuron (D) not belonging to the PNG. Arrow marks the trigger stimulus. The firing rates of these neurons have stereotypical profiles that are reproducible from trial to trial (as are often those observed experimentally. Sensory stimuli were needed to activate only the initial part of the corresponding PNG (network noise prevents full activation of the sequence), resulting in high firing rate in A, but low initial rates in B and C. Subsequent spontaneous reactivations resulted in stronger synapses and in longer sequences (insets in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s003">Figure S3</xref>) leading to the steady increase in the firing rates (B and C lower panel). Often, reactivation starts in the middle of the sequence, thereby strengthening synapses downstream but not affecting synapses upstream of the sequence. Eventually, the synaptic connections forming the initial segment become weaker and that part of the neuronal group stops reactivating, resulting in the decline in the firing rate as seen in A and then in B. (E) Neurons in A<sub>1</sub> are sorted according to their relative spike-timing within the polychronous sequence and show a single trial spike raster. A slowly traveling wave (moving hot spot) of increased firing rates is generated by spontaneous incomplete activations within A<sub>1</sub>. This wave could provide a timing signal to a separate brain region to execute a behavior or a sequence of behaviors locked to the onset of the trigger stimulus. For example, a motor neuron circuit that needs to execute a motor action 10 seconds after the trigger should have strong connections from neurons 20 through 30 from the neuronal group, but be inhibited by the activity of neurons 1 through 20. A sequence of behaviors could be executed by potentiating connections from multiple subsets of the neuronal group to multiple motor-neuron circuits (e.g., via dopamine-modulated STDP [Izhikevich E.M., 2007, Solving the distal reward problem through linkage of stdp and dopamine signaling. Cereb Cortex 17: 2443–52.]). Similarly, activations of multiple representations in short-term memory, as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000879.s003">Figure S3</xref> (sec&gt;15) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figure 4</xref> (main text), would implement multiple clocks and multiple sequences of actions.</p>

<p>Interrupting the replay of PNGs maintained in WM. Working memory functionality in our model emerges via the interplay between spontaneous synaptic input (minis) and short-term synaptic plasticity. Blocking the minis or diminishing the effect of short-term plasticity can interrupt the replay process, which provides a mechanism to remove an item from WM. Spike raster and firing rate plots as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000879-g005">5</xref> of main text. At time 5 seconds, as an effect of change in a simulated neuromodulator level, the short-term plasticity rate fades and, therefore, the reactivation of the target PNG stops and the strength of synapses of the target PNG decay to their baseline.</p>
