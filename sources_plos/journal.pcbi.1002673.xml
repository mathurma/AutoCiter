        <p>Social contact patterns among individuals encode the transmission route of infectious diseases and are a key ingredient in the realistic characterization and modeling of epidemics. Unfortunately, the gathering of high quality experimental data on contact patterns in human populations is a very difficult task even at the coarse level of mixing patterns among age groups. Here we propose an alternative route to the estimation of mixing patterns that relies on the construction of virtual populations parametrized with highly detailed census and demographic data. We present the modeling of the population of 26 European countries and the generation of the corresponding synthetic contact matrices among the population age groups. The method is validated by a detailed comparison with the matrices obtained in six European countries by the most extensive survey study on mixing patterns. The methodology presented here allows a large scale comparison of mixing patterns in Europe, highlighting general common features as well as country-specific differences. We find clear relations between epidemiologically relevant quantities (reproduction number and attack rate) and socio-demographic characteristics of the populations, such as the average age of the population and the duration of primary school cycle. This study provides a numerical approach for the generation of human mixing patterns that can be used to improve the accuracy of mathematical models in the absence of specific experimental data.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The dynamics of infectious diseases caused by pathogens transmissible from human to human strongly depends on contact patterns between individuals. High quality observational data on contact patterns, usually presented in the form of age-specific contact matrices, are difficult to gather and are currently available only for few countries worldwide. Here we propose a computational approach, based on the simulation of a virtual society of agents, allowing the estimation of contact patterns by age for 26 European countries. We validate the estimated contact matrices against those obtained by the most extensive field study on contact patterns, with data collected in eight European countries. We show that our contact matrices share some common features, e.g. individuals tend to mix preferentially with individuals their own age, and country-specific differences, which can be partly explained by differences in population structures due to different demographic trajectories followed after WWII. Our analysis highlights well defined correlations between epidemiological parameters and socio-demographic features of the populations. This study provides the first estimates of contact matrices for many European countries where specific experimental data are still not available.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The accurate characterization of the structure of social contacts in mathematical and computational models of infectious disease transmission is a key element in the assessment of the impact of epidemic outbreaks and in the evaluation of effective control measures. For instance, the transmissibility potential of a disease and the final epidemic size strongly depend on mixing patterns between individuals of the population, which in turn depend on socio-demographic parameters (e.g. household size, fraction of workers and students in the population) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Rohani1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Merler2">[5]</xref>. For this reason, several efforts have been recently carried out in order to obtain contact data with the aim of quantifying “who meets whom (where, when, how long and how often)” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Edmunds1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Horby1">[12]</xref>, possibly also over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Hens1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Eames1">[14]</xref>. Empirical data collection on a large scale is however extremely difficult and although several models tackling both new emerging epidemics and endemic diseases have introduced a significant amount of information on contact patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Merler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Merler2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Eubank1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Guzzetta1">[31]</xref>, it is clear that the increasing use of data-driven models in the support of public health decisions is calling for novel approaches to the estimation of mixing patterns in human populations.</p>
      <p>In this study we propose to overcome the above challenges by developing a general computational approach to derive mixing patterns from routinely collected socio-demographic data. In particular we focus on contact matrices by age of 26 European countries for which we are in the position to construct a synthetic society in the computer by integrating available social and census data. The use of contact matrices is the simplest way to improve on the homogeneous mixing assumption while at the same time preserving the analytical transparency of the model. The proposed approach is based on the simulation of a virtual society of agents that allows the estimate of contact matrices by age in different social settings: household, school, workplace and general community. Unlike classical agent based approaches of epidemic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Merler1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Merler2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Eubank1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Germann1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-CiofiDegliAtti1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Longini1">[32]</xref> and network models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Meyers1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Meyers2">[34]</xref>, which are aimed at characterizing the spatio-temporal spread of epidemics tagging each individual in the population with a set of social attributes, we use the same detailed information on social contacts to construct contact matrices by age in the different settings to be used in compartmental models. This approach integrates population details, providing an effective description of the population structure to be used in computational models relying on compartmental schemes both at the continuous and individual based scale. Such a strategy might be very convenient to reduce the computational time demand in the analysis of large scale geographical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Balcan1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Rvachev1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Kenah1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Those matrices are appropriately combined in order to obtain the overall “adequate” total contact matrix for influenza-like-illness. In order to validate the proposed approach we compare the obtained contact matrices by age with the results of the Polymod study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Mossong1">[9]</xref>, the first large-scale survey on social mixing patterns relevant to infectious disease transmission. We show that the synthetically generated matrices share several common features with the Polymod matrices, e.g. strong assortativeness and the presence of similar secondary diagonal contact patterns. We integrate the synthetic contact matrices in a simple model for acute infectious diseases and highlight the role played by social and demographic factors in determining the different epidemic patterns in different countries. Further analysis and validation on the derived contact matrices is provided by investigating seroprevalence data for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in the UK.</p>
      <p>The proposed method is extremely general and can be readily exported to other countries in the world for which the necessary social and demographic data can be gathered. We consider this approach an important step in order to overcome the current difficulties in real data gathering. Furthermore the computational path to the estimate of contact matrices represents a convenient scheme for the introduction of detailed individual based information in a wide range of modeling approaches working at the population level. For this reason we publicly release the entire collection of contact matrices to the scientific community (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002673.s001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002673.s002">S2</xref>; public download is also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epiwork.eu/resources/matrices" xlink:type="simple">http://www.epiwork.eu/resources/matrices</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>Socio-demographic data</title>
        <p>In order to provide a quantitative estimate of contact matrices for 26 European countries we used highly detailed data on the country-specific socio-demographic structures (e.g., household size and composition, age structure, rates of school attendance, etc.) available at the Statistical Office of the European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Statistical1">[40]</xref>. These data were used to generate highly detailed synthetic populations for all countries of the study area. More specifically, census data on frequencies of household size and type, age of household components by size were used to group individuals into households. Data on rates of employment/inactivity and school attendance by age, structure of educational systems, school and workplace size allowed us to either assign individuals to schools and workplaces or tag them as inactive, according to their age.</p>
        <p>The procedure to generate the synthetic populations is quite standard in the context of individual based models and is therefore discussed in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002673.s003">Text S1</xref>. In the following paragraph we present the approach used in the computation of the synthetic contact matrices.</p>

        <title>Computing contact matrices</title>
        <p>The mathematical representation of epidemics relies on the description of the transmission process which is usually modeled through the force of infection, that is the rate at which a susceptible individual acquires the infection because of the interactions with infectious individuals. This quantity is proportional to the number of infectious individuals, the specific transmission probability of the infection during a contact and the overall rate of contacts of each individual with other individuals in the population. Although a vast majority of studies assumes the population as homogeneous –all individuals are equal with same average contact rate– the social and demographic structure of the population is generally reflected in heterogeneous contact patterns among individuals. Age is obviously one of the main determinants of the mixing pattern of individuals. Children tend to spend more time with children and members of their household, active adults mix with individuals in their workplace etc. Mixing patterns by age are generally defined by a contact matrix whose elements <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the average frequency of “adequate” contacts that an individual of age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has with individuals aged <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We define a contact as “having shared the same physical environment” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Iozzi1">[11]</xref> (e.g., the same household, or the same school or workplace). To compute age-specific contacts we postulate that at the finest scale of the single units, e.g. single households or schools, mixing is homogeneous. This hypothesis is necessary given the lack of information on contacts at this fine scale. By aggregating units we then compute “setting-specific” contact matrices, represented by the four matrices accounting for contacts within household members (matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), within schoolmates/teachers (matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), within workplace colleagues (matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and in the general community (matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Finally, the overall age-specific matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is computed as a linear combination of the four matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>To give an example, let us see in more detail the computation of the matrix of contacts within households, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For each individual <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, living in household <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the household contacts with individuals of age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are defined as the set of individuals of age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> living in household <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        </fig>
        <p>In order to transform the frequency of contacts into contact matrices relevant for infectious disease spreading, we need to consider the following quantities:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which is the probability for age bracket <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to have at least one contact in the household.

            <p><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which is the rate of total effective contacts in the household for individuals of age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This number depends on the time scale, the type of disease etc.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>We can therefore define the synthetic contact matrix for households<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002673.e045"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>which provides the relative frequency of contact among age classes. In order to obtain the rate of effective contacts between classes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we need then to consider the product <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the following, in the lack of a better knowledge, we will assume that the effective contact rate is age independent: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Expressions analogous to the previous one can be used to compute the frequency of contacts by age within schools (superscript <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and within workplaces (superscript <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>); the matrix for schools <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by the sum of the matrices for each school level, from pre-primary to higher education. As regards the frequency of contacts in the general community, we assume homogeneous mixing among individuals, thus the columns of the matrix (superscript <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are proportional to the number of individuals by age.</p>
        <p>In order to define the “adequate” contact matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Hethcote1">[41]</xref> we assume that the total rate of effective contacts in the households can be expressed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total rate of effective contacts and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a constant providing the fraction of effective contacts within the household. Similar expressions can be written for all other settings. Since there is evidence that infection transmission is not uniform by setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Cauchemez2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Melegaro1">[43]</xref> and the relevance of every setting (household, school, work, general community) in the transmission depends on the pathogen responsible for the disease, in principle it is possible to estimate empirically the fraction of transmission events <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in each setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this study, in order to give a baseline, we assume values for influenza-like-illness (ILI) transmission following empirical estimates of the proportions of transmission in the different settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Merler2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Cauchemez2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Ferguson2">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Kwok1">[46]</xref>: 0.3 in households, 0.18 in schools, 0.19 in workplaces and 0.33 in the general community. Although these weights are related to influenza, they have already been used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Iozzi1">[11]</xref> to generate a synthetic contact matrix for the Italian population, which has been shown to capture Varicella and Parvovirus B19 data.</p>
        <p>For each setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we obtain the condition<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002673.e060"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the maximum age of the population. This set of equations readily provides the values<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002673.e062"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The resulting adequate contact matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is therefore defined as the linear combination of the contact matrices in each setting:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002673.e064"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>This notion of adequate matrix of total contacts appears to be appropriate, up to a scale factor, when the transmission coefficients of the infection depend only on settings (i.e. they are age-independent), and provided that the proportions of transmission in the different settings are roughly constant during the course of the epidemic.</p>
        <p>Matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> defines the contact pattern among ages up to a constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that has to be considered as an appropriate rescaling factor when comparing matrices defined according to different time scales or data aggregation processes. In the study of epidemic processes, by assuming that the probability of transmission <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per effective contact is constant, the contact rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is usually absorbed in the definition of the transmissibility rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that is used as the scaling factor determining the reproduction number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that characterizes the specific pathogen transmission. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> essentially represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a completely susceptible population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Anderson1">[47]</xref>, and it is therefore the threshold parameter determining the dynamics of the epidemic.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, our matrices are computed by considering one-year age brackets, from 0 to 100 and over years; this is the most refined version of our data on frequencies of contacts. They can however be aggregated in different ways, depending on the purpose for which they are used: for instance, for childhood diseases one may prefer to group contact data for children according to educational levels.</p>
        <p>Although we are dealing with very detailed data on the socio-demographic structures of European countries, there are a number of limitations and assumptions that it is worth stating. First of all, although the relevant statistics could be gathered from other sources, we consider Eurostat as the only source of data on occupation rates. This is the reason why we decided to exclude Belgium, Poland and Malta from our study in view of the incomplete information on employment and schooling rates. Furthermore, the different household structures considered in our virtual society cover about the 95% of the total number of households in Europe. We do not allow however families with an aggregate member or non-private households (such as rest homes, dorms, religious and military institutions). Finally, another limitation lies in the assumption of homogeneous mixing for the contacts occurring in the community at large (i.e., not occurring between household members, schoolmates and work colleagues). In fact, this implies to disregard any kind of preferential mixing, e.g. by age, and the level of activity of individuals, which may vary by age, as documented by Polymod data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Mossong1">[9]</xref>. Clearly, the availability of more precise and complete data on any aspect of the socio-demographic structure of a population (e.g., number and composition of non-private households; size and attendance of nurseries) would allow a refinement of our virtual society.</p>

        <title>SIR model with heterogeneous mixing patterns</title>

For instance, household mixing is always characterized by the three diagonals representing contacts between siblings/spouse or parents and children, but in Northern Europe and France the upper diagonal is shorter, reflecting the fact that people tend to leave home earlier than in the other countries. The contribution of educational systems is always represented on the lower part of the main diagonal: the observed heterogeneity among countries is driven by the organization of school cycles (e.g. the arrangement of primary and lower secondary schools into either single or separate structures is clearly visible). The central part of the matrices is associated to contacts at work, which depend on the age structure of the working population. Moreover, we can observe that mixing with individuals of about 60 years of age tends to be higher in Northern countries and lower in the others, particularly in Southern Europe: this is probably due to differences in retirement age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Statistical2">[52]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In order to infer more rigorously whether similarities between contact matrices can be identified to characterize specific groups of countries, we use a hierarchical cluster algorithm. The algorithm uses the average dissimilarity between two matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (treated as vectors) as measured by the Canberra distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; this choice was made because the entries of contact matrices range over several orders of magnitude, and this distance, differently from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distances, is appropriate to measure average relative dissimilarities rather than absolute dissimilarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Critchlow1">[53]</xref>. We found that contact matrices can be clustered in a way mainly reflecting the geographical location of the country. This may be motivated with the observation that neighboring states, for historical and cultural reasons, show marked similarities in school organization and demographic structures. The latter are well explained by the common demographic trajectories followed after World War II with respect to major structural changes, from the baby boom in the Sixties, to the fall towards low fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Kohler1">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In particular, we isolated four main clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g003">Figure 3</xref>): Ireland and Cyprus, Eastern, Southern and Northern Europe. This grouping can be partly explained in terms of some macroscopic indicators such as average age (which is a proxy for the number of students in the population), household size (see inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and school organization. For instance, Ireland and Cyprus are the youngest European countries: the average ages are 34.1 and 35.7 years respectively, while the overall average age in Europe is 39.2. Moreover, they have the largest household size (2.88 individuals for Ireland, 2.98 for Cyprus, 2.49 for Europe). All Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark) are grouped into a unique sub-cluster which is characterized by large average age and small household size. Eastern and Southern Europe are similar in terms of average age and household size, but in Southern countries elementary and lower secondary schools are organized as separate structures, whereas a unique cycle is predominant in Eastern countries. Interestingly, in Eastern Europe two sub-clusters can be identified: Czech Republic-Slovakia, which became two independent states few years ago, and Estonia-Latvia. Lithuania instead is grouped with Germany and Austria: this distinction may be due, at least partially, to Lithuanian school organization, which is similar to Central and Western Europe.</p>

        <title>Validation with Polymod contact matrices</title>
        <p>In order to validate the data driven modeling approach at the origin of the synthetic contact matrices we compared our matrices with those obtained by the Polymod project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Mossong1">[9]</xref>. Polymod currently represents the most accurate and extensive study on mixing patterns in Europe. We considered only the subset of countries common to both our approach and the survey study, namely Germany, Finland, United Kingdom, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. By jointly regressing the matrices for all countries, each of them normalized so that the sum of all its elements is one, the value of the coefficient of determination <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the linear regression model is 0.72. However, we found that the estimated value of the intercept is very close to 0 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.01). Thus we fit a linear model with zero intercept and a single slope coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g004">Figure 4a</xref>), concluding that most statistical variation between Polymod matrices and ours can be captured by a single scale factor. Taking every country singularly and applying the linear model with zero intercept to the original matrices (without normalization), we got a coefficient of determination ranging from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in Germany to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). The estimated scale factor depends on the considered country, because of the large variability in the average number of contacts of an individual in the Polymod matrices.

        <title>Contact matrices and seroprevalence profiles</title>
        <p>Another way to assess and validate our approach consists in the analysis of the prevalence by age profile generated by using Polymod matrices and our synthetic matrices in ILI epidemic models. As an example, we considered the epidemic prevalence generated by an age structured SIR model in a fully susceptible population (as detailed in the Materials and Methods section). The model includes the heterogeneity of contacts by age by introducing a force of infection across age groups modulated by the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We considered a basic reproduction number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and compared the results obtained by using the contact matrices derived from both the Polymod survey and our model. The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g004">Figure 4d</xref> show that Polymod matrices and synthetic matrices yield qualitatively comparable profiles of seroprevalence by age for all countries, with a few noticeable deviations in Germany and the Netherlands (i.e. the countries having the lowest values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the linear model, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). As a double check with regards to the Netherlands, we performed the simulations also by considering the contact matrix reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Wallinga1">[7]</xref> and obtained by a survey prior to the Polymod one. In this case the results are in good agreement for age groups under 60 years old, while for elderly individuals our matrix gives results closer to those obtained by using the Polymod matrix.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, in order to validate numerical simulations against empirical data, we compared predictions of our and Polymod contact matrices to seroprevalence data collected in England and Wales at the end of the second wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Hardelid1">[49]</xref>. We simulated this epidemic by using both the Polymod and our contact matrix for the United Kingdom. An age-specific susceptibility to infection was assumed; however, this parameter has not been fitted to epidemic data, but its value has been set to 2.0 for children under 16 years of age, following the estimate in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Fraser1">[50]</xref> later confirmed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Merler2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Cauchemez4">[51]</xref>. The only degree of freedom in the fit is therefore represented by the scale factor which can be tuned to obtain different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g004">Figure 4c</xref>: our model is able to reproduce well the seroprevalence of individuals in the classes 0–4, 5–14 and 65+ years old, while it underestimates intermediate age groups, where the Polymod matrix instead performs slightly better. Overall, model simulations belong to the 95% confidence interval of serological data in five of the six age groups considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Hardelid1">[49]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It is worth remarking that profiles predicted by employing our matrices are smooth because the proportions of contacts are derived from the entire simulated population. Polymod matrices instead are based on the observation of a sample of the population, and this leads to a less regular seroprevalence profile (as can be seen for instance for the Netherlands, where prevalence for individuals aged 19–29 appears to be much lower than for the adjoining age groups). More in general, the prevalence predicted from the synthetic mixing patterns is higher among school-age children, intermediate for working ages and progressively declining in the elderly; prevalence among little children is at an intermediate level. This pattern is mainly driven by country-specific employment and schooling rates, along with the scholastic organization. Simulated seroprevalences, using our contact matrices in the same epidemic setting, for the countries not covered by Polymod are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002673.s003">Text S1</xref>. The shapes are all similar; however, some differences are visible: for instance, following the decline of prevalence after school age, a second steep decay occurs in all countries at a variable age, generally higher (around 60) in Northern Europe and lower (around 50) elsewhere and more markedly in Southern countries. This is probably an effect of the differences in the retirement age across Europe, as we previously pointed out.</p>

        <title>Comparison with average European matrix</title>
        <p>An intermediate choice between homogeneous mixing and country-specific contact patterns would be to consider mixing patterns as derived by appropriately averaging over the 26 country-specific contact matrices; therefore in this section we compare results obtained by assuming homogeneous mixing, the average European matrix and country-specific matrices. We considered an SIR model where all the basic parameters and scaling factors are set on the baseline yielding a basic reproduction number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the European average. For each country we used the synthetic contact matrices aggregated by one-year age brackets up to 84 years of age (so that all matrices have the same dimension). All other parameters being equal, the different contact matrices in each country define different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and different epidemic behaviors in each country. In particular, the reproduction number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be calculated (see Materials and Methods section) for each contact matrix.</p>
        <p>The improvement obtained by using either the European average matrix or country-specific matrices compared to the homogeneous model is evident e.g. in terms of final attack rate which, as already noticed in previous computational studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Ajelli2">[26]</xref>, is always overestimated by the homogeneous assumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002673-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). Although we found a strong positive correlation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and attack rate following the country-specific approach (Pearson correlation test <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>p</italic>-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002673.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the result is clearly far from the homogeneous mixing model that does not consider any contact structure.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In this work we propose a method, based on the analysis of the contact network in a highly detailed virtual society, and compute the related matrices of adequate contacts for 26 European countries.</p>
        <p>Our analysis highlights well defined correlations between epidemiological parameters and socio-demographic features of the populations. Specifically, we found that the basic reproduction number is well explained by a linear model having average age of the population and duration of primary school cycle as independent variables, whose values are easily derivable from routinely collected social and demographic data. In addition, the average age appears as the main determinant in explaining differences in final attack rates between countries. In this perspective, the use of synthetic contact matrices helps in improving the accuracy of mathematical models predictions, which are increasingly used for supporting public health decisions.</p>
        <p>It is worth remarking that the presented approach is based on routinely collected data, and it can be easily extended to every country for which socio-demographic data are available. Notably, by providing information by one-year age brackets, our contact matrices are particularly suitable when dealing with childhood diseases which require detailed information on contact patterns in the youngest age classes. Finally, our method may be used also retrospectively, in order to reconstruct contact patterns in the past by using data from previous census rounds; this would be useful to review classic results based on indirect estimates of contacts, such as WAIFW matrices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002673-Anderson1">[47]</xref>.</p>
