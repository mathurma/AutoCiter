<abstract>
<p>Biomedical research has been previously reported to primarily focus on a minority of all known genes. Here, we demonstrate that these differences in attention can be explained, to a large extent, exclusively from a small set of identifiable chemical, physical, and biological properties of genes. Together with knowledge about homologous genes from model organisms, these features allow us to accurately predict the number of publications on individual human genes, the year of their first report, the levels of funding awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the development of drugs against disease-associated genes. By explicitly identifying the reasons for gene-specific bias and performing a meta-analysis of existing computational and experimental knowledge bases, we describe gene-specific strategies for the identification of important but hitherto ignored genes that can open novel directions for future investigation.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Biomedical research is one of the largest areas of present-day science and embeds the hope and potential to improve the lives of the general public. In order to understand how individual scientists choose individual research questions, we study why certain genes are well studied but others are not. While it has been previously observed that most research on human genes only concentrates on approximately 2,000 of the 19,000 genes of the human genome, the reasons for this ignorance are largely unknown. We systematically test explanations for this observation by compiling an extensive resource that characterizes biomedical research, including but not limited to hundreds of chemical and biological properties of gene-encoded proteins, and the published scientific literature on individual genes. Using machine learning methods, we can predict the number of publications on individual genes, the year of the first publication about them, the extent of funding by the National Institutes of Health, and the existence of related medical drugs. We find that biomedical research is primarily guided by a handful of generic chemical and biological characteristics of genes, which facilitated experimentation during the 1980s and 1990s, rather than the physiological importance of individual genes or their relevance to human disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated the highly imbalanced research effort directed towards individual human protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref008">8</xref>], which manifests itself in several ways, including the number of publications per gene, the number of human-curated and computationally predicted functional annotations, the number of gene names and gene symbols, and the number of patents containing their nucleotide sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Plausibly, this observed disparity could reflect a lack of importance of many genes, but more likely it could also reflect existing social structures of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref010">10</xref>], scientific and economic reward systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref012">12</xref>], medical and societal relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref015">15</xref>], preceding discoveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref016">16</xref>], serendipity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref018">18</xref>], the availability of technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref020">20</xref>] and reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref021">21</xref>], and other intrinsic characteristics of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref024">24</xref>]. It remains unclear, however, if any of these factors can significantly explain the observed number of publications on individual human genes. Nor is it known whether descriptions about the formation of scientific knowledge translate into gene-specific insight, and whether these reasons for historically grown bias could already be mitigated by current experimental possibilities.</p>
<p>In order to address these challenges, we created a database cross-referencing chemical, physical, biological, historical, bibliometric, financial, technological, and experimental data on all human protein-coding genes from 36 different sources (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>). Using this resource, we show how characteristics of genes relate to the macroscopic output of biomedical research in terms of the number of publications, perceived biological importance of genes, funding, and translational activities. We show different examples of how this resource can be used to define strategies for a more efficient exploration of the space of biological functions, and provide high-level gene-specific analyses in a series of supplementary tables.</p>

<p>To test if measurable intrinsic chemical, physical, and biological features of genes and gene products alone suffice to describe the number of publications per gene, we gathered 430 features per gene, which could either be computed from known sequences of these genes or obtained from previously published genome-scale experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed that 33% of the protein-coding genes carrying an official gene name had an incomplete catalog of features. The dominant reasons for the absence of features were the absence of reported insertions within recent Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) loss-of-function screens (about 13% of genes, depending on assay), the absence of detectable RNA across all tissues and cell lines surveyed by the human protein atlas (6% of genes), the absence of validated RNA molecules within the Genbank reference database of RNA molecules (5% of genes), and the absence of reported protein molecules within the UniProt reference database for protein molecules (3% of genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s016">S1 Table</xref>). Foreshadowing our subsequent analyses, the absence of reported features correlated with a lower number of reported publications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). This initial result illustrates limitations in experimental approaches and a surprising degree of uncertainty that remains about human genes and the existence of their gene products.</p>

<p>To assess whether the values of these features, rather than solely their presence, would quantitatively inform on the number of publications of individual genes, we proceeded by only considering the 12,948 genes with a complete set of features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s017">S2 Table</xref>). Using gradient boosting regressions with out-of-sample Monte Carlo cross-validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref025">25</xref>], we could predict to a significant extent the number of publications on any given gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, Spearman: 0.64). Remarkably, 15 out of 430 features contributed the most to our model’s accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) and fell into six categories that specify the abundance of gene-encoded RNA and protein molecules across multiple tissues (RNA abundance in adrenal glands, appendix, brain, and liver; fraction of tissues with detectable RNA expression; and protein abundance in HeLa cells), the positive charge of proteins, the hydrophobicity of proteins, the sensitivity of genes towards mutations (incidence rate of missense mutations in human populations, incidence rate of loss-of-function mutations in human populations, tolerance against homozygous or recessive loss-of-function variation in human populations, CRISPR score in KBM7 cells), the length of the corresponding transcript and gene, and the presence of signal sequences that promote the translocation of nascent proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. These 15 features are sufficient to account for the model’s accuracy because models using exclusively those features yields prediction accuracies highly comparable to those of the full model when trained on the same 12,948 genes with a complete catalog of features (Spearman: 0.61, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), or on all 15,056 genes on which these 15 features are defined (Spearman: 0.59, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s003">S3C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We therefore used these 15 features to define a 15-dimensional space for the 15,056 genes that reflects the correlation between publications and individual features and combinations of distinct features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s018">S3 Table</xref>). Clusters of genes within this space were enriched for distinct Gene Ontology annotations and thus known biological roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This initial finding demonstrates that the number of publications on genes can be attributed in a large extent solely to a small set of their physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.</p>

<title>Past research priorities strongly impact current initiatives</title>
<p>The 15 features described above have all been suspected to affect the ability to study specific genes by traditional methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref028">28</xref>].

In line with the similarity among prior reports on the disparity in the number of publications per gene, we found that the present inequality in the number of publications has stayed constant since the year 2000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). Similarly, we found the number of publications per gene to be highly correlated between the current decade and preceding time periods of research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, Spearman: 0.84). Interestingly, we also identify six genes that are presently experiencing a strong increase in their number of publications, which can be traced back to a recent acknowledgment of their medical importance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s019">S4 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast to the alternative hypothesis that research patterns on human genes would be particularly dynamic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref002">2</xref>], and generalizing beyond earlier studies on two gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref021">21</xref>] and genes expressed specifically in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref030">30</xref>], we find that human genes that had been reported early—as indicated by an early initial publication date on the genes or their encoded gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref031">31</xref>]—tend to also be more studied presently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s005">S5C Fig</xref>, Spearman: 0.58). For example, all genes that had been reported upon by 1991 (corresponding to 16% of all genes) account for 49% of the literature of the year 2015 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). Initial reports further add to the predictability of the number of publications as an inclusion of their year improves the models’ accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, Spearman: 0.75). To identify the factors associated with the initial reports of genes, we next created separate models with the above 430 features and trained them to predict the year of initial publications. While these predictions are slightly less accurate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, Spearman: 0.48) than predictions on the number of publications, the underlying models again selected for highly similar features—most prominently, the presence of signal peptides, the abundance of transcript and protein molecules, and the sensitivity towards mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s005">S5E Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s020">S5 Table</xref>). This shows that characteristics of genes, which have been important for the initial discovery of genes, remain partially correlated with the number of present publications on those genes.</p>
<p>Similarly, we observe that while the number of publications is correlated between the first entry (e.g., AKT1) and the second entry (e.g., AKT2) of a gene family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s005">S5F Fig</xref>, Spearman: 0.69), first entries have more publications (Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test: <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 10<sup>−24</sup>). This demonstrates that even among evolutionary and chemically highly related genes, early initial reports coincide with a higher number of publications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s005">S5F Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Knowledge from model organisms drives research on human genes</title>
<p>Yet, the reduced prediction accuracy observed for the prediction of the year of the initial report may hint at the presence of another factor or factors that were not included in our curation of 430 gene-intrinsic features. Thus, we performed a bibliometric analysis of PubMed to compare individual publications against the genes contained in the publications that they cite. Focusing on the publications reporting the discovery of new human genes, we found an overrepresentation of publications that cite studies of nonhuman genes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s006">S6A</xref>). Inspecting the organisms of these genes, we observed two classes of organisms. The first class preferentially co-occurred together with human genes and consisted of <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, <italic>Bos taurus</italic>, and <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (37%, 9.1%, 2.6%, 2.5% of all citations, respectively). The second class preferentially occurred in publications without human genes and consisted of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (22%, 10%, 4.0%, 2.5%, 1.6%, 1.5% of all citations, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Assuming that citations are one proxy of scientific impact, this finding suggests that initial reports on human genes have been particularly influenced by research in model organisms and that multiple model organisms have contributed complementary roles in the discovery of human genes.</p>
<p>With these insights, we dramatically increased the prediction accuracy of the year of initial report of a human gene by including the years of the initial reports on homologous genes of model organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, from Spearman: 0.48 to 0.71). Moreover, the years of the initial reports on homologous genes improved prediction accuracy of the number of publications to a greater extent than the year of the initial report on the human genes themselves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s007">S7A Fig</xref>, Spearman: 0.81).</p>
<p>Consistent with the picture emerging from these analyses, the homologous genes of unstudied human genes are likewise unstudied in model organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s021">S6 Table</xref>), and including the number of publications on homologous genes yielded almost perfect predictions of the number of publications for individual human genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, Spearman: 0.87), while human-specific genes without homologous genes remain significantly less studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s007">S7B Fig</xref>, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test: <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 10<sup>−32</sup>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the impact of research on model organisms on the knowledge acquired on human biology—a hypothesis that had been proposed but not demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<title>Characteristics of genes affect research on important biology</title>
<p>Given the observed historic continuity of scientific endeavors, we wondered whether biomedical research has already identified all particularly important human genes and hence allocates the production of publications accordingly. We follow the naïve assumption that researchers distribute their attention equally across all genes contained in the same publication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Despite this simplifying assumption, we reassuringly observe that genes that have received the most attention in publications are around three to five times more likely to be sensitive to loss-of-function mutations or to have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This enrichment is greatest for genes that have been repeatedly identified by several independent studies on the most frequently studied human phenotypic traits. However, we observe an extraordinarily more extreme 13-fold enrichment in the average attention when comparing the genes that have received the least attention to those genes that have received the highest attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Hence, while biomedical research does focus on important genes, a disproportionally high amount of research effort concentrates on already well-studied genes.</p>

<p>We observe a similar pattern when inspecting the allocation of funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as another proxy of importance. Although not surprising given the correlation between the number of publications per gene and the amount of funding allocation by the NIH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>, Spearman: 0.95), the above modeling strategy accurately predicts the allocation of billions of research dollars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, Spearman 0.70), and would do so particularly well for genes supported by multiple grants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). Yet, prediction accuracy only marginally improves by additionally considering 3,176 features detailing known annotations between genes and diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9D Fig</xref>, Spearman: 0.73), and is greatly—but not completely—impaired if only considering the latter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9E Fig</xref>, Spearman 0.43). This shows that the previously uncovered intrinsic characteristics of genes and the year of the initial report of homologous genes not only correlate with research funding, but that they would do so to a larger extent than presently existent knowledge about the role of genes in disease.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, if exclusively considering genes with a reported role in disease, we found that the same models that had predicted the year of the initial publication of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) also predicted the likelihood of the existence of both approved and preclinical drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings show that a small number of characteristics of genes and the availability of model organisms exert a strong influence on basic and applied research on human disease and that the resulting research can significantly deviate from the actual biological importance of individual genes.</p>

<title>Feasibility of alternative discovery strategies</title>
<p>The strong correlations uncovered, and earlier work on the availability of reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref021">21</xref>] suggest, that researchers may face very practical constraints that prevent them from exploring little-studied genes and that there might be a need for alternative discovery strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref033">33</xref>]. In support of this possibility and extending beyond the above findings on the bulk of accrued knowledge, we observe that the fraction of genes that have been described in focused single-gene studies has only been increasing at a constant rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Extrapolating from this trend, we estimate that it would take at least five decades until all genes are sufficiently studied. Similarly, simply studying little-studied genes might not be very informative and could expose junior scientists at an increased career risk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). Along the same lines, grant categories of the NIH dedicated to exploratory research, which do not require preliminary data, and grants categories dedicated to innovative research or the training of scientists all closely reproduce the imbalance observed for the biomedical literature, with 5% of the human protein-coding genes accounting for half of the publications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s010">S10B and S10C Fig</xref>). Given a recent bibliometric study, which demonstrated that novelty could, however, be beneficial for the impact of a scientific publication if combined with an established research context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref034">34</xref>], we therefore thought to build a resource that provides a context for the exploration of little-studied genes.</p>

<p>Inspecting the properties of existing publications on little-studied genes, we found that these genes tend to occur in large-scale investigations that include most genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s011">S11A and S11B Fig</xref>). Hinting at an ability of large-scale studies to support research on less investigated genes, we observed that these studies serve as a frequent reference for other publications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s011">S11C Fig</xref>) and that single-gene studies that refer to them tend to focus on genes that are less studied than those genes contained in single-gene studies that refer to single-gene studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s011">S11D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the extent to which large-scale collections of biological information could already serve as potential starting points for detailed characterizations on most genes, we next extended our resource with databases—such as a collection of public RNA interference (RNAi) experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref035">35</xref>], a catalog of human protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref036">36</xref>], and a catalog of public differential gene expression experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref037">37</xref>]—that could potentially be affected by biased experimental choices. We find that the 27% of genes that have never been studied by a full publication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s012">S12A Fig</xref>) are less frequently identified in publicly available data of large-scale experiments and that they are less likely to have characteristics associated with a high number of publications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s012">S12B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>However, we also find that there already exist gene-specific data on possible experimentation for 83% of them and that for 25% of them, there exist at least three qualitatively distinct types of data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s012">S12C Fig</xref>). This strongly suggests that the characteristics of genes and homologous genes that prevented their early discovery would no longer prevent their more detailed study.</p>
<p>To facilitate exploration and hypothesis generation, we provide a curated guide that specifically directs to the appropriate sources of gene-specific preliminary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s022">S7 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis further shows that distinct large-scale approaches cover distinct areas of the 15-dimensional space, with genes identified in high-throughput interaction studies being strongly enriched in regions containing abundantly expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref023">23</xref>], and genes identified through differential expression studies being enriched in regions containing genes whose transcripts are ubiquitously detected in adult tissues through current technology. In contrast, genes identified through their phenotypes within loss-of-function RNAi screens cover the 15-dimensional space more evenly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Similarly, genes with a highly reproduced association to genetic traits cover multiple areas of the 15-dimensional space, some predicting a large number of publications and others predicting a small number of publications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). For illustration, consider the RNA of the heavily studied gene, TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is undetectable in most adult tissues. While our analysis shows that this biological characteristic is generally associated with a low number of publications, the absence of TERT restricts excess cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref038">38</xref>]—a factor that overcomes the difficulty in its study following its ectopic activation. Another interesting illustration is provided by the poorly studied breast cancer gene CCDC170, which encodes for one of the most charged and acidic human proteins but also appears to have some structural role in maintaining the organization of Golgi-associated microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref039">39</xref>]. As a final illustration, consider C1orf106, a gene with the second-strongest genetic association to ulcerative colitis. Despite being among the top 20% of genes with the most frequently identified associations in differential gene expression experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s022">S7 Table</xref>), C1orf106 had never been followed up until recently, when gene-specific pull-down experiments revealed its role in the regulation of the stability of epithelial adherens junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref040">40</xref>]. This demonstrates that functional studies remain a powerful strategy to discover novel biology that does not reproduce past research biases.</p>
<p>To provide a broader perspective on the strategic options for further exploration, we next introduced aggregate measures for the presence of genetic support and experimental approachability and the existence of homologous genes in invertebrate model organisms. While some of the initially identified clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) seem experimentally well accessible in humans or model organisms, other clusters seem resilient to those approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006643.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). An opposite example is a cluster enriching for transcriptional coactivator activity. It contains several evolutionarily conserved genes that are highly sensitive towards loss-of-function mutations and experimentally approachable. This cluster contains multiple highly studied modulators of cellular physiology, such as the genes MTOR, CLTC, TAF1, and CREBBP. However, this cluster also contains DICER1, which catalyzes the maturation of microRNAs and is a recent recipient of research attention, and whose discovery was perceived as an enormous surprise following a long-held lack of attention towards non–protein-mediated gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref041">41</xref>]. Intriguingly, this cluster includes two still mostly uncharacterized members of large gene families, IPO9 and ANKRD52. This lack of attention illustrates that even genes with seemingly promising characteristics can remain mostly ignored. To facilitate identification of such genes, we are also providing a list of these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s023">S8 Table</xref>) and a map that identifies them within the vicinity of custom sets of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s024">S9 Table</xref>). We further add another map that allows probing custom sets of genes for the above aggregate measures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s025">S10 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because the difficulty of pursuing different research directions varies both within distinct fields of biological and nonbiological inquiry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref016">16</xref>], we suspect that our findings may be generalizable to other areas of science. For example, mathematics dealt for centuries nearly exclusively with “smooth” curves; only in the last half century did it address the study of infinitely rough curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Our work demonstrates that even highly promising genes that could already be studied by current technologies remain ignored. This suggests that the ossification of past research topics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref043">43</xref>], which for human genes becomes apparent at the turn of the millennium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>), reflects upon processes that extend beyond past experimental possibilities. Indeed, a recent seminal bibliometric study on 250 scientific fields, including molecular biology, demonstrated that scientific fields move from a phase characterized by “the rich get richer” towards a phase of ossification as the annual number of publications increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref043">43</xref>]. Our study provides empirical support for the presence of several processes that could possibly contribute to this ossification, including but not limited to the availability of prior knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref007">7</xref>]; biases in computational annotations; the availability of reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref021">21</xref>]; the career prospects of junior researchers; the support by grants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref003">3</xref>]; training agendas; the presence of an overwhelming set of competing future research options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref043">43</xref>]; a slow transition of research between large-scale studies and small-scale studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref045">45</xref>]; a sustained ease to experimentally study certain genes; a shortage of large-scale studies that attribute function through perturbing genes and monitoring altered physiology rather than through guilt by association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref047">47</xref>]; and a decrease in the workforce that uses model organisms, which accelerated around the year 2000 in favor of an increased fraction of scientists that exclusively work on human genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). Similarly, our work shows that, with some rare exceptions, the human genome project did not suffice to promote an exploration of novel genes and the biology encoded by them.</p>
<p>Given their presence in the human genome, it is certain that the majority of protein-coding genes have biological relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref048">48</xref>]. For some genes the relevance might be apparent, such as for the δ- and β-globins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref050">50</xref>], which mark among the first human genomic clones and encode for the hemoglobin subunits. For other genes, most of their physiological relevance might only unfold after their basic characterization outside of medical contexts, such as for the heat shock-inducible gene HSP70, which marks an important subsequent human genomic cloning endeavor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref051">51</xref>] and participates in a network of genes that control protein homeostasis—a process whose failure characterizes aging in humans and model organisms, and a basis for diseases of protein conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref052">52</xref>]. Furthermore, many current insights on biology relate to monogenic experimentation schemes, whereas biological processes appear polygenic, which could plausibly further contribute to the continued inability to explain many of the biological processes known to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref053">53</xref>]. Indeed, our work supports the hypotheses that an insufficient understanding of the biology of many disease genes has prevented the successful development of therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref055">55</xref>] and that preclinical research is biased towards experimentally well-accessible genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref028">28</xref>]. To visualize potentially implicit biases underlying distinct research projects and findings, we provide a copy of the 15-dimensional feature space, whose regions correspond to distinct biases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s018">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to accelerate the pace of discovery, we propose the need for funding mechanisms of scientists and calls for proposals that encourage the pursuit of nonredundant and likely highly unpredictable research directions. In order to counter the career forces currently pushing towards conformity, there would be a need for stable, long-term support for such innovators to focus on the unknown. Just as the Royal Society sponsored target studies of the unknown with an eye towards the economic potential of certain discoveries, we also predict that exploring the uncharted territories of unknown biology by investigating unstudied and understudied genes will yield satisfying observations that would contribute economically and medically. We believe that the resource presented here provides a jumping point for further systems-level investigation on the formation of scientific knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref056">56</xref>] and a guide to researchers who want to identify promising but little-studied genes.</p>

<title>Data engineering</title>
<p>For genes, we determined the fraction corresponding to every nucleobase, and the combined ratio of cytosine and guanine, and counted the number of all nucleobases. For protein-coding sequences, we additionally determined the fraction corresponding to individual codons and measured the codon bias according to multiple methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref070">70</xref>].</p>
<p>For transcripts, we obtained FPKM values from Uhlen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref064">64</xref>] and additionally determined the fraction of samples with an expression below 1 FPKM analogously as a surrogate for detectable expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
<p>For SwissProt and TrEMBL proteins, we determined the fraction of the primary sequence covered by individual amino acids. Moreover, we used BioPython [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref071">71</xref>] to determine the fraction of acidic, aromatic, basic, charged, helix affine, hydrophobic, polar, uncharged polar, sheet affine, and turn affine amino acids. We further used BioPython to estimate protein GRAVY, the protein’s isoelectric point, and molecular weight. Additionally, we counted the total amount of amino acids and thus the length of the protein. We used the Python version of RADAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref072">72</xref>] with its default settings to measure the total number of repeats, and the total RADAR score, and the length of the highest scoring repeat.

We used SignalP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref074">74</xref>] with its default settings to determine the presence of a predicted cleavage site, the maximal cleavage score, the presence of at least four transmembrane residues, and the nucleotide position of the mature protein.</p>

<p>We predicted the log10-transformed number of publications and z-scored the features across genes. We used 90% of the genes as training data and predicted the remaining 10%. We performed at least 400 randomizations using randomly chosen subsets without replacement. This corresponds to a number of iterations in which, within initial test runs, we would not observe changes in the pooled readout within the number of digits provided in this publication. We used Scikit-learn’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref025">25</xref>] (version 0.19) Gradient Boosting Regressor with 300 estimators and a Huber loss function.

We equally distributed the total money allocated to a given NIH project ID to all publications supported by this project, and subsequently within the individual genes in this project. We used disease associations from Malacards for Unified Diseases, Orphanet, Human phenotypes, and OMIM as disease linkage features and constructed additional features that would count for the total number of entries within each of the four data sets. Because of computational constraints, we subsequently removed disease linkage features with fewer than 10 genes. Notably, prediction accuracy did not improve if keeping all linkages of Unified Diseases (Spearman 0.73 for addition on top of other features—analogously to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9D Fig</xref>; Spearman 0.42 for exclusive usage—analogously to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9E Fig</xref>) or OMIM (Spearman 0.71 for addition on top of other features—analogously to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9D Fig</xref>; Spearman 0.16 for exclusive usage—analogously to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006643.s009">S9E Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of transitioning to a future principal investigator status</title>
<p>As the rank of the popularity, we used the fractional count of publications up until the indicated year. We only considered publications of authors that have not yet transitioned to a principal investigator status. As principal investigator status, we consider authors that have at least two last author publications with at least one fellow coauthor.</p>

<sec id="sec032">
<title>Mapping of Web of Science to MEDLINE</title>
<p>We matched publications contained in MEDLINE to records from Web of Science in a two-step process:</p>
<p>(a) if available, we used the digital object identifier (DOI), allowing for an unambiguous identification of publication entries;</p>
<p>(b) otherwise, given the MEDLINE record, we retrieve all publications from Web of Science with the same list of authors’ last names, and that were published in the same year and journal. We then identify the best-matching record by calculating the Levenshtein distance (implemented in seatgeek’s FuzzyWuzzy Python package: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy" xlink:type="simple">https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy</ext-link>) between titles of the MEDLINE and the Web of Science record, respectively. We only considered publications that would map unambiguously and had a mapping score of at least 95 (maximum score 100).</p>
<p>In total, for 97% of all publications in MEDLINE containing a reference to a gene, we were able to identify the corresponding record in Web of Science.</p>

<title>Analysis of fraction of highly cited publications</title>
<p>Following Uzzi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006643.ref034">34</xref>], we counted citations over the 8 years following the year of the publication. Publications with more than two authors and publications with consortium as the sole affiliation were considered to be team publications. For the analysis of BioGRID, we considered BioGRID entries that had been associated with at least one gene in MEDLINE and counted the unique genes of a publication—after pooling the indicated gene A and gene B entries of an interaction—which would usually be indicative of bait and hit, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec034">
<title>Analysis of experimentation</title>
<p>Western blots following affinity purification were obtained from BioGRID. For differential gene expression analysis, we used EBI GXA and considered genes to be differentially expressed if their (nonadjusted) <italic>p</italic>-value would be below 0.0001. For RNAi, we only considered phenotypes that were not measured through distinct shRNA abundance and only considered genes occurring in at least 20 studies (which could possibly have monitored distinct phenotypes). We considered a gene to have a strong RNAi if more than 30% of the studies containing the gene would report a phenotype for this gene. This was motivated by the (not shown) observation that genes fall into a bimodal distribution according to the fraction of studies reporting a phenotype, separated at the chosen threshold of 30%.</p>
