<article-title>Short Stimulus, Long Response: Sodium and Calcium Dynamics Explain Persistent Neuronal Firing</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Persistent activity has been reported in many brain areas and is hypothesized to mediate working memory and emotional brain states and to rely upon network or biophysical feedback. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which persistent neuronal activity can be generated without feedback, relying instead on the slow removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from neurons following bursts of activity. We show that mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), which plays a major role in mammalian social behavior, may respond to a brief sensory stimulation with persistent firing. By combining electrical recordings, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> imaging, and realistic computational modeling, we explored the mechanisms underlying the persistent activity in AOB mitral cells. We found that the exceptionally slow inward current that underlies this activity is governed by prolonged dynamics of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), which affects neuronal electrical activity via several pathways. Specifically, elevated dendritic [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> reverses the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger activity, thus modifying the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> set-point. This process, which relies on ubiquitous membrane mechanisms, is likely to play a role in other neuronal types in various brain regions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The accessory olfactory system is essential for chemical communication in animals during social interactions. During this process, the principle cells of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) may respond to transient stimulation with prolonged activity, sometimes lasting for minutes—a property known as persistent activity. This property, which has been observed in other brain areas, is usually attributed to positive feedback mechanisms either at the cellular or the network level. Here, we show how persistent activity can emerge without feedback, relying on slow changes in internal ionic concentrations, which keep a record of past neuronal activity for long periods of time. We used a combined computational and experimental approach to show that the complex interaction between various ions, their extrusion mechanisms, and the membrane potential leads to stimulus-dependent persistent activity in the AOB. The same mechanism may apply to other neuronal types in various brain regions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The accessory olfactory system, also known as the vomeronasal system, mediates chemical communication between conspecifics of most mammalian and reptilian species during social interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref001">1</xref>]. Inputs to this chemosensory system originate from the sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) that synapse on the mitral cells of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), which provide the output of the bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref002">2</xref>]. Previously, we have shown that AOB mitral cells in vitro respond to brief afferent nerve stimulation with persistent firing activity lasting several minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Persistent activity, defined as the ability of neurons to remain active in the absence of external inputs, was documented in many brain areas. Such activity enables the brain to maintain an internal state without continuous external input. It has been suggested that persistent activity is a neuronal correlate of working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref004">4</xref>], and that it can mediate neuronal integration over long time scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The time scale of persistent activity (&gt;1 min) is much longer than that of most biophysical mechanisms (typically 0.5–100 ms). Most attempts to explain how the extremely prolonged time scales of persistent activity emerge from such rapid biophysical processes have involved feedback mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref006">6</xref>]. Such feedback can be implemented with recurrent excitation at the network level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref009">9</xref>], or alternatively, by biochemical pathways at the cellular level. An example of the latter is the mechanism proposed to underlie persistent activity in the entorhinal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref011">11</xref>] and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref013">13</xref>]. The mechanism involves an interaction between Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during spiking and a calcium-activated non-selective (CAN) cation conductance that depolarizes the cell. However, theoretical models of prolonged spiking based on feedback mechanisms are hard to construct in a way that is robust to small parameter changes, immune to noise and continuously graded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Persistent activity in AOB mitral cells was shown to depend upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and CAN conductance. However, this intrinsic cellular mechanism does not depend on a feedback cycle involving ongoing neural activity, as persistent firing readily resumes after a temporal firing cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study we combined electrophysiological, imaging, and computational approaches to explore the mechanisms underlying persistent firing in AOB mitral cells. We describe a novel mechanism involving interplay between homeostatic processes controlling intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. This novel mechanism, which does not rely upon feedback, is both resistant to noise and allows multiple stable firing states.</p>

<title>AOB Mitral Cells Are Capable of Responding to Transient Stimuli with Persistent Firing, Both In Vitro And In Vivo</title>
<p>Prolonged firing activity of AOB mitral cells was demonstrated in behaving mice during social investigation of conspecifics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref017">17</xref>]. It has remained unclear whether this sustained activity reflects the continuous detection of the stimulus or network properties. In order to explore this issue, we examined AOB responses in anesthetized mice following well-controlled chemosensory stimulus application to the VNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s002">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<p>While response dynamics often matched those attributed to the vomeronasal pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref019">19</xref>], in other cases, elevated firing rates remained high well beyond this time scale, sometimes even after the stimulus was flushed from the nasal cavity and the VNO. Under a highly strict statistical criterion (see Data Analysis in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and Methods</xref>), reliable cases of persistent activity were found in about one percent (<italic>n</italic> = 7) of the recorded units, and were associated with a particular stimulus, while other stimuli elicited only transient response in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). This stimulus selectivity is consistent with a requirement for a high level of activation to trigger the prolonged firing (see below).</p>
<p>Similarly, prolonged single unit AOB spiking activity could be readily elicited in anesthetized mice by direct stimulation of the vomeronasal nerve with a metal electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), further confirming that the sustained responses are independent of VNO dynamics. Finally, In agreement with our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>], persistent firing could be elicited in AOB mitral cells in brain slices. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">Fig 1D</xref> (top), where a 4 s train of action potentials is followed by a prolonged period of persistent spiking at a rate of 1–3 Hz lasting for over a minute. The reproducibility of this firing epoch is demonstrated by the mean rate response for the three recorded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, bottom). Altogether, these results and the results of our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref020">20</xref>] prove that AOB mitral cells are capable of persistent firing responses, both in vitro and in vivo to either electrical or chemical sensory stimulation.</p>

<title>Persistent Firing Activity in AOB Mitral Cells Involves a Prolonged Depolarizing Current with Complex Dynamics</title>
<p>Conducting the in vitro protocol described above while shifting the membrane potential to −60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) blocked the persistent firing and unmasked a prolonged depolarization with a similar time course as the firing activity (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To analyze the currents underlying the prolonged depolarization, the hybrid-clamp methodology was used (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and Methods</xref>). Cells were voltage-clamped to −80 mV and trains of action potentials at various frequencies were delivered during a 4 s long current-clamp period. The evoked inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) comprised an initial, rapidly decaying phase (<italic>transient phase</italic>, enlarged in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), followed by a second, prolonged phase (<italic>persistent phase</italic>), that peaked after &gt;10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, arrows) and slowly decayed with a more prolonged time course (&gt;30 s). Notably, the charge transfer during each of the phases monotonically increased with the stimulus frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, the prolonged inward current underlying persistent firing in AOB mitral cells seems to involve transient and persistent components that are proportional to the firing frequency during the stimulation.</p>

<title>The Prolonged Inward Current Is the Sum of a Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> Pump-Mediated Outward Current and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Inward Current (I<sub>CAN</sub>)</title>
<p>The complex dynamics of the prolonged inward current suggest that multiple biophysical mechanisms are involved. To isolate the participating processes, we abolished the inward current, previously shown to be mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, CAN conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>]. Removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular solution, as well as blocking the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by adding 5 mM BAPTA to the pipette solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s003">S2 Fig</xref>), abolished the prolonged inward current. Under these conditions, the stimulating train was followed by an outward current of 18±3 pA that monotonically decayed with a single time constant (τ = 5±1 s, <italic>n</italic> = 11 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, green trace). Subtracting the outward current from the control condition current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, blue trace) yields a net inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, black trace), which is likely due to the CAN conductance. Similar results were previously obtained by blocking N/R type voltage-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, the outward current measured in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions was independent of membrane potential, suggesting that it is not mediated by ionic conductance. The most likely candidate for a voltage-insensitive outward current is an ionic pump current, such as the one produced by the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump (Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref021">21</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2G</xref> (green), blocking the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump using ouabain unmasks a strong net inward current peaking immediately after the spike train. The difference between the currents before and after ouabain application is a net outward current resembling the one measured in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, black). Thus, the outward current is most likely mediated by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump.</p>
<p>Overall, these data suggest that the complex dynamics of the prolonged inward current reflect the sum of two opposing currents—a voltage-independent outward current (Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump) decaying over a few seconds and a prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inward current (I<sub>CAN</sub>) that remains active for minutes.</p>

<title>The Magnitude of the Inward Current Is Correlated with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at the Dendritic Tuft</title>
<p>To study the spatio-temporal relationship between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and I<sub>CAN</sub>, we correlated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> indicator fluorescence in various cellular compartments with the simultaneously recorded somatic inward current. To that end, AOB mitral cells were filled with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator using the patch pipette (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Then, tuft fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and the corresponding inward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) were simultaneously monitored as trains of action potentials at various frequencies were delivered via the patch pipette to activate the neurons. The transient increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the dendritic tuft was followed by an extremely prolonged decay lasting longer than the interval between stimuli, resulting in summation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels over consecutive trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Similarly, the prolonged inward current also persisted longer than the interval between stimuli, resulting in progressive increase in inward current as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

Inset: fluorescence microscope image of the mitral cell filled with OGB-1, showing the dendritic tuft from which the signals were recorded (red circle). Scale bar is 50 μm. The fluorescence level recorded before the first train (dashed line) was used as F<sub>min</sub> to calculate dF/F values ([F-F<sub>min</sub>] / F<sub>min</sub>). (B) Current traces recorded simultaneously along with the fluorescence signals shown in (A). (C) A scatter plot of the recorded current (B), calculated relative to the current recorded before the first train, versus the simultaneously recorded dendritic tuft fluorescent signal (A), color coded as in (A) and (B). The data of the first 7 s following each spike train were discarded. A sigmoid curve was fitted to the data (dashed line). (D) Same as (C), with somatic fluorescence signals. (E) The mean fluorescence signal in the dendritic tuft during responses to 15 Hz (blue) and 30 Hz spike trains (green). Both signals can be modeled as a sum of two exponential functions (gray lines), one having a short time constant (~2 s) and the other a very long one (~200 s).

<p>To analyze the relationship between dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and the inward current, the current amplitude at each time point was plotted against the simultaneously measured fluorescence level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3C</xref> shows this analysis, applied to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>. As apparent, the inward current shows a clear sigmoidal dependence on the fluorescence signal, suggesting that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the dendritic tuft tightly correlates with the slow dynamics of inward current (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s004">S3E and S3F Fig</xref> for more examples). In contrast to tuft fluorescence, somatic fluorescence does not correlate with the magnitude of the inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s004">S3A and S3D Fig</xref>). The close relationship between tuft [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and the magnitude of the inward current suggests that the prolonged current reflects the extended elevation of tuft [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Indeed, close examination of tuft fluorescence levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) revealed that the decay of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the tuft followed two distinct time scales: fast initial decay (τ = 1.9 s, mean of three cells) followed by very slow decay (τ = 47.0 s). This slow process suggests that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is in a quasi-stable state, the level of which is determined by the stimulus frequency. Consistent with this, increasing the stimulation frequency from 15 Hz to 30 Hz almost doubled the quasi-stable state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, blue and green traces).</p>
<p>Overall, these results suggest that the inward current underlying persistent firing of AOB mitral cells is mediated by dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ionic conductance (CAN) and that its slow dynamics likely reflect a complex interaction between several ionic extrusion mechanisms.</p>

<title>A Hypothetical Mechanism Involving the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> Pump, the Plasma Membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> Pump, and the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> Exchanger Can Explain the Observed Slow Current Dynamics</title>
<p>The result described above, in which the tuft [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decays to a quasi-stable state determined by the stimulation frequency, suggests that the quasi-stable state is generated by slowly changing, activity-dependent quantity. One such quantity may be the tuft [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which affects the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics by interacting with ionic transport mechanisms such as the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger. This exchanger, which is the major mechanism for control of large excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref022">22</xref>], uses the Na<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient to extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, increase in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> which leads to a decreased Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, reduce or even reverse the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the exchanger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref023">23</xref>]. We examined this possibility in a simple abstract dynamical model, with a minimal number of parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s001">S1 Text</xref> for a description of the model equations). In this model, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase at a rate proportional to an abstract “voltage” quantity, given that the “voltage” is above a certain threshold. [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decays exponentially to zero over time, while [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decays to a level linearly determined by [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (the quasi-stable state). The “voltage” is a sum of three components: externally applied current, inward Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent current, and outward (negative) Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent “pump” current.</p>

<title>A Conductance-Based Model Reproduces the Dynamics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Fluorescence and the Membrane Currents</title>
<p>A realistic conductance-based model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and Methods</xref>), was constructed using the detailed morphology of a single typical mitral cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s005">S4 Fig</xref>) for which the electrophysiological properties were characterized. The model assumes that active conductances reside in the apical dendrites and dendritic tufts, as well as in the soma and axon initial segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref024">24</xref>], so that [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase in these compartments following firing. A novel feature of our model is the incorporation of compartmental [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> as state variables along with longitudinal ionic diffusion. Accordingly, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> not only sets the local Na<sup>+</sup> reversal potential but also affects localized ionic extrusion mechanisms (Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pumps, Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, buffering and extrusion mechanisms (including a simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator), as well as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent conductance, were introduced in the dendritic tufts. The spatial distribution of membranal mechanisms in the model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g004">Fig 4E</xref> (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and Methods</xref> for a link to the model source code and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s001">S1 Text</xref> for a full description of the model equations and parameters).

<p>An evolutionary multi-objective algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref026">26</xref>] was used to find the biophysical parameters that best fit our electrophysiological observations. An initial evolutionary process was employed to find the best fit to the following measured parameters: the response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), the shape of the action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), the modulation of the spike amplitude during a strong (350 pA) current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">Fig 5G</xref>), and the I-f curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). As shown, the model accurately reproduces the behavior of the real cell with respect to these objectives. Notably, the spike amplitude modulation during depolarizing current injection simulated by the model precisely fitted the experimental observations, despite the fact that only a 350 pA current injection was used as an objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">Fig 5E–5G</xref>).

<p>The goal of the next evolutionary process was to find the parameters that reproduce the tuft Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator fluorescence and the prolonged somatic inward current (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and Methods</xref>). Trains of action potentials with frequencies of 1, 15, and 30 Hz were used to activate the model neuron.

At a frequency of 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), the simulation (red line) perfectly reproduced the observed fluorescence signal (blue line).

<p>In order to assess the sensitivity of the model to changes in its parameters, we created a population of 1,200 model neurons. In each model, each parameter (except the channels' half-activation voltage parameters) was randomly selected from a uniform distribution that spanned between -10% and +10% relative to the original value. We then examined, in each of the models, the predicted prolonged inward currents evoked by 30Hz spike train. The properties of the resulting currents distribute normally (see example histograms for the maximum current in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s007">S6A Fig</xref> and the residual current after 1 min for the train end in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s007">S6B Fig</xref>). As apparent from the 80% bounds of the distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s007">S6C Fig</xref>), this change in parameters did not cause a large deviation from the fit of the model to the experimental data.</p>
<p>A critical validation of the model is its ability to reproduce the persistent firing recorded in AOB mitral cells. Indeed, a train of simulated spikes evoked long lasting persistent activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) which resembled the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Adding Gaussian current noise introduced variability to the responses that upon averaging reproduced the PSTH observed in vitro (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">6E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g001">1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Another critical validation is the ability of the model to predict the time course of dendritic [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and particularly its rise during stimulation and very slow subsequent decay that maintains a quasi-stable state for the tuft [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. To that end, we used two fluorescent Na<sup>+</sup> indicators, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI) and Sodium Green, to image the dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> dynamics following a stimulus train [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref027">27</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, the averaged observed dynamics (thick green line) indeed match the predicted dynamics (red line) (For dF/F signal not normalized by standard deviation and similar results using the Sodium Green indicator, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s008">S7 Fig</xref>) As shown in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX,blue lines), the signal does relate to opening of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Notably, similar dynamics were previously observed experimentally in cortical pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref027">27</xref>].</p>

<title>The Quasi-stable State of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the Dendritic Tuft Reflects the Opposing Actions of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> Pump and the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> Exchanger</title>
<p>We used this model to examine possible mechanisms underlying the prolonged current responses of AOB mitral cells. We first examined the time course of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in two cellular compartments: the axon initial segment (AIS) and the dendritic tuft, while the model neuron was activated by a 4 s train of 15 or 30 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, orange and red traces, respectively). The model predicts that during the stimulus, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at the AIS (dashed lines) would reach a very high level (50 and 63 mM for 15 and 30 Hz stimulation, respectively), followed by a relatively rapid decline (τ = 3.85 s) to baseline levels. The large increase in AIS [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is due to the high density of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and the limited volume of the compartment. The relatively fast recovery results from the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump and the fast diffusion to the compartments adjacent to the AIS (axon and soma) that serve as diffusion sinks.</p>

<p>In contrast to the AIS, tuft [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increased only to a moderate level (15 and 17 mM for 15 and 30 Hz stimulation—solid orange and red traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, respectively), followed by extremely slow exponential recovery over a time course of minutes (τ = 130 s and 115 s for 15 and 30 Hz stimulation, respectively). This slow time course, also observed in real mitral cells using Na<sup>+</sup> fluorescent indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), stems from the slow diffusion in the thin dendritic process and the low density of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pumps in this compartment.</p>
<p>The prolonged elevated [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the dendritic tuft is bound to affect the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, hence to determine the quasi-stable state of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. We examined this prediction using the model by calculating the stable-state [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> for various fixed [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i.</sub> values. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7B</xref> (inset), an increase in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevated the stable-state [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> non-linearly. This relationship was used to calculate the quasi-stable state of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during and after the stimulation train, based on the instantaneous values of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7B</xref> for stimulation frequencies of 15 Hz and 30 Hz, the simulated tuft [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (solid lines) quickly dropped to its quasi-stable state level (dashed lines), and then closely followed the slow decrease of the quasi-stable state. The proposed mechanism that maintains [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in a quasi-stable state level is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>, where the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents of the exchanger (dashed green line) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump (dashed orange line) are shown along with schematic diagrams depicting each state. Immediately following the stimulus train, both currents are positive (outward, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, middle), but then the exchanger current becomes negative (inward) while the pump current remains positive. As a result, the net current of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory mechanisms reaches a near-zero value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, right). The inward current mediated by the exchanger reflects the condition of high [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> level, that causes the exchanger to operate in a "reverse mode" (Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx). In this state [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is determined by the slow change of the quasi-stable state, which is due to the slow return of tuft [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> back to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

<title>Blocking the Exchanger by Substituting Na<sup>+</sup> with Li<sup>+</sup> Shortens the Duration of Tuft Ca<sup>2+</sup> Elevation and the Inward Current</title>
<p>As described above, the prolonged quasi-stable state of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is the result of the opposing actions of the pump Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx due to the reverse-mode of the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>).

<p>The unitary synaptic response of an AOB mitral cell to sensory fiber stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, blue line) was measured by stimulating the dendritic tuft of a mitral cell (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Materials and Methods</xref>, micrograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). A model of synaptic conductance was fitted to the averaged response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, orange line) and assigned to the dendritic tufts of the aforementioned mitral cell model. The simulated response was then tested for two ligands presented simultaneously to two groups of 13 VSNs, converging on two different dendritic tufts of the model mitral cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). This simulation was run using a range of stimulus durations for both ligands, and a range of concentrations for one of them (the concentration of the second ligand was kept constant). Random white noise was also injected to the model mitral cell. Using these parameters, we encountered two possible outcomes: one was a transient firing response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9D</xref>) while in the other firing persisted for ~200 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9E</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9F</xref> summarizes the average firing durations for different combinations of stimulus duration and concentration. As shown, longer stimulus durations and higher concentrations led to persistent firing responses. The bimodal distribution of the response duration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g009">Fig 9G</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we combined in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> imaging, and computational modeling to investigate how persistent firing responses are generated in AOB mitral cells. We first demonstrated that these cells are capable of responding in vivo with persistent firing to natural stimuli applied to the VNO, in a stimulus-specific manner. We then used AOB slices to explore the ohmic and non-ohmic currents that underlie the persistent firing responses. The dynamics and inter-relationships of these current sources were analyzed by pharmacological and ionic manipulations. By combining patch-clamp recordings with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> imaging we showed that the dynamics of the currents underlying persistent firing rely on slow changes in internal ionic concentrations within specific cellular compartments. Using first abstract and then realistic computational models of AOB mitral cell we demonstrated that these changes are governed by passive diffusion, as well as by local active processes involving ionic pumps and exchangers. The model results accurately predict the persistent firing responses, the dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup> in the dendrites and the results of substituting Na<sup>+</sup> by Li<sup>+</sup>. Finally, we employed our model in a local network simulation and established that the model cell indeed shifts between transient and persistent firing responses to stimuli detected by VNO neurons, as a function of the duration and strength of stimulation.</p>

<title>Functional Significance of Persistent Activity in AOB Mitral Cells</title>
<p>We have previously hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>] that the accessory olfactory system reports the social context to an animal by inducing specific brain states based on the persistent activity of its mitral cells. These states can then change the processing of sensory information in other brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref038">38</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by the current study where we showed, both in vivo and in vitro that AOB mitral cells shift from transient to persistent firing responses to stimuli arriving from the VNO. In agreement with our previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref020">20</xref>], this transition is relatively sharp and depends on sufficient stimulus strength and duration. This may correspond, for example, to the presence of a rich source of social chemosensory cues, e.g., a conspecific animal, which would elicit persistent firing in AOB mitral cells, thereby conveying to higher brain centers the presence of a social partner.</p>

<title>A Novel Mechanism for Persistent Activity</title>
<p>Persistent activity has been reported in several brain areas, including mitral cells of the main olfactory bulb in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref039">39</xref>], and was suggested to mediate working memory or prolonged brain states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref004">4</xref>]. To date, most of the mechanisms purposed for persistent activity include either network or biophysical feedback loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref040">40</xref>]. We propose a novel mechanism for persistent neuronal activity in AOB mitral cells, in which a train of action potentials that back-propagate to the dendritic tuft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref024">24</xref>] elevates the tuft [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. This increase in the tuft [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> shifts the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> stable state upwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref029">29</xref>], thus creating an elevated quasi-stable state for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The slow decay of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is dictated by the slow removal of Na<sup>+</sup> ions from the tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The novelty of our model is in the absence of biochemical, biophysical, or network feedback mechanisms or hysteresis.</p>

<title>Exploring Alternative Mitral Cell Models</title>
<p>Two alternative models were examined in an attempt to reproduce the observed experimental results. One model incorporated two distinct CAN conductances—a fast one and a slow one (compare with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref041">41</xref>]), without activity-dependent outward current. Each of these currents produces a different phase of the observed inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). While this model reproduces the results used as objectives in the model training phase (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">6A–6C</xref>), it failed to produce the persistent activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>), emphasizing the importance of this validation. The long time constant kept the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent current away from its stable-state value in the hybrid clamp simulations, but this current would greatly intensify and cause a runaway effect in a current clamp simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s009">S8A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In another model, a single Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent non-specific cation conductance was used, along with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductance (SK/BK) that account for the outward current observed immediately after the stimulating train of action potentials. Although this model reproduces the results used as objectives in the model training phase (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">6A–6C</xref>), it failed to explain the outward current recorded in the absence of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>The ultimate rejection of these models demonstrates the importance of the model validation step.</p>

<title>The Role of Na<sup>+</sup> As an Integrator of Spiking Activity</title>
<p>According to our results, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> plays a key role in both transient and prolonged biophysical processes. First, increase in AIS [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> alters the Na<sup>+</sup> Nernst potential, thus lowering the spike amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g005">Fig 5E–5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). Second, elevation in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump-mediated outward current that terminates bursts of activity by hyperpolarizing the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Third, increase in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux by modulating the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The latter endows [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> with the ability to dictate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and thus the inward I<sub>CAN</sub>.</p>
<p>In thin and slightly active processes like the dendritic tuft, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is only moderately increased by neuronal activity and its extrusion is exceptionally slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g006">Fig 6F</xref>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref027">27</xref>]). Thus, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can attain a range of quasi-stable states—a property that renders it an ideal candidate to integrate epochs of high neural activity. This is in contrast to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which is highly dynamic as a function of neuronal activity on one hand, and rapid extrusion on the other.</p>
<p>Notably, changes in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> are rarely tracked in conductance-based models (important exceptions in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref045">45</xref>]), although in thin active processes, such as axons and dendrites, they may substantially affect neuronal activity. Indeed, the effects of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> on a variety of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes were previously demonstrated: reducing Na<sup>+</sup> extrusion or inhibiting the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger were shown to extend [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transients, and thus to facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms, such as synaptic plasticity and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>The activity-dependent Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump-mediated outward current is an important factor protecting neurons from a runaway positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002319.s009">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>). Without this current, the high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during and immediately after stimulation would result in a strong inward current (as demonstrated using ouabain—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, red line) that would in turn evoke high frequency spiking, and thus a further increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec017">
<title>Relevance to Other Brain Areas</title>
<p>Since the mechanism described here contains mostly elements which are ubiquitous in neurons, we argue that it is relevant (wholly or partially) to other brain areas. The essential non-trivial building blocks required to produce persistent activity by this mechanism are: a) changes in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in thin processes (axon or dendrites), attained by (back)-propagation of action potentials and/or excitatory synaptic activity; b) Co-localization of an excitatory Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent conductance at the site of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes; c) Low density of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> active extrusion mechanisms at the site of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes.</p>
<p>Thus, the proposed mechanism is very likely to explain persistent activity in other brain areas, most likely with some variation of the time scale and of the factors necessary to evoke it. For example, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics may take alternative forms in other neuronal types, as a function of the spatial distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> channels and Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pumps as well as cell morphology. Moreover, the persistent activity may be either superthreshold, i.e. persistent firing, or long term integrative changes in membrane potential and excitability. It may be assumed that very slow changes in resting potential or firing rate, such as those produced by the mechanism presented here, may be under-reported because they are frequently filtered out and require prolonged recording sessions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the importance of the mechanism proposed by us is beyond the scope of persistent activity. We show that the long-term behavior of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> depends upon past activity—an idea previously presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref029">29</xref>], though in a much shorter time scale. Given that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an important cellular signaling molecule, long-term changes in its concentration may broaden the time scale of processes such as synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref047">47</xref>], activity-dependent gene expression, and more. Similarly to membrane potential changes, reports about [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes may also suffer from "time-scale bias," wherein long-term changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> seems to be regularly filtered out or not recorded due to photo damage and dye-bleaching concerns.</p>
<p>An even broader consequence is the ability of Na<sup>+</sup> to integrate activity (discussed above), which at the very least causes changes to Na<sup>+</sup> reversal potential. Thus, persistent activity is only one of several end results of the mechanism we describe. Our results at least demonstrate that changes in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> should not be regarded as negligible in conceptual and computational models of neuronal activity.</p>

A pump was turned on 40 s after each stimulus presentation, followed (after 10 s) by application of Ringer’s solution (1–2 ml) to the nostril that was flushed through the nasopalatine duct to cleanse the nasal cavity. 20 s after Ringer's application sympathetic stimulation was performed to ensure the VNO lumen cleansing (the second stimulation).</p>

Whole-cell recordings were performed using borosilicate pipettes filled with standard intracellular recording solution containing the following (mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 Na-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and 4 NaCl (pH = 7.25 with KOH, 5–12 MΩ). When BAPTA was used, BAPTA—tetrapotassium (Sigma) was dissolved in this solution to a final concentration of 5 mM. Seal resistance was at least 2 GΩ and typically 5–10 GΩ.</p>
<p>In most experiments, a 4-s-long spike train was evoked by injecting a series of depolarizing pulses (rate, 1–30 Hz; amplitude, 1–2 nA; pulse duration, 10 ms). In the hybrid-clamp procedure, membrane potential was clamped to −80 or −70mV throughout the experiment, excluding 4 s periods during which the amplifier was switched to current-clamp mode to deliver the train of current pulses. It should be noted that the hybrid-clamp methodology has been proven useful for investigating the firing activity of neurons, since by preventing most of the feedback and interference that ongoing firing activity may elicit upon itself, it enables a relatively clean examination of the underlying currents.</p>
<p>All amplified signals were digitized at 2–20 kHz using a National Instruments board and homemade software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments).</p>
<p>A unitary measurement of EPSC was done by filling a cell with Alexa 488 (Life Technologies) and visually positioning a bipolar theta electrode filled with physiological solution and Alexa 488 close to one of the dendritic tufts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).</p>

<title>Calcium Imaging</title>
<p>For calcium imaging experiments, Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1, Life Technologies, 50 μM) was added to the pipette solution. Fluorescence signals were recorded during the hybrid clamp protocol using a high speed camera (MiCAM Ultima, Brainvisions) and converted to (<italic>F−F</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub>)/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub>ratio after subtracting the ongoing background signal. In order to perform imaging of the dendritic tuft, a 60x water-immersion objective was used, and the dye was allowed to fill the cell for &gt;20 min before recording was started. Evoked spikes were used to increase fluorescence and facilitate the visual search for a dendritic tuft.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Sodium Imaging</title>
<p>For sodium imaging experiments, SBFI salt (TEFLabs, 2mM) and Sodium Green salt (Life Technologies, 500uM) was added to a modified pipette solution containing (mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 5 phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 20 KCl, and 0.2 EGTA (pH = 7.2 with KOH, 5–12 MΩ). Fluorescence signals were recorded from the apical dendrite as in the case of calcium imaging. A standard Fura-2 filter set (Ex. 380 nm; Em. 510 nm, Chroma Technology) was used for SBFI imaging. In order to cancel the substantial dye bleaching, trials without stimulus were subtracted from stimulus trials.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, recorded current or voltage traces were averaged for each recorded cell, and the presented result is the mean of the cell population.</p>
<p>Value error range reported is SEM unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>For stimulus-induced in vivo AOB recordings, units from various sets of experiments were considered. Six hundred and sixty-three single units for which at least one stimulus was presented at least five times were considered. The procedure for identifying persistent responses was as follows: For each single trace (one unit, one presentation of one stimulus), the responses in consecutive 2 s bins were defined as significant if the rate within it was larger than the mean baseline rate by at least five times the SEM of the baseline rate. The bins spanned a period of 160 s, which includes the baseline period, stimulus delivery, and the VNO flushing period, extending 20 s after the sympathetic stimulation during flushing (second stimulation, see above). The response duration was defined as a period beginning and ending with a significant bin, and in which at least 85% of the bins were significant. If this response lasted more than 10 s following the second sympathetic stimulation, it was designated as a persistent response. Finally, units for which at least half of the responses were persistent for a given stimulus were defined as persistent.</p>
<p>The seven persistent firing units came from three sets of experiments differing in stimulus sets used. For three units the stimuli were undiluted saliva, urine, and vaginal secretions. In three other units the stimuli were saliva, 100F diluted urine, and vaginal secretions. For the remaining units, the stimuli were urine at 1F, 10F, and 30F dilutions.</p>

It assumed a presence of active Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the apical dendrites and tufts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref024">24</xref>], as well as non-uniform channel properties across different compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref055">55</xref>]).

<title>Network Model</title>
<p>In order to test the response of the model mitral cell to natural stimuli, a simple two-layer network model was constructed. The firing response of the VNO sensory neurons was modeled using a simple ligand-receptor interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref033">33</xref>] that triggers a semi-random spike train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Thirteen of such sensory neurons converged on each of the mitral cell's dendritic tufts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002319.ref035">35</xref>], where the synaptic current was modeled using a double exponential fit to the unitary response measured experimentally using a theta electrode (a bipolar micropipette pulled from a tubing with a θ-like cross-section) positioned next to a dye-filled mitral cell's dendritic tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002319.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).</p>
