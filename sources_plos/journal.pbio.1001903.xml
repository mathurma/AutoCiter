<p>Long-term potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic transmission controls synaptic integration and action potential generation of specific neocortical neurons.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>In the neocortex, the coexistence of temporally locked excitation and inhibition governs complex network activity underlying cognitive functions, and is believed to be altered in several brain diseases. Here we show that this equilibrium can be unlocked by increased activity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the mouse neocortex. Somatic depolarization or short bursts of action potentials of layer 5 pyramidal neurons induced a selective long-term potentiation of GABAergic synapses (LTPi) without affecting glutamatergic inputs. Remarkably, LTPi was selective for perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin basket cells, leaving dendritic inhibition intact. It relied on retrograde signaling of nitric oxide, which persistently altered presynaptic GABA release and diffused to inhibitory synapses impinging on adjacent pyramidal neurons. LTPi reduced the time window of synaptic summation and increased the temporal precision of spike generation. Thus, increases in single cortical pyramidal neuron activity can induce an interneuron-selective GABAergic plasticity effectively altering the computation of temporally coded information.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The proper activity of cortical neurons (the brain cells responsible for memory and consciousness) relies on the precise integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The excitation and inhibition (E/I) ratio has to remain constant both in time and strength to prevent neurological and psychiatric diseases. Fast inhibitory synaptic inputs to cortical pyramidal neurons originate from a rich diversity of GABAergic interneurons that operate a strict division of labor by differentially targeting precise regions of the pyramidal neurons. Here, we show that large pyramidal neurons of neocortical layer 5 can unlock the E/I ratio in response to their own activity. Excitatory activity of pyramidal neurons, in the form of membrane depolarization or trains of action potentials, induces a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mobilization of nitric oxide, which diffuses to inhibitory synapses and triggers a persistent enhancement of GABA release. Notably, this potentiation of inhibition is specific for synapses originating from parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons that target mainly the perisomatic region of pyramidal neurons. Long-term potentiation of perisomatic inhibition, in turn, changes the ability of pyramidal neurons to integrate excitatory inputs as well as the temporal properties of their own action potential output. Selective plasticity of perisomatic inhibition can thus play a crucial role in cortical activity, such as sensory processing and integration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the cerebral cortex, fast GABAergic inhibition is tightly coupled to excitation both temporally and in strength. This constant balance of opposing forces is necessary for the correct development of cortical sensory receptive fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Dorrn1">[1]</xref> and allows for the generation and tuning of cortical network activity underlying cognitive functions and complex behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Isaacson1">[2]</xref>. Indeed, it has been proposed that alterations of this equilibrium result in devastating neurological and/or psychiatric diseases, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Marin1">[3]</xref>. Studies have shown that dynamic cellular mechanism are capable of compensating changes in synaptic excitation in order to maintain a particular excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio intact, for example, either by weakening of feed-forward inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-House1">[4]</xref> or persistently enhancing inhibitory neurons' excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Campanac1">[5]</xref>. Nevertheless, perturbations in the E/I balance can play a key role in sensory learning and receptive field reorganization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Froemke1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Gambino1">[7]</xref>, suggesting it may be necessary to unlock the restrictive gate on the E/I balance. However, no such cellular mechanisms have been demonstrated. Moreover, the E/I ratio is remarkably different across cortical layers, resulting in layer-specific suppression or augmentation of pyramidal neuron output in response to sustained input activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Adesnik1">[8]</xref>. Thus, E/I ratios can be state-dependent and regulated according to computational requirements of specific microcircuit pathways.</p>
<p>In principle, short- and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity of either inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmission could be responsible for dynamically altering the E/I ratio of specific cortical networks. This is especially true for cortical GABAergic synapses as they originate from a rich diversity of interneuron types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Ascoli1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Mendez1">[10]</xref>, which may differentially modulate the excitatory information flow along the dendro-somatic axis of pyramidal neurons.</p>
<p>In this context, alteration of the E/I ratio might have important and specific consequences in input–output transformations of pyramidal neurons and their ability to integrate and relay different salient features of sensory information. Although the E/I ratio is usually referred to as a “global” balance, it is not known whether specific inhibitory circuits can induce region-specific unlocking of this equilibrium.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we have previously found that layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons can self-tune their excitability and inhibitory synaptic strength solely in response to their own activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Marinelli1">[11]</xref>. Whether this mechanism can alter the E/I balance is not known.</p>
<p>Here we show that in contrast to layer 2/3, single layer 5 pyramidal neurons' activity alone can alter E/I balance by inducing long-term potentiation of perisomatic inhibitory GABAergic transmission (LTPi) while leaving the strength of glutamatergic inputs unchanged. Moreover, this plasticity is specific for inhibition originating from parvalbumin (PV)-positive basket cells and not somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons, which target distal dendrites. Physiological burst-firing patterns of pyramidal neurons are sufficient to induce retrograde signaling of nitric oxide (NO), which increases GABA release from NO-sensitive PV presynaptic terminals. This non-associative potentiation of perisomatic GABAergic synapses results in an efficient layer 5 alteration of the balance between excitation and inhibition, reducing firing probability and, importantly, markedly sharpening the time window of synaptic integration. This activity-dependent auto-modulation of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons is ideally suited to enhance sparseness and improve the precision of time-coded information processing in a region-specific manner.</p>

<title>Postsynaptic Depolarization of Layer V Pyramidal Neurons Selectively Potentiates GABAergic Inputs</title>
<p>We examined whether layer 5 pyramidal neurons can modulate the strength of GABAergic synapses by postsynaptic depolarization similarly to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Marinelli1">[11]</xref>, and if also glutamatergic transmission could be altered by postynaptic depolarization protocols. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons were evoked by extracellularly stimulating their perisomatic afferents, in the continuous presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist DNQX (10 µm). Surprisingly, in contrast to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Marinelli1">[11]</xref>, which responded to repeated somatic depolarizing steps with LTDi, a similar protocol (ten 5-s long steps to 0 mV, repeated every 30 s from a holding potential of −70 mV) induced a robust increase in the amplitude of eIPSCs onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons. LTPi persisted for &gt;30 min (eIPSCs baseline, 260.1±24.03 pA; eIPSCs 20 min after steps, 517.4±77.50 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 16, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0045, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>; normalized changes of eIPSCs, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; ΔeIPSCs amplitude = 129.0±40.7%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), and interestingly, it occurred in the absence of any presynaptic stimulation during somatic depolarizing steps (non-associative LTPi). An increase in eIPSCs amplitude of at least 50% of eIPSCs baseline amplitude was present in 71 out of 101 (control or vehicle) tested layer 5 pyramidal neurons (71.7%; e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, LTPi-inducing protocols failed to induce long-term plasticity of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic responses, which were isolated in the continuous presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist gabazine (baseline, 161.6±22.08 pA; after steps, 178±21.86 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.3355, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). This potentiation of inhibitory but not excitatory synapses likely results in an unbalanced E/I ratio (see below).</p>

<title>Postsynaptic Action Potential (AP) Firing Efficiently Induces LTPi</title>
<p>Although layer 5 pyramidal neurons fire rather irregularly during awake asynchronous states, they commonly display high-frequency (&gt;100 Hz) burst firing depending on the behavioral state of the animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-deKock1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Helmchen1">[13]</xref>. We therefore tested if short bursts of APs (induced by somatic current injections) could increase GABAergic synaptic strength, similarly to somatic depolarizations in voltage clamp. We recorded pharmacologically isolated evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (eIPSPs) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons, in current-clamp mode with physiological intracellular chloride (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Repeated bursts of APs (5–10 spikes, at 50 or 100 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) efficiently increased GABAergic transmission onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons [1.8±0.4 versus 2.92±0.63 mV, baseline versus after 20 min after AP bursts (10 AP at 50 Hz), respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004, Wilcoxon signed rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g002">Figure 2A–D</xref>]. Interestingly, repeated 1-s-long AP bursts at 50 Hz failed to induce GABAergic plasticity (3.95±0.86 versus 3.53±0.66 mV, baseline versus after 20 min after AP bursts, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29 Wilcoxon signed rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). These experiments indicate that LTPi can be induced in current clamp by short postsynaptic bursts of APs alone. Taken together, these results show a non-associative form of LTP of inhibitory synapses onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons: inhibition is increased by postsynaptic activity without the requirement of concomitant presynaptic stimulation.</p>

<title>LTPi Is Selectively Expressed at Perisomatic GABAergic Synapses from PV Cells</title>
<p>In cortical structures, including the neocortex, perisomatic and dendritic GABAergic inhibition is provided by distinct interneuron types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Ascoli1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Freund1">[14]</xref>. We therefore sought to identify if LTPi was a general property of GABAergic synapses or if it was present at a specific inhibitory circuit. First, perisomatic and dendritic GABAergic synapses were evoked [in the continuous presence of DNQX (10 µM)] in the same neuron by placing two stimulation electrodes near pyramidal neurons' cell bodies (proximal, perisomatic stimulation) and at a distal (∼400 µm) dendritic location, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The integrity of dendrites was confirmed by visual inspection under IR-DIC video microscopy. In some cases, neurons were filled with the fluorescent dye Alexa 594 (20 µM) or with neurobiotin for post hoc histological reconstructions (unpublished data).</p>

<p>In paired recordings between PV cells and pyramidal neurons, repeated depolarizing steps of postsynaptic pyramidal neurons potentiated unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs) in 7 out of 10 pairs (ΔuIPSC LTPi, 59.18±24.63%, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0371, Wilcoxon signed rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g003">Figure 3D–E</xref>).

<title>LTPi Is Expressed Presynaptically</title>
<p>Previous results indicated that postsynaptic depolarization of layer 5 visual cortical pyramidal neurons from hyperpolarized membrane potential (−90 mV) can induce long-term plasticity of GABAergic neurotransmission due to alterations of postsynaptic trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kurotani1">[22]</xref>.

Therefore we decided to investigate the locus of expression of the LTPi described here. We found that LTPi (10 out of 16 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) was accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of spontaneous (s)IPSCs (baseline, 6.9±0.99 Hz; after steps, 8.9±1.04 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0135, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>, left panel) with no changes in their amplitudes (baseline, 37.66±5.5 pA; after steps, 35.74±5.9 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.49, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel). If LTPi resulted from increased GABA<sub>A</sub>R function at postsynaptic sites, a change in quantal synaptic event amplitudes would be apparent. In fact, amplitudes of miniature (m)IPSCs (recorded in 0.5 µM TTX) were unchanged by somatic LTPi-inducing depolarizing steps (baseline, 15.63±1.8 pA; after steps, 15.90±1.8 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, similarly to sIPSCs, mIPSC frequency also increased in response to LTPi-inducing depolarizing steps (13.29±3.8 versus 19.39±5.9 Hz, baseline versus 20 min after steps; <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>Accordingly, coefficient of variation (CV) analysis of uIPSCs obtained from connected PV-basket cells and pyramidal neurons revealed that five out of seven pairs exhibiting LTPi had a purely presynaptic locus of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Moreover, the ratio of PV-cell–induced uIPSCs elicited at a short time interval (20 ms, paired-pulse ratio, or PPR) significantly decreased after LTPi (baseline, 1.1±0.06; after steps, 0.9±0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Also extracellularly evoked IPSCs increased their CV and decreased their PPR, following LTPi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s001">Figure S1B</xref>,C,D), consistent with a presynaptic locus of plasticity.

<p>To examine whether postsynaptic GABAergic plasticity also contributes to LTPi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kurotani1">[22]</xref>, we performed single photon photolysis of the caged GABA compound Rubi–GABA (20 µM) before and after LTPi, using a 5 µm laser spot (λ = 488 nm) positioned at the perisomatic region of layer 5 pyramidal neuron. Photolysis-evoked IPSCs (pIPSCs) were elicited with 1 ms laser pulses, producing baseline current amplitudes ranging between 25 and 160 pA. Following the same somatic depolarization used to induce LTPi, we did not detect alterations in the amplitude of pIPSCs (85.22±10.9 pA baseline and 97.92±14.73 pA after step depolarization, <italic>n</italic> = 11; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4I–L</xref>), ruling out a postsynaptic locus of LTPi.</p>

Accordingly, when we blocked PKG with the inhibitor KT5823 (500 nM), LTPi was prevented, in fact producing a significant reduction of eIPSCs after the steps (control, 253.6±47.84 pA versus 442.8±66.60 pA, before versus after depolarizing steps, <italic>n</italic> = 11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, paired <italic>t</italic> test; KT5828, 213.8±30.31 pA versus 150.8±29.89 pA, before versus after depolarizing steps, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.17, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g006">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s004">Figure S4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, all drugs that were used here to affect various steps of NO signaling did not affect basal GABAergic synaptic transmission (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05 in all cases, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s005">Figure S5D</xref>).</p>
<p>If NO is involved in LTPi, then it should diffuse to synapses impinging neighboring neurons, as it has been previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Schuman1">[29]</xref>. We therefore performed simultaneous recordings of two layer 5 pyramidal neurons, separated by various distances. Depolarization of one postsynaptic pyramidal neuron (PN1-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g007">Figure 7A and 7C</xref>) invariably induced a long-term increase of eIPSC amplitudes, as expected (PN1 LTPi amplitude = 170±40.74%, <italic>n</italic> = 11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Interestingly, a significant, persistent increase of GABAergic transmission was also observed on a second, unperturbed cell (PN2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g007">Figure 7A–C</xref>) if it was within 50 µm from the depolarized cell (PN2 LTPi = 70±19.28%, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0156, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In contrast, when the second pyramidal neuron was farther than 50 µm from PN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g007">Figure 7B–C</xref>), GABAergic transmission was unaffected by PN1 depolarizations (PN2 LTPi = 10±7.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.375, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Overall, these results confirm the involvement of NO, which, as a gaseous diffusible messenger, can affect synapses impinging neighboring neurons within the cortical circuit.</p>

<p>We have shown that postsynaptic activity does not potentiate dendritic inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To investigate whether the absence of LTPi at dendritic GABAergic synapses was due to a decrease in the dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] produced by back-propagating APs (bAPs) at distal synapses, we performed two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging while delivering LTPi-inducing bursts of APs. Using the low-affinity calcium indicator OGB-5N, we found that the peak intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient produced by a train of 5 bAPs at 100 Hz decreased along the pyramidal neuron apical dendrite, but not to zero. At ∼500 µm from the soma, corresponding to the location of distal stimulations, the peak change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was still 50% of that in the proximal dendrite (ΔF/F 100 µm, 0.41±0.04 versus ΔF/F 500 µm, 0.22±0.06, <italic>n</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g008">Figure 8A–C</xref>). However, if the 50% smaller dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient at distal dendrites is the major cause for the lack of LTPi, increasing dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] might reveal LTPi at distal synapses. We therefore depolarized pyramidal neurons in voltage clamp, in the presence of intracellular cesium to block K<sup>+</sup> channels, a condition that permits robust depolarization of distal dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Williams1">[30]</xref>. We observed LTPi of perisomatic but not dendritic GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–B), suggesting that the lack of LTPi at distal inhibitory synapses is not due to reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in distal dendrites, but due to a difference downstream.</p>

<p>We considered whether dendrite-targeting interneurons forming distal dendritic GABAergic synapses might lack sensitivity to NO. Therefore, we applied the NO donor SNAP (200 µM, in the continuous presence of the phosphodiesterases inhibitor IBMX, 200 µM) while stimulating dendritic IPSCs that were isolated pharmacologically. We found that, in contrast to perisomatic IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g006">Figure 6B,C</xref>), dendritic GABAergic responses were insensitive to NO (IPSC amplitudes, 100±39.37 and 73.05±17.05 pA; before and 20 min after SNAP application; <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58, Wilcoxon signed rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g008">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>

LTPi induction did not alter resting membrane potential, membrane resistance, firing dynamics, nor somatic AP waveform (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05 in all cases; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s007">Figure S7A</xref>–G). Yet somatic and axonal APs can result from substantially different ion channels. If the terminal AP waveform is changed by NO, this should be reflected by an altered magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the presynaptic bouton. However, two-photon imaging of single AP-evoked presynaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients in PV-cell boutons, did not reveal NO-dependent alterations in their amplitude (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s007">Figure S7H</xref>–K). These experiments, in addition to LTPi-mediated increase of mIPSC frequency (recorded in TTX), suggest that the expression of LTPi is downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, rather than a mechanism mediated by changes in PV-cell excitability.</p>
<p>Altogether, these data indicate that LTPi depends on retrograde NO signaling, which increases GABA release onto depolarized and nearby pyramidal neurons through a GC-dependent PKG activation. Moreover, the lack of dendritic LTPi is due to lack of NO sensitivity of dendrite-targeting interneurons and not failure to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation in distal dendrites.</p>

LTPi-inducing burst firing produced a significant change in the composite PSP waveform.

<p>To measure synaptic integration we then injected postsynaptic pyramidal neurons with artificial excitatory postsynaptic currents (aEPSCs), producing artificial (a)EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, inset). Using this approach, we could measure synaptic integration of temporally controlled, fixed-amplitude synaptic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Gabernet1">[33]</xref>. Indeed, aEPSCs were injected at different intervals from the recorded composite evoked PSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). When aEPSPs and composite PSPs occurred simultaneously (time zero), they summated similarly before and after induction of LTPi (normalized synaptic summation, 0.79±0.085 versus 0.67±0.139, baseline versus after AP bursts; <italic>n</italic> = 12, q = 0.1195, F<sub>(11,10)</sub> = 8.9, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g009">Figure 9B</xref>).

<p>We reasoned that, because distal GABAergic synapses do not express LTPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g003">Figure 3</xref>), activation of distal inputs can be reliably used to measure synaptic integration, before and after potentiation of perisomatic inhibition.

Separate activation of these two pathways was confirmed by the lack of short-term plasticity, when they were activated in voltage clamp at brief time intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001903.s008">Figure S8C</xref>–E). Also in these experiments, LTPi altered proximal PSP waveform (<italic>p</italic> = 0.3187 for PSP peak and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 for PSP areas, before and after LTPi induction; Kruskal–Wallis test; <italic>n</italic> = 12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g009">Figure 9D</xref>).

<title>Long-Term Plasticity of GABAergic Synapses Strongly Affects Pyramidal Neuron Spike Output</title>
<p>How does this alteration of synaptic integration window translate into spike output of layer 5 pyramidal neurons? Perisomatic E/I ratio is strongly reduced after LTPi induction, thereby likely contributing to a modification in the spike probability of pyramidal neurons. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated perisomatic synaptic afferents to layer 5 pyramidal neurons in short trains (5 pulses at 25 Hz). Stimulation intensity was adjusted in order to evoke sporadic firing as a result of EPSP summation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Spike probability was calculated as the number of APs divided by the number of trials at each individual stimulus. We found that the spike probability dramatically decreased after intracellularly evoked, LTPi-inducing AP bursts (5 APs at 25 Hz, repeated 10 times every 1.5 s; spike probability, 0.45±0.05 versus 0.23±0.06, control versus LTPi, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 12, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0043, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g010">Figure 10B–C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons augment perisomatic GABAergic transmission over long timescales (LTPi), in response to increases in their electrical activity (non-associative). Strikingly, we found that LTPi-inducing stimuli selectively potentiated perisomatic GABAergic synapses from PV basket cells, resulting in a decrease of E/I ratio, which altered synaptic integration, reduced firing probability, and increased spike-time precision of layer 5 principal cells. LTPi required postsynaptic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, triggering NO retrograde signaling, which by acting on a GC- and PKG-dependent mechanism increases GABA release.</p>
<p>Previously, Kurotani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kurotani1">[22]</xref> showed that postsynaptic activity (albeit at hyperpolarized potentials) can induce LTP of GABAergic synapses onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons, through altered trafficking of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. However, the plasticity of GABAergic synapses that we report here is fundamentally different as it does not require strong hyperpolarization (up to −90 mV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kurotani1">[22]</xref>), and it relies on increased presynaptic release of neurotransmitter, induced by retrograde NO signaling. In our hands, we could not potentiate postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R functionality, measured by perisomatic GABA uncaging, in response to stimuli that induce LTPi. In addition, we never observed LTD of GABAergic transmission at postsynaptic membrane potentials ranging between −60 and −70 mV, as reported by Kurotani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kurotani1">[22]</xref>. The GABA plasticity we describe here well agrees with the non-Hebbian potentiation that was very recently described at GABAergic thalamic synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Sieber1">[23]</xref>. The apparent discrepancy with Kurotani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kurotani1">[22]</xref> could be due to intrinsic differences in pyramidal neuron populations in different sensory cortices (somatosensory versus visual). In addition, we cannot exclude that pre- and postsynaptic expression of GABAergic plasticity could be induced depending on the neuronal state, preferential innervation by specific interneuron classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Lee1">[35]</xref>, and/or specific firing patterns of pyramidal neurons. It is interesting to consider that various forms of plasticity can coexist, depending on the actual correlated activation of various neuron types during specific cortical network activities. In any case, we demonstrate here that single pyramidal neurons can auto-modulate the strength of afferent GABAergic synapses but not of glutamatergic afferents, in response to their own firing activity.</p>
<p>This LTPi was found in ∼72% of recorded layer 5 pyramidal neurons and varied in magnitude. This variability is similar to that observed in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kurotani1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Nugent1">[28]</xref>), but we cannot rule out the possibility that the recorded neurons exhibit a potentiation that is dependent on the amount of previous activity and hence on the initial plastic state just prior to induction protocols. Alternatively, experimental variability could arise from whole-cell dialysis or a combination of several biological processes, including (<italic>i</italic>) variability in postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases, (<italic>ii</italic>) heterogeneous enzymatic activity and NO mobilization, (<italic>iii</italic>) differential amount of NO production, and (<italic>iv</italic>) presence of tonic GC activity at some presynaptic terminals.</p>

<title>Cellular Mechanism of LTPi</title>
<p>What is the mechanism underlying LTPi in layer 5 pyramidal neurons? Our experiments indicate that NO is involved as a potential retrograde messenger, produced postsynaptically and acting at presynaptic GABAergic terminals. Here we provide several lines of evidence that support this interpretation: (<italic>i</italic>) neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) is often expressed postsynaptically and requires intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>elevations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Garthwaite1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Bredt1">[38]</xref>; (<italic>ii</italic>) pharmacological blockade of NOS as well as disruption of the GC-sensitive, PKG pathway completely prevented LTPi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Crosby1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Nugent1">[28]</xref>; (<italic>iii</italic>) LTPi could be mimicked by a NO donor; and (<italic>iv</italic>) LTPi diffuses to GABAergic synapses, impinging neighboring nonstimulated pyramidal neurons at distances that were compatible with previously described NO-dependent plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cerebellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Schuman1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Jacoby1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Hartell1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Analyses of CV, IPSC PPR, and mIPSC frequency before and after LTPi induction suggest that the expression of LTPi is presynaptic and likely alters release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001903-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Campanac1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Nataraj1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Steinert1">[32]</xref>. We confirmed the presynaptic locus by showing that pIPSCs are not altered after LTPi induction. We did not detect a difference in AP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients recorded from single basket cell boutons before and after NO donor application, suggesting that augmentation of release cannot be due to alterations in presynaptic spike waveform or Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We favor the hypothesis that PKG activation by cGMP alters the synaptic vesicle machinery, thus changing the probability of GABA release, as LTPi was associated with increase of mIPSC frequency in TTX and there was no effect of SNAP on PV-cell excitability and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics.</p>
<p>Anatomical data suggest that nNOS is expressed selectively by small subpopulations of GABAergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Karagiannis1">[41]</xref>, although several lines of evidence indicate that both nNOS mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Kwan1">[42]</xref> and protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Aoki1">[43]</xref> can be present in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We cannot exclude, however, that NO is produced by other NOS isoforms and/or cellular elements present in the neuropil, including nonneuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Buskila1">[44]</xref>. Although expression of nNOs by pyramidal neurons is controversial, it is noteworthy that several forms of glutamatergic LTP rely on NO production, likely from pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Sjostrom1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Hardingham1">[47]</xref>. In any case, here we demonstrate that postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activity alone results in presynaptic alterations via an NO-dependent retrograde signaling.</p>
<p>It will be fundamental to reveal in future studies what minimal firing activity and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are required to induce LTPi. Likewise, it will be important to decipher the molecular pathways underlying its maintenance. Here we show that impairment of GC activity after LTPi induction did not prevent the maintenance of GABAergic plasticity. This indicates that LTPi involves sequential activation of soluble CG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and possibly cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Monfort1">[48]</xref>. This cycle might be important in maintaining a critical cGMP level necessary to sustain LTPi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Monfort1">[48]</xref>.</p>

<title>Selective Potentiation of GABAergic Synapses Originates from Specific Interneuron Types</title>
<p>LTPi expression is likely restricted to perisomatic-targeting GABAergic synapses, as indicated by potentiation of IPSCs originating from FS, PV basket cells (either in paired recordings or optogenetic experiments) by pyramidal neuron depolarization. Moreover, no changes in synaptic strength were observed when evoking GABAergic inhibition at more distal regions and when dendrite-targeting SST interneurons were selectively stimulated optogenetically. One possible explanation for lack of LTPi expression at GABAergic dendritic synapses is an insufficient increase in dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] by bAPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Grewe1">[49]</xref>. Indeed, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevations at 500 µm (location of distal synaptic stimulation) were half the size of those measured from the proximal dendritic compartments. Nevertheless, LTPi was absent in voltage clamp, with intracellular Cs<sup>+</sup>, a condition favoring the dendritic spread of depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Williams1">[30]</xref>. Moreover, the selective lack of effect by the NO donor SNAP on distal GABAergic responses indicates that the absence of LTPi at dendritic synapses can be largely explained by an insensitivity of dendrite-targeting interneurons to NO. Remarkably, in line with our experiments, neocortical expression of the NO receptor GC seems to be preferentially expressed by perisomatic targeting PV basket cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Vruwink1">[50]</xref>.</p>

<title>Compartment-Selective “Unlocking” of E/I Ratio Via LTPi</title>
<p>One major finding of this study is that AP firing and/or depolarization inducing LTPi did not alter glutamatergic synaptic transmission, although NO-dependent forms of glutamatergic plasticity have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Schuman1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Sjostrom1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Hardingham1">[47]</xref>. The activity-dependent self-regulation of GABAergic synapses reported here altered the E/I ratio onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Whereas changes in E/I balance have been commonly associated with pathological states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Marin1">[3]</xref>, here we show that this equilibrium can be altered at the level of single pyramidal neurons, and in an interneuron-selective manner, in response to their physiological firing. Indeed, LTPi was induced by short postsynaptic bursts of APs, commonly observed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> spontaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-deKock1">[12]</xref> and in response to sensory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Helmchen1">[13]</xref>. It will be interesting to test if LTPi can, at least in part, support the hypothesis that short AP bursts can be optimal encoders of sensory information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Lisman1">[51]</xref>. Indeed, top-down, feedback sensory inputs in distal dendrites increase the tendency of pyramidal neurons to fire in bursts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Larkum1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Larkum2">[53]</xref>. Could LTPi of perisomatic inhibition regulate the processing of feed-forward sensory information thought to arrive more proximally in the dendrites?</p>
<p>Whereas the persistent strengthening of glutamatergic synapses has been proposed to have a key role in development and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Whitlock1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Malenka1">[55]</xref>, the role of plasticity of GABAergic synapses is currently largely unknown. LTPi can powerfully modulate the impact of synaptic inputs targeting specific pyramidal neuron compartments. Importantly, perisomatic inhibition is fundamental for network synchronization during cortical oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Freund1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Buzsaki1">[56]</xref>. Therefore, a persistent increase of perisomatic inhibition, with unaltered excitation, will have profound effects on the computational properties of cortical principal neurons. Indeed, precision of cortical neuron firing and their ability to act as coincident detectors is governed by how excitatory inputs are curtailed by inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Gabernet1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Berger1">[57]</xref>. Here we show that selective strengthening of perisomatic GABAergic synapses narrowed the time window for integration of temporally dispersed excitatory inputs. Consequently, in response to LTPi, layer 5 pyramidal neurons tend to fire significantly less, but with a much improved temporal precision. Thus, it will be interesting to test whether selective potentiation of perisomatic inhibition onto single pyramidal neurons changes their specific temporal association to global cortical network activity, likely affecting the relay of information to other cortical and subcortical areas.</p>
<p>In addition, the perisomatic specificity of LTPi is of great importance if one considers that in layer 5 pyramidal neurons somatic activity increases the distal dendritic computation of incoming information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Larkum1">[52]</xref>. Hence, selective plasticity of perisomatic inhibition could alter the way sensory information is perceived in distal dendrites, in addition to its role shown here to modulate pyramidal neuron spike output.</p>

Synaptic currents were recorded in whole-cell voltage- or current-clamp mode of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mouse primary barrel somatosensory cortex visually identified using infrared video microscopy by their large somata and pia-oriented apical dendrites.

<p>LTPi of GABAergic synapses onto layer V neurons is majorly expressed presynaptically. (A) Normalized changes of eIPSCs (ΔeIPSCs, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) in response to postsynaptic depolarizations. Grey symbols and white symbols refer to pyramidal neurons that did and did not express LTPi, respectively. (B, Left) Analysis of the squared coefficients of variations of evoked IPSCs (CV<sup>2</sup>1/CV<sup>2</sup>2) as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001903-Faber1">[59]</xref>. Numbers 1 and 2 refer to baseline and after depolarization values, respectively. According to this analysis, CV<sup>2</sup> values on the horizontal line (I) reflect a postsynaptic potentiation, whereas cells in region II (above the diagonal linear fit line) showed a presynaptic LTPi expression. Values in region III refer to P neurons with a mixed pre- and postsynaptic LTPi expression. Overall, apart from a few exceptions, layer 5 P neurons showed a presynaptic locus of LTPi expression. (B, Right) LTPi was accompanied by a reduction in CV (grey bar), whereas cells that were not depolarized had no change in CV (white bar). (C) LTPi was accompanied with a decrease in PPR (grey bars), whereas cells that were not depolarized had a constant PPR overtime. (D, Left) mIPSCs rise-time distribution. No change of rise-time distribution was observed after LTPi-inducing stimuli (red distribution). (D, Right) mIPSC rise times during baseline (white bar and symbols) and after steps (grey bar and black symbols). Note the very fast rise times (&lt;1 ms), indicating that inhibitory quantal events were mostly perisomatic. No change was observed after LTPi induction. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.</p>

<p>LTPi alters the E/I ratio onto layer 5 P neurons. (A) Representative current-clamp traces of EPSP-IPSC sequence recorded in low physiological intracellular chloride. Two examples are shown illustrating how the selective potentiation of the GABAergic, hyperpolarizing component of the composite PSP curtailed the glutamatergic, depolarizing part (example 1). This led, in some cases, to the complete disappearance of the EPSP (example 2). (B) Population analysis of the depolarizing component of the composite PSP before and 15 min after AP burst firing. (C) Schematic of the recording and stimulating configuration. (D) Representative voltage-clamp traces of EPSC evoked by stimulations of the same distal (dEPSC, Top) or proximal (pEPSC, Bottom) pathway at brief (20 ms) intervals. Note the presence of paired-pulse facilitation in both cases. (E) When the two pathways were activated at the same interval but independently, no short-term plasticity was present, indicating that the two stimulating electrodes could activate distinct glutamatergic pathways.
