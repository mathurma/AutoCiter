        <p>Gene expression actualizes the organismal phenotypes encoded within the genome in an environment-dependent manner. Among all encoded phenotypes, cell population growth rate (fitness) is perhaps the most important, since it determines how well-adapted a genotype is in various environments. Traditional biological measurement techniques have revealed the connection between the environment and fitness based on the gene expression mean. Yet, recently it became clear that cells with identical genomes exposed to the same environment can differ dramatically from the population average in their gene expression and division rate (individual fitness). For cell populations with bimodal gene expression, this difference is particularly pronounced, and may involve stochastic transitions between two cellular states that form distinct sub-populations. Currently it remains unclear how a cell population's growth rate and its subpopulation fractions emerge from the molecular-level kinetics of gene networks and the division rates of single cells. To address this question we developed and quantitatively characterized an inducible, bistable synthetic gene circuit controlling the expression of a bifunctional antibiotic resistance gene in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Following fitness and fluorescence measurements in two distinct environments (inducer alone and antibiotic alone), we applied a computational approach to predict cell population fitness and subpopulation fractions in the combination of these environments based on stochastic cellular movement in gene expression space and fitness space. We found that knowing the fitness and nongenetic (cellular) memory associated with specific gene expression states were necessary for predicting the overall fitness of cell populations in combined environments. We validated these predictions experimentally and identified environmental conditions that defined a “sweet spot” of drug resistance. These findings may provide a roadmap for connecting the molecular-level kinetics of gene networks to cell population fitness in well-defined environments, and may have important implications for phenotypic variability of drug resistance in natural settings.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>It is common belief that the properties of cells depend on their environment and on the genes they carry. Yet, many cases exist where individual cells in the same environment behave very differently, despite sharing the same genes. This creates a problem when we try to explain the behavior of a cell population based on the genes these cells carry. For example, it is difficult to predict how fast the overall number of cells increases based on the genes they all carry if some cells divide much faster than others. We addressed this problem using a synthetic gene circuit that could randomly allocate cells into drug resistant and drug sensitive states. We could control the fractions of cells and the time they resided in these states by adding an inducer to the growth solution. After measuring how fast cells transitioned between these two states, and how fast they grew in inducer and drug alone, we predicted computationally how fast they should grow when both inducer and drug are present. We validated experimentally these predictions and found a “sweet spot” of drug resistance where cells grew fastest in the presence of drugs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene expression is the biological process that converts the cell's genotype into phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) in an environment-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Jacob1">[1]</xref>. From an evolutionary standpoint, <italic>fitness</italic> (cell population growth rate) may be the most important phenotype encoded, since it defines the competitive ability of a genotype in specific environments. The critical role of gene expression as a determinant of fitness in various environments was confirmed by a variety of gene expression measurement techniques, including beta-galactosidase assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Dekel1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Perfeito1">[4]</xref> and microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Ferea1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Vilaprinyo1">[7]</xref>. Such techniques typically rely on pooling millions of cells, and therefore can only measure the average gene expression of a given sample. Consequently, many studies in the past have tacitly used the population <italic>average</italic> of gene expression as a proxy for “gene expression”. However this may be problematic due to the lack of information of how the gene expression of individual cells differs from the population average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Levsky1">[8]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Gene expression (middle panel) is a complex process that bridges the genotype (left panel) and fitness (right panel). Stochastic gene expression at any instant of time can be described by a distribution (gray bars). The distribution can be further characterized by its mean (red arrow; the arithmetic average taken over all cells), standard deviation (blue arrows; quantifies deviations from the mean), and possibly other moment-related metrics. Moreover, gene expression also has temporal aspects, which can be characterized by nongenetic (cellular) memory (horizontal black arrows; the average time for which cells maintain a specific expression state in a constant environment). Ten time course simulations of stochastic gene expression in bistable cell lineages are shown as illustration (gray traces).</p>

      <p>Accumulating evidence indicates that cells with identical genomes exposed to the same environment can differ dramatically in their gene expression and phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Novick1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Cohen1">[13]</xref>. Protein levels can vary from cell to cell due to pre-existing differences in cellular characteristics and microenvironments, or simply due to the stochastic nature of intracellular biochemical events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Blake1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Zenklusen1">[19]</xref>. The ubiquity of non-genetic heterogeneity in clonal cell populations implies that gene expression is a complex stochastic process incompletely described by the mean alone. Rather, gene expression in a cell population is more accurately represented by a distribution, and requires further statistical descriptors (such as the standard deviation, variance, or coefficient of variation) to quantify the amplitude of deviations from the population mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Recent experiments showed that cell populations with identical gene expression means, but different gene expression variances survive differently in stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Bayer1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Smith1">[22]</xref>. Yet, an important aspect that received less attention is that gene expression variation (noise) can also correspond to variable cell division rates. Consequently, the average <italic>fitness</italic> (cell population growth rate) may not reflect the division rates of individual cells. It is not entirely clear how to link the molecular-level kinetics of gene networks to the variable division rates of single cells and to cell population growth rate in specific environments.</p>
      <p>Deviations of gene expression from the population average are particularly evident when gene expression is bimodal and cells belong to distinct “ON” and “OFF” subpopulations of drastically different protein content. Importantly, cells may switch randomly between such gene expression states, only transiently residing in a given subpopulation. This average time for which an individual cell remains in a given gene expression state defines <italic>cellular memory</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Bistability and stochastic switching have received substantial attention over the last decade due to growing evidence for their involvement in cellular decision-making and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Veening1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Balzsi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Paliwal1">[27]</xref>. This motivated recent efforts in synthetic biology to design positive feedback gene circuits that function as “cellular memory modules”, maintaining a target gene over multiple cell divisions in one of two or more distinct expression states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-AjoFranklin1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Isaacs1">[33]</xref>. However, tuning cellular memory appears inherently coupled to changes in subpopulation balance: gene expression states become more populated as their stability increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Could it be possible for an unpopulated gene expression state to be nevertheless much more stable than a highly populated state?</p>

      <p>Besides the possible practical applications of synthetic memory modules, they can also be used to address fundamental questions on bet hedging, a frequently revisited topic in economics, ecology and evolutionary biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Stearns1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-deJong1">[36]</xref>. The essence of bet-hedging is to preemptively assign parts of a population to diverse survival abilities in expectance of unpredictable external changes. Individual cells may stochastically transition in and out of these protected and usually costly phenotypic states. For example, specific switching rates between a stress-resistance gene's “ON” and “OFF” expression states can optimize population survival in recurrent stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Thattai1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref>. Moreover, high variance in the duration of competence episodes optimizes DNA uptake in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, suggesting that the <italic>variability</italic> of temporal gene expression characteristics can have functional relevance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-aatay1">[41]</xref>. Yet, most studies so far have assumed that phenotype switching rates can change without an internal fitness cost, and focused on a constant, single fitness level associated with each phenotypic variant in each environment. What happens if altering the time scales of phenotypic fluctuations involves a fitness cost? And how do such convoluted changes of fitness and memory affect optimal switching rates and the tolerance to increasing levels of sustained stress? These important questions remain to be examined experimentally.</p>
      <p>To address these questions <italic>using a specific synthetic system</italic>, we developed and quantitatively characterized a chromosomally integrated, inducible synthetic gene circuit that enforced bimodal distribution of a bifunctional protein (yEGFP::ZeoR) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nevozhay1">[42]</xref>. This bifunctional protein served as a fluorescent reporter while also protecting yeast cells from the antibiotic Zeocin, enabling us to directly relate gene expression variability to the corresponding fitness variations.</p>
      <p>Proper understanding of the environment-fitness connection would imply that we can predict the phenotype (fitness) given the genotype and the environment. Therefore, we first characterized cell population fitness in two specific sets of environmental conditions (i.e., antibiotic alone and inducer alone), and aimed to make experimentally testable fitness predictions in new environments defined as combinations of the same inducer and antibiotic. We found that the nongenetic (cellular) memory of <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression <italic>and</italic> individual cell division rates at specific gene expression states were necessary to predict overall cell population fitness with a high degree of precision. Based on these considerations, we identified a specific inducer-antibiotic combination that defined a “sweet spot” where cells maximized their drug resistance due to cellular memory. This “sweet spot” appears for different reasons than the optimum predicted by recent bet-hedging models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Thattai1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref>, and does not co-locate with it. The reason for this disagreement is the fitness cost associated with increasing the memory of the drug resistant state in our system. This effect was not considered in recent bet hedging models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Thattai1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref>, but is likely wide-spread in nature, due to the metabolic cost or toxicity of various survival mechanisms, including drug resistance protein expression.</p>

        <title>A synthetic gene circuit confers bistable expression to a drug resistance gene</title>
        <p>We constructed a chromosomally integrated synthetic gene circuit in yeast, which controlled the expression of a bifunctional fluorescent reporter and antibiotic resistance gene, <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nevozhay1">[42]</xref>. This “positive feedback” (PF) gene circuit consisted of a modified version (rtTA-MF) of the rtTA activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Urlinger1">[43]</xref> that, upon binding to the inducer ATc, activated its own expression as well as the expression of <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> from synthetic P<sub>TETREG</sub> promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Becskei1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The degree of rtTA activation was adjusted through varying the concentration of the inducer anhydrotetracycline (ATc) in the growth medium, which diffuses through the cell membrane, associates with rtTA and promotes its binding to <italic>tetO2</italic> sites near the TATA box of the target promoter.</p>
        <p>We used flow cytometry to collect steady-state gene expression measurements at increasing inducer (ATc) concentrations from an isogenic yeast cell population carrying the PF gene circuit. We repeatedly resuspended the cells into identical medium every 12 hours until the gene expression histograms stabilized. We established dose-response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref>) based on these steady-state measurements, by calculating the <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> reporter expression mean and CV (coefficient of variation = standard deviation divided by the mean; see the Materials &amp; Methods).</p>
        <p>As observed previously for similar constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Becskei1">[29]</xref>, yeast cell populations carrying the PF gene circuit (called “PF cells” hereafter) had unimodal gene expression at very low induction, and bimodal expression above a low but nonzero ATc threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2B, D, E</xref> and Section 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>). The proportion of cells in the high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression state increased with the inducer concentration at the expense of cells with low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression. We quantified this by the subpopulation ratio <italic>R</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), defined as the number of cells with high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression divided by the number of cells with low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression. The pronounced gene expression bimodality indicated that isogenic PF cells in the same environment separate into high- and low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expressors, causing the rise in CV at intermediate ATc concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2C, E</xref>). This is due to the bistability that arises from combining a nonlinear promoter response with explicit or implicit, growth rate-mediated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Klumpp1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Tan1">[45]</xref> positive feedback regulation. Based on our earlier insights on related gene expression constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nevozhay1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Murphy1">[46]</xref> involving the repressor from which rtTA was derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Urlinger1">[43]</xref>, we developed a mathematical model that agreed with earlier models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Becskei1">[29]</xref> and the current observation that the PF construct became bistable once the inducer concentration exceeded a threshold value (≈1 ng/ml). These theoretical results (see Section 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>) were consistent with the sharply distinct peaks of <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression observed experimentally beyond this threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2B, E</xref>).</p>
        <p>In biological terms, the bistability of the PF gene circuit implies that PF cells can undergo random phenotypic switching between high and low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression states due to noisy intracellular dynamics. This situation can be depicted as random movement in some potential, which is analogous to Waddington's landscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Waddington1">[47]</xref>. Cells will repeatedly dedifferentiate and redifferentiate into these distinct gene expression states as they are forced to explore the landscape under the influence of gene expression noise. Importantly, since the <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> gene product confers resistance to Zeocin, the cells also assume two distinct phenotypes: they can be drug sensitive, low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expressors or drug-resistant, high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expressors. This leads to the question: how can we utilize this information on the <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression pattern, and what else is needed to predict cell population growth rate in well-defined sets of environments defined by various inducer and antibiotic concentrations? The rest of this paper seeks to answer this question.</p>

        <title>Two different types of fitness</title>
        <p>Fitness is a central and often controversial concept in evolutionary theory that quantifies the contribution of a given genotype to the next generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nowak1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Orr1">[50]</xref>. For historical and practical reasons, there are many different definitions of fitness. For example, models and experiments focusing on competition between genotypes have measured fitness relative to a specific genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Orr1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Lenski1">[51]</xref>. Alternatively, absolute fitness can be defined as the <italic>per capita</italic> rate of increase in absolute population size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nowak1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Orr1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Fong1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nur1">[53]</xref>, which is relevant in non-competitive scenarios. In the remainder of this paper we will adhere to the latter definition, considering a single haploid genotype (PF) that we carefully maintain in exponential growth phase while exposing it to various well-defined environments.</p>
        <p>The above gene expression measurements imply an important distinction between two types of fitness that we define below with regard to nongenetic (phenotypic) variation. At intermediate inducer concentrations, two different cell types coexist that constantly convert into each other and potentially divide at different rates. Therefore, individual cell division rates may be very different from the overall rate of cell population increase. For example, in the presence of Zeocin, high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic>-expressing cells will divide much faster than their low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic>-expressing peers. To account for this effect, we define <italic>instantaneous or transient cellular fitness</italic> as the typical rate of division for single cells of a given fluorescence, at specific inducer and antibiotic concentrations. On the other hand, any change in cell population size over time results from individual cells dividing while they randomly switch between various gene expression states. The rate of clonal cell population growth will therefore be described by the <italic>overall cell population fitness</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nur1">[53]</xref>. These notions correspond to the individual and absolute fitness, respectively, as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Orr1">[50]</xref>, except that we emphasize random fitness changes both from cell to cell and over time. The precise relationship between the two types of fitness will be established below. Our goal will be to understand how the genotype and the environment jointly determine the overall cell population fitness.</p>

        <title>Defining the environmental fitness landscape of uninduced PF cells at various levels of Zeocin</title>
        <p>Understanding the environment-fitness connection for drug resistance implies that we can predict the overall cell population fitness given the genotype and the environment. Therefore, we set out to predict computationally the fitness of PF cell populations in arbitrary inducer and drug concentrations based on two pieces of information: (i) the fitness of uninduced cells (drug-sensitive state, ATc = 0) in various Zeocin concentrations; and (ii) the probability of cells residing in Zeocin-resistant and Zeocin-sensitive states at various inducer concentrations, in the absence of drug (Zeocin = 0). Since we already knew the latter from the dose-response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), we measured experimentally the fitness <italic>g<sub>E</sub></italic> of uninduced (ATc = 0) PF cell populations at various Zeocin concentrations over several days, using the formula<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002480.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>N</italic> is the number of cells and Δ<italic>t</italic> is the time between two subsequent cell count measurements.

        <p>Using simple biochemical considerations (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we defined the instantaneous fitness of uninduced PF cells semi-phenomenologically by the marginal fitness reduction <italic>γ</italic><sub>1</sub> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

        <title>Defining the environmental fitness landscape of PF cells in the absence of antibiotic</title>
        <p>Since our goal was to predict overall cell population fitness at arbitrary inducer (ATc) and antibiotic (Zeocin) combinations, we had to test whether varying the inducer concentration had any fitness impact itself. Therefore, we followed the approach described above to experimentally measure the overall PF cell population fitness at various ATc concentrations, in the absence of antibiotic. We observed a decline in fitness as the fraction of high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expressors became larger at increasing ATc concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This decline in fitness may be attributed to a combination of costs related to transcription, translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Kudla1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Scott1">[57]</xref> and rtTA toxicity or “squelching” described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Baron1">[58]</xref>. The rtTA-specific squelching toxicity arises from the VP16 activation domain of the activator, which may form non-specific transcriptional complexes with general transcription factors, sequestering them from vital cellular processes. Since all of the above processes harm cell fitness, there is an overall cost associated with processes related to active (ATc-bound) rtTA. We characterized the typical rate of division for cells of a given fluorescence at a specific inducer concentration by a semi-phenomenological marginal fitness reduction <italic>γ</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Figs. 3B, D</xref>) as we did for Zeocin alone.

        <p>In summary, ATc-bound activator toxicity implies that defense from Zeocin is costly. The more populated the protected, high yEGFP::zeoR expressing state, the higher the active rtTA expression, and the slower the division rate of individual cells and of the entire cell population.</p>

        <title>Fitness landscape predictions assuming low memory are not confirmed experimentally</title>
        <p>To predict cell population fitness in various combinations of the inducer and the antibiotic, we assumed that the joint effects of these molecules followed Bliss independence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Yeh1">[59]</xref>. This implied that the combined action of these two molecules could be calculated by multiplying their individual effects. This assumption was reasonable, considering the different mechanisms involved in the toxicities of Zeocin and active rtTA. Thus, we calculated the instantaneous fitness reduction <italic>γ</italic>(<italic>F</italic>,<italic>C,Z</italic>) at arbitrary levels of ATc and Zeocin by simply multiplying the previously defined marginal fitness components <italic>γ</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>F</italic>,<italic>Z</italic>) and <italic>γ</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>F</italic>,<italic>C</italic>):<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002480.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>Relaxing the assumption of Bliss independence, and introducing various forms of dependence between Zeocin and ATc-bound activator toxicity did not affect our conclusions (see Section 5 and Fig. S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>First, we calculated the overall cell population fitness <italic>g<sub>T</sub></italic> assuming cellular memory was much lower than typical cell division times. Thus, we obtained <italic>g<sub>T</sub></italic> by averaging the instantaneous fitness reduction, <italic>γ</italic> = <italic>γ</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>γ</italic><sub>2</sub>, weighting by the fluorescence distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>F</italic>) measured in the absence of Zeocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>) as in equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Dekel1">[2]</xref> above. This calculation assumes very fast transitions across the gene expression distribution such that the probability distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>F</italic>) remains unchanged after the onset of selection (Zeocin treatment). Based on these assumptions, we predicted the overall cell population fitness <italic>g<sub>T</sub></italic> for PF cells at different levels of induction (ATc ranging from 0 to 20 ng/ml) with Zeocin concentration set to 2 mg/ml. The predictions showed a mild, gradual rise in fitness as ATc increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To experimentally test these predictions, we induced PF cells over the range of 0 to 20 ng/ml ATc. After the <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> distributions became stable (did not change from day to day), we exposed these populations to 2 mg/ml Zeocin, and measured the cell density every 12 hours over several days as described above. Fitness was then estimated over the last 6 time points to minimize the transient effects immediately after exposure to Zeocin (see the Materials &amp; Methods and Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>). We used the R<sup>2</sup> metric to determine how much of the PF cell population fitness was explained by the computational model. The percentage of the data explained by the fitness landscape was very low, with an R<sup>2</sup> measured at &lt;0.001, consistent with the disagreement between the predicted and measured overall cell population fitness at low inducer concentrations (ATc&lt;10 ng/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

        <title>Estimates of cellular memory based on cellular current</title>
        <p>Seeking to reconcile the predicted and measured cell population fitness values, we asked whether the fast inter-conversion between various fitness levels used in those calculations was realistic. If not, then slow cellular phenotype switching (cellular memory) may enable individual cells to reside for prolonged times in advantageous regions of the fitness landscape, thus improving overall population fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Charlebois1">[60]</xref>. Such an effect was suggested theoretically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Thattai1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Kussell1">[39]</xref> and demonstrated experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref> in fluctuating environments, but not in sustained stress.</p>
        <p>We developed a novel computational method related to cell population balance modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Stamatakis1">[61]</xref> to determine the cellular memory based on a stationary distribution of expression for proteins with long half life, such as yEGFP::ZeoR (see the Section 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>). To do this, we defined the <italic>directional cellular current</italic> as the number of cells crossing a specific fluorescence threshold in a given direction (up or down) per unit time. We designated cells into two phenotypes, the (<italic>L</italic>)ow and (<italic>H</italic>)igh <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression states, separated by an arbitrary yEGFP::ZeoR concentration threshold, <italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The <italic>H</italic> and <italic>L</italic> states do not need to imply bistability and are quite general: they simply indicate that cells express <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> below or above a threshold. Importantly, the yEGFP::ZeoR protein is highly stable (data not shown) and is mainly lost through dilution of cellular contents by cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Alon1">[62]</xref>. Therefore, the downward current <italic>I<sub>H→L</sub></italic> of cells escaping from the <italic>H</italic> to <italic>L</italic> state across the threshold mainly depends on the rate at which cell growth dilutes out the protein yEGFP::ZeoR.

            <p>(A) Cellular currents characterize the constant upward and downward movement of cells within stationary distributions under the influence of noise. Cells were first partitioned into 2 gene expression states, of (<italic>L</italic>)ow and (<italic>H</italic>)igh <italic>yEGFP:zeoR</italic> expression, depending on how their fluorescence compared to a preset threshold <italic>θ</italic>. The upward cellular current (<italic>I<sub>L→H</sub></italic>) was defined as the fraction of cells leaving the <italic>L</italic> gene expression state per unit time, while the downward cellular current <italic>I<sub>H→L</sub></italic> described movement in the opposite direction. For stationary distributions where fitness is unaffected by particular expression state, the upward and downward cellular currents must cancel each other. On the other hand, unequal high and low expressor fitness values (<italic>g<sub>L</sub></italic>≠<italic>g<sub>H</sub></italic>) imply unequal cellular currents (<italic>I<sub>L</sub></italic>≠<italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>), even in stationary distributions. (B) Cellular memories estimated from the gene expression distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2E</xref> using the cellular current model, incorporating instantaneous cellular fitness differences.

The “rising” and “falling” rates were estimated from both low-sorted and high-sorted cell populations, revealing a higher gene expression memory for PF high expressors as compared to low expressors.</p>

        <p>Next, we calculated how long it would take on average for an arbitrary cell with high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression to cross the threshold downward. If the total number of cells in the (<italic>H</italic>)igh state is <italic>N<sub>H</sub></italic>, the average waiting time <italic>τ<sub>H</sub></italic> spent in the state <italic>H</italic> is given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Eberling1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Risken1">[64]</xref><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002480.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>This is equivalent to asking: how long would it take for an arbitrary cell to leave the <italic>H</italic> state, if cells exit at rate <italic>I<sub>H→L</sub></italic>? The time spent in state <italic>H</italic> is therefore the cellular memory of the high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression state. These calculations provide a simple way to estimate the memory of any gene expression state defined by an arbitrary threshold within any stationary distribution. We also applied other approaches, including escape rate theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Bialek1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Kepler1">[66]</xref> to estimate cellular memory and obtained consistent, but less accurate results (see Section 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>). Our semi-phenomenological approach based on cellular current may be more attractive because, unlike escape rate theory, it does not require an underlying mathematical model and a set of parameters.</p>
        <p>Normally, in the absence of instantaneous fitness differences, when stationary distributions do not change in time, the downward and upward cellular currents across any threshold must be in balance, and as a result the net current is 0: <italic>I<sub>L→H</sub></italic> = <italic>I<sub>H→L</sub></italic>. However, when instantaneous fitness changes with the gene expression level, the cellular currents must compensate for these fitness differences (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As a result, cells of higher individual fitness will constantly migrate towards regions of lower fitness in the gene expression space. This creates a nonzero net cellular current that moves cells upward throughout the gene expression distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>. The “power sources” for this current are fitness differences across these distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
        <p>We estimated cellular memories at various ATc concentrations by applying the above formula to the experimental yEGFP::ZeoR expression distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and cell population fitness values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We found that soon after the ATc concentration crossed the bistability threshold and some PF cells started to differentiate into a drug-tolerant high expressor subpopulation, these cells gained increasingly higher memory, while the memory of low expressors showed a monotone decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The decreasing and increasing trends in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> indicate that ATc can be used to tune the memory of the high and low expression states (or equivalently, the rates of stochastic transitions between these expression states). These trends mirror the inducer-dependent changes in subpopulation fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating that changes in memory and subpopulation fractions are coupled in the absence of Zeocin, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. In particular, at 10 ng/ml ATc, the memory of high yEGFP::ZeoR was &gt;283 hours, an order of magnitude higher than the memory of low expressing cells (∼16 hours), as indicated by the vertical dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>. Importantly, we had to smooth the experimental fluorescence distributions to deal with empty bins (instances of <italic>N</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) = 0). As a result, the memory <italic>τ<sub>H</sub></italic> obtained for high expressors should be considered a conservative lower estimate.</p>

        <title>Experimental confirmation of cellular memory estimates in PF cells</title>
        <p>Based on the cellular current, we predicted that the memories of high and low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression at [ATc] = 10 ng/ml should be greater than 283 hours and 16 hours, respectively, with more than an order of magnitude difference between the two. To validate these memory predictions, we measured experimentally the nongenetic memory of high and low gene expression states conferred by the PF gene circuit at [ATc] = 10 ng/ml. We selected this intermediate inducer concentration because it gave approximately balanced high and low expressor subpopulations, which facilitated fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). After preinducing the PF cell population with [ATc] = 10 ng/ml, and allowing the fluorescence distribution to stabilize over 3 days, we sorted the high and low expressors apart. Subsequently, we resuspended each of these sorted subpopulations, as well as the unsorted control cells every 12 hours into the same medium as before sorting to determine how fast the yEGFP::ZeoR distributions relaxed to their original stationary distribution via stochastic switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To quantify the stochastic switching rates between high and low reporter gene expression from this data, we estimated the switching rates of the following two-state population dynamics model that results directly from the cellular current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) and has been applied successfully by others to estimate cellular memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Thattai1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002480.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>Here, the variables <italic>N<sub>L</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>H</sub></italic> corresponded to the number of cells in the low (<italic>L</italic>) state that could either “rise” into the high (<italic>H</italic>) state at the rate <italic>r</italic> = <italic>I<sub>L</sub></italic>/<italic>N<sub>L</sub></italic>, or divide at the rate <italic>g<sub>L</sub></italic>, and to the number of cells in the <italic>H</italic> state that could either “fall” into the <italic>L</italic> state at the rate <italic>f</italic> = <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>/<italic>N<sub>H</sub></italic>, or divide at the rate <italic>g<sub>H</sub></italic>, respectively. From these equations, we obtained the analytical solution for the subpopulation ratio of low expressors to high expressors over time, <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>N<sub>L</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>N<sub>H</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic>), as a function of <italic>r</italic> and <italic>f</italic> (see the Materials &amp; Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Fitting <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) to the experimentally measured subpopulation ratios from both sorted and unsorted populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>), we obtained switching rates of <italic>r</italic>≈28.5±6.6×10<sup>−3</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>; <italic>f</italic> = 0.7±0.4×10<sup>−3</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> for PF cells grown at 10 ng/ml ATc. The obtained PF switching rates correspond to cellular memories of high and low <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression of 990 hours and 24 hours, respectively. These values differed by more than an order of magnitude, and compared well with the memory estimates based on the cellular current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We made similar predictions and measurements for a few other synthetic gene circuits, confirming the utility of our approach based on cellular current to predict cellular memory (see Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>These results indicate that instead of being controlled by comparable rising and falling rates, balanced populations of PF low and high expressors result from low expressor cells preferentially transitioning to high expression, whose lower fitness due to rtTA toxicity prevents them from dominating the population (horizontal arrows on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Importantly, these effects are completely different from recently noted cases of implicit, growth rate-mediated positive feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Klumpp1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Tan1">[45]</xref>. Rather, a similar case has been described in prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Novick1">[9]</xref>, where different fitnesses compensate for unequal switching rates, re-establishing the subpopulation balance between high and low expressors. Inspired by this classical work on the Lac operon, we further confirmed the strong, but finite non-genetic memory of PF high expressors by purifying single high expressor cells by serial dilution and observing them over several days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Novick1">[9]</xref> (see Section 8.2 and Fig. S10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>).

        <p>The switching rates from the cellular current model predicted that the memory of high expressors would remain well above the cell division rates even when cells were minimally induced. This minimal level of ATc should have minimal cost of rtTA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g003">Figs. 3A and 3C</xref>), but could still drive high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression in a small fraction of the cells to completely protect them from Zeocin. Importantly, these few “sentinel”, persister-like cells have time to expand into a large population over several days due to the long memory of the protective high <italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic> expression state at all ATc concentrations, which is necessary to observe this effect.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of nongenetic memory into the model dramatically improved the agreement between computational predictions and experimentally measured fitness of PF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g005">Fig. 5D, E</xref>). Specifically, we found that with no additional information, our model was able to explain 98% of fitness differences simply by incorporating memory (compared to &lt;0.1% without memory). Thus, consistent with the computational predictions, the experiments confirmed that bimodal distributions with fewest high expressors had the greatest relative fitness at ∼1 ng/ml ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), which is where bimodal gene expression first appears. This level of induction defines a “sweet spot”, where the small high expressor subpopulation can reside and expand optimally. Here cells experience sufficient protection from Zeocin at a minimal cost of ATc-bound rtTA, while the strong non-genetic memory of this “protected” gene expression state prevents switching to low expression where cells become vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the location of this fitness optimum disagrees with predictions of recent bet-hedging models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Thattai1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref>, which imply that optimal phenotype switching rates should match the rates of environmental fluctuations. Measuring the fitness of PF cells over several days in Zeocin corresponds to very long periods of stress in bet-hedging models (“very long” in terms of cell division times). Thus, according to the previous studies, extended memory of the protective high expressor state should improve survival in long stressful periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, these earlier conclusions were drawn assuming that nongenetic switching rates could be altered without any fitness cost, and disagree with our observation of a sweet spot at the minimal memory of the high expression state (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> as well as Section 9 and Fig. S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) The cellular memory and fitness of the cellular states interacted in multiple ways that ultimately defined the overall cell population fitness and the distribution of gene expression. Contrary to the naïve expectations illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, we observed that (i) the fractions of cells in the ON and OFF states did not reflect the switching rates between these states; and (ii) forcing most cells into the protected ON state did not provide optimal fitness during drug treatment. (B) Simulated cell population fitness as a function of ATc when the environment switches either randomly or periodically between 0 mg/ml Zeocin (normal) and 2 mg/ml Zeocin (toxic), with the average duration of the normal and toxic environments indicated in the figure. The red circles indicate the ATc concentration (ATc = 100 ng/ml) necessary for setting the phenotypic switching rates to confer optimal fitness based on the Kussell-Leibler theory. (C) Illustration of how cell linage statistics (purple outline) can be different from population snapshot statistics (orange outline). Cells tend to switch predominantly to the high expression state and rarely switch back. Consequently, individual cell lineages over time tend to spend most of their time in the high expression state. However, cellular fitness in the high expression state is lower. As a result, population snapshot measurements will observe more low expressor cells due to the higher cellular fitness of the low-expressing state.</p>

        <p>Confirming the crucial role of the minute high expressor subpopulation in conferring protection from Zeocin, the steady state distribution was completely reshaped after selection of nongenetic variants in antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). From almost 100% low expressors in the absence of Zeocin, the distribution changed to nearly 100% high expressors, corresponding to a dramatic ∼45 fold increase in the fraction of high expressing cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>. This implies that subpopulation fractions and cellular memory can be uncoupled for cells carrying gene circuits similar to the one described here, with nongenetic memories longer than their division times. Indeed, the same cellular memory corresponds to very different subpopulation fractions in the absence and presence of drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>
        <p>We performed parameter scans to determine how various properties inherent to our system and assumptions in our model affect the sharp peak that defines the “sweet spot”. We found that the sharp peak was robust to the inclusion of various interactions between rtTA and Zeocin toxicities (i.e., relaxing the Bliss independence), and remained consistent as long as the cellular memories were less than the overall cell population growth rates. Fitness surfaces generated from other toxicity models based on Loewe additivity, Loewe antagonism, and Loewe synergy all showed a characteristic sweet spot (see Section 5 and Fig. S6, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>). However, as the switching rates became comparable to cell division rates, the sharp fitness peak was reduced and became gradually flatter.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our goal in this paper was to map the environmental fitness landscape, and to identify aspects of stochastic gene expression that are necessary for establishing the environment-fitness connection. This required developing a simple modeling framework to account for the mutual dependency of cell growth and gene expression, so that the behaviors of cells with multiple phenotypes could be better understood and controlled. To allow for predictive quantitative modeling and properly test the modeling predictions, it was necessary to minimize the biological complexity inherent in natural gene networks. Thus, we chose to focus on cell populations carrying an inducible synthetic gene circuit, in the spirit of the booming field of synthetic biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Lu1">[68]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Dymond1">[72]</xref>. The synthetic gene circuit controlled a bifunctional antibiotic resistance protein, which provided protection from Zeocin, and could also be visualized in single cells due to its fluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nevozhay1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>After determining fitness and subpopulation fractions in two sets of well-defined environments, we used this information to predict fitness and subpopulation fractions in a combination of these environments. This is non-trivial when phenotypic variation is present, because the cell population's average fitness is an aggregate of individual cell fitness values that are transient due to phenotype switching. Thus, to map the environmental fitness landscape, we defined two different types of fitness (transient cellular fitness and overall cell population fitness), which relate to each other as the gene expression in individual cells relates to the population average of gene expression. A similar distinction has existed for genetically diverse populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nur1">[53]</xref>, - but here we defined these types of fitness for genetically homogenous populations of cells that carry the same noisy bistable synthetic gene circuit.</p>
      <p>Instantaneous fitness was affected by two different factors, namely the growth-inhibitory effect of Zeocin and rtTA-associated toxicity. We also used the inducer ATc to separately control cellular memory, defined as the average lifetime of a gene expression state (or the inverse of spontaneous switching rates) in a <italic>constant</italic> environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Balaban1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Cox1">[74]</xref>. We found that the instantaneous fitness and cellular memory jointly shape the overall gene expression distribution and determine overall cell population fitness in various environments in a non-trivial manner. Specifically, we argued that the synthetic gene network forces cells to explore an intracellular potential analogous to Waddington's landscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Waddington1">[47]</xref> under the influence of noise. While exploring the gene expression landscape, cells are also forced to move on a non-genetic version of Sewall Wright's fitness landscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Wright1">[75]</xref>, and face selection through the instantaneous fitness associated with their gene expression. Mapping the environmental fitness landscape requires integrating the movement on these two different landscapes, entirely defined by the cellular memories and instantaneous fitnesses associated with specific cellular states. The interplay between cellular memory and noisy cellular fitness results in distributions and fitness values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) that disagree with the naïve expectations illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. In summary, a true understanding of the environment-fitness connection can benefit from a Darwinian perspective applied to heritable nongenetic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Jablonka1">[76]</xref>. Mapping and computationally predicting the environment-dependent fitness landscape for this synthetic gene circuit might provide a potential roadmap to follow for other synthetic gene circuits and even for natural gene networks, to identify fitness-optimizing conditions relevant for microbial drug resistance, persistence, and virulence.</p>
      <p>We strove to develop mathematical models that were as simple as possible, but no simpler, when describing population level gene expression. In isolation, the original goals of these models were to describe mean gene expression levels, stochastic transitions between cell states, rtTA-associated toxicity, and cell growth. We also studied how pairwise interactions between these biological components shape population level fluorescence distributions. Finally, we synthesized these modeling approaches into comprehensive population-level stochastic simulations of gene expression. By modifying previous stochastic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nevozhay1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Murphy1">[46]</xref> to describe gene activation rather than repression and to account for the cost of inducer-bound activator, cell division, and non-genetic memory we were able to reproduce the overall experimental distributions of PF cells by computer simulations (see Fig. S12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>). In summary, non-genetic fitness differences between various gene expression states need to be carefully considered when studying instantaneous population-level gene expression measurements based on intracellular biochemical kinetics. Modeling approaches that do not incorporate fitness differences will lead to biased parameter estimates and misinterpretation of intracellular dynamics.</p>
      <p>For example, an important implication of our results is that temporal averages over individual cell lineages can be dramatically different from the population means due to slight changes in their individual fitnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Consider the bimodal population of PF cells with an approximately 1∶1 ratio of low and high expressors. Using live cell imaging under the microscope in a microfluidic chamber with controlled environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Bennett1">[67]</xref>, we have tracked individual cell lineages from this population (see Fig. S12C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s002">Video S1</xref>). Although cell populations were initially composed of 45% high expressors, over 30 hours the cell lineages spent 63% of the time in the high expression state. As the period of observation approaches the time of cellular memory, we expect that the cell lineages will converge to a percentage of∼97.5% in the high expression state. Thus, the population-average of gene expression measured at any time differs from the mean estimated by tracking individual cell lineages over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002480-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The same is probably true for other statistical measures of gene expression. This is important as some research groups have been obtaining single cell-level data from large cell populations at a given time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Newman1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Taniguchi1">[11]</xref>, while other groups have been collecting gene expression data by tracking single live cells over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Cox1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Rosenfeld1">[77]</xref>. Neither of these approaches is ideal, as both ignore information about division rates in expanding cell lineages. Our results indicate that gene expression statistics obtained from these different approaches will in general disagree, and may need to be reinterpreted in light of the fitness differences caused by gene expression.</p>
      <p>Our work differs from earlier studies aimed to determine stochastic switching rates that optimize fitness in fluctuating environments, some of which were exclusively theoretical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Thattai1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Kussell1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Pl1">[78]</xref>, while others included experiments, but did not map the fitness landscape at increasing levels of sustained stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Acar2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Balaban1">[73]</xref>. Seeking to predict optimal switching rates, these earlier studies assumed that switching rates could be altered without a fitness cost. By contrast, adjusting the memory in our system to favor of the high expression state involved an increasing fitness cost. Consequently, the switching rates that optimize fitness in our system differ from the prediction of earlier bet hedging studies, namely that maximal memory of the high expression state should optimize fitness for very long periods of drug exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Kussell1">[39]</xref>. In fact, we found the exact opposite. Minimal memory of the high expression state optimized fitness in our system, as long as a minuscule high expressor subpopulation existed to salvage the population after the onset of stress. This different optimum is caused by the cost associated with increasing the memory of the high expression state. While higher memory could salvage a larger fraction of the population immediately after stress onset, it would be unfavorable on the long run due to the increased rtTA toxicity (see Section 9 and Fig. S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002480.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Is there a similar fitness cost in natural systems for increasing the memory of a stress-tolerant state? The answer appears to be “yes”. First, bistability of stress-tolerance and stress resistance states are likely wide-spread in microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Veening2">[35]</xref>, due to implicit, growth rate-mediated positive feedbacks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Klumpp1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Tan1">[45]</xref> resulting from the expression cost or toxicity associated with various defense mechanisms. Examples include the toxin component of toxin-antitoxin systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-VanMelderen1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Rotem1">[80]</xref>, <italic>hipQ</italic> expression for type II persisters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Balaban1">[73]</xref>, or the TetA protein from the <italic>tetRA</italic> tetracycline resistance operon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Nguyen1">[81]</xref>. While defense and fitness cost are caused by the same protein in these natural systems, this is not unlike our synthetic gene network, in which the sources of cost (<italic>rtTA</italic>) and defense (<italic>yEGFP::zeoR</italic>) are expressed from identical promoters, and are therefore identically regulated, - almost as if these genes were fused or were part of an operon. Increasing memory in such implicit, growth-coupled positive feedback systems implies an elevated level of toxic protein, which causes slower growth and thereby a higher fitness cost. Therefore, toxicity, toxin expression level and memory of high toxin expression are practically synonymous in these systems. It will be highly important to study at the single cell level how toxin expression coupled with toxicity controls the emergence of bistability in many microbial toxin-antitoxin systems. This was exemplified by a recent pioneering study on the <italic>hipBA</italic> system in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Rotem1">[80]</xref>, where tuning the level of the HipA toxin resulted in the coexistence of normally growing and growth-arrested cells. The coexistence of such distinct phenotypes implies bistability somewhere in the network. While a growth rate-mediated positive feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Klumpp1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Tan1">[45]</xref> was not considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Rotem1">[80]</xref>, it would be important to investigate if its inclusion can cause bistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Ray1">[82]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The potential implications of the “sweet spot” observed in our experiments are intriguing, and may relate to the extremely low fraction of persister cells observed in microbial populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Balaban1">[73]</xref>. If increasing the memory of the drug-tolerant state is costly, it is advantageous to dedicate as small a fraction of the population as possible to the persister state. This minute persister population will then be able to reproduce during drug treatment at a minimal fitness cost. This is true as long as persisters have extensive memory and nonzero division rates like type II persisters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Balaban1">[73]</xref>, which may decrease or vanish as the fraction of persister cells and the memory of the persister state increases. Our experimental model and computational approach can therefore be useful in studying the properties of microbial populations with small fraction of resistant cells and bet hedging strategies.</p>
      <p>In addition, our findings have important implications for interpreting the outcome of biological measurement techniques focusing on the average gene expression in the population of cells (such as gel blot assays or microarrays). Specifically, apparent “upregulation” following stress exposure may be due to nongenetic selection of a particular pre-existing subpopulation, and may have nothing to do with actual gene regulation. For example, at the “sweet spot” Zeocin treatment caused a drastic apparent increase in average gene expression in the population that did not involve any increase in protein levels in individual cells, but was simply due to the increase of the proportion of high-expressing cells in the population. This effect was due to the selection of high expressors in the presence of Zeocin. A similar nongenetic selection mechanism may also be implicated in the emergence of microbial or cancer drug resistance, where rare pre-existing drug-tolerant cells could be selected during chemotherapy, causing additional resistance to subsequent rounds of treatment. Consistent with these studies, our results suggest that even without underlying genetic changes, gene expression variability can generate a stable, selectable subpopulation of rare survivor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Balaban1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Allison1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Sharma1">[84]</xref> that maintains resistance over hundreds of cell generations, and may serve as a reservoir of increasingly drug resistant mutants.</p>
      <p>The PF circuit design can be easily extended up to mammalian systems and down to bacterial systems, due to the simplicity of the circuit design and the availability of equivalent circuit components in other organisms. Growing evidence supports the feasibility of transferring synthetic gene circuits across organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Ellis1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Deans1">[85]</xref>, which might someday enable translational applications in the clinic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Chen1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Ruder1">[86]</xref>. For example, a potential application for synthetic gene circuits that consist of a self-activating regulator controlling a drug resistance gene may be engineering the microbiome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Ruder1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Duan1">[87]</xref>. All parts of the human body host immense microbial communities, with cell counts that exceed by an order of magnitude the number of our own cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Turnbaugh1">[88]</xref>. The microbiome can impact human physiology, and is required for vital functions of the human body. Consequently, rebalancing the microbiome may facilitate the reestablishment of homeostasis within the human body. Such rebalancing may be necessary after antibiotic treatment, which – in addition to the targeted pathogens – may drastically perturb the gut microbiome. For this reason, crucial members of the human microbiome could someday be engineered to survive or even proliferate during antibiotic treatment. Gene circuits similar to the one described above operating near the “sweet spot” may be capable of this task by ensuring near-optimal growth in both the absence and presence of antibiotic.</p>
      <p>Another potential use of gene circuits similar to the one described above might be for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of metastable states of stem cells or adult progenitor cells. It is known that these cell types can stochastically transition between various metastable states, some more prone to differentiation than others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Chambers1">[89]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Kalmar1">[92]</xref>. These stochastic transitions and their implications for differentiation may be difficult to study <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions may drastically perturb or abolish these metastable subpopulations. Gene circuits similar to PF controlling a metastable-state specific gene (in addition to a drug resistance gene) may reestablish the desired subpopulation fractions <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, applying selective pressure by introducing a drug into the medium could adjust the stability of these transient states independently of their subpopulation fractions. Such a system could someday provide a constant, desired yield of transient-amplifying or differentiated cells for further studies or perhaps regenerative medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002480-Ruder1">[86]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, this work highlights the importance of selective environments for characterizing the behavior of synthetic gene circuits, but also has implications for studying natural gene networks. Diverse environments can broaden the functionality of regulatory modules that respond to specific external signals. Yet, understanding the environmental response of gene networks and their host cell populations is not trivial. As the size of natural and synthetic gene networks demanding quantitative description increases, a new challenge will be to describe their behavior in various well-defined environments. It will be interesting to see how quantitative modeling can tackle the combinatorial complexity associated with tuning multiple environmental factors imposed on regulatory networks.</p>
