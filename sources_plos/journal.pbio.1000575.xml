<p>Lipoprotein receptor LRP1 play critical roles in lipid metabolism, and this study reveals a novel role for LRP1 in controlling food intake and obesity in the central nervous system of the adult mouse.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Obesity is a growing epidemic characterized by excess fat storage in adipocytes. Although lipoprotein receptors play important roles in lipid uptake, their role in controlling food intake and obesity is not known. Here we show that the lipoprotein receptor LRP1 regulates leptin signaling and energy homeostasis. Conditional deletion of the <italic>Lrp1</italic> gene in the brain resulted in an obese phenotype characterized by increased food intake, decreased energy consumption, and decreased leptin signaling. LRP1 directly binds to leptin and the leptin receptor complex and is required for leptin receptor phosphorylation and Stat3 activation. We further showed that deletion of the <italic>Lrp1</italic> gene specifically in the hypothalamus by Cre lentivirus injection is sufficient to trigger accelerated weight gain. Together, our results demonstrate that the lipoprotein receptor LRP1, which is critical in lipid metabolism, also regulates food intake and energy homeostasis in the adult central nervous system.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that at least 1 in 10 adults worldwide are obese, and in some western countries, a far greater percentage (25% or more) is affected. Obesity is a serious concern because it increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers, among other health problems. Despite recent advances in understanding the disease mechanism, effective treatments are still lacking. Lipoprotein receptors play critical roles in lipid metabolism, but their potential roles in controlling food intake and obesity in the central nervous system have not been examined. Here we show that deletion of LRP1, a member of the LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor family, in the adult mouse brain results in obese phenotype characterized by increased food intake, decreased energy consumption and decreased leptin signaling. We further show that deletion of the <italic>Lrp1</italic> gene specifically in the hypothalamus (a region of the brain) by using Cre lentivirus injection is sufficient to trigger accelerated weight gain. Together, our results present a novel function of LRP1: the direct regulation of leptin signaling and energy balance in the adult central nervous system. Hence, LRP1 represents a very promising new therapeutic target for the design of innovative and more effective therapies for obesity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a large cell surface receptor ubiquitously expressed in a variety of organs including adipose tissue, liver, and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Hussain1">[1]</xref>. Previous tissue-specific knockout studies showed that hepatic LRP1 mediates the metabolism of apolipoprotein E (apoE)-rich chylomicron remnants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Rohlmann1">[2]</xref> and that adipocyte LRP1 modulates postprandial lipid transport and glucose homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Hofmann1">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, LRP1 has a pivotal role in preventing atherosclerosis by restricting smooth muscle cell proliferation and protecting vascular wall integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Boucher1">[4]</xref>. In the central nervous system (CNS), LRP1 is highly expressed in neurons and plays critical roles in lipoprotein metabolism, neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, cell survival, and clearance of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Lillis1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Herz1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<title>Neuronal Deletion of <italic>Lrp1</italic> in the Adult Mouse Brain Leads to Obesity</title>
<p>To investigate the roles of LRP1 in the adult CNS, we generated conditional <italic>Lrp1</italic> forebrain knockout mice (LRP1-KO) by crossing <italic>Lrp1</italic> floxP mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Rohlmann1">[2]</xref> with αCamKII-Cre mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Tsien1">[8]</xref>. Because αCamKII-Cre is only expressed in neurons of the adult brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Tsien1">[8]</xref>, the essential function of LRP1 during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Herz2">[9]</xref> is preserved. <italic>Lrp1</italic> deletion in different brain regions was assessed by comparing LRP1 protein expression levels between LRP1-KO (<italic>Lrp1<sup>flox+/+</sup>/Cre<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup>, LRP1 knockout) and WT (<italic>Lrp1<sup>flox+/+</sup>/Cre</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup>, <italic>Lrp1</italic> floxP littermate control) mice at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo of age. LRP1 expression was not significantly decreased in the LRP1-KO mice at 3 mo of age. However, from 6 to 12 mo of age, LRP1 expression was decreased by ∼75% in the cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus of LRP1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s001">S1C</xref>). The residual LRP1 observed in these regions likely represents LRP1 expressed in glial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Moestrup1">[10]</xref>. Inactivation of the <italic>Lrp1</italic> gene was specific to the forebrain, as no changes in LRP1 expression were detected in the cerebellum or in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s001">Figure S1D and S1E</xref>).</p>
<p>LRP1-KO mice were apparently indistinguishable from control littermates during the first 6 mo of life but showed significantly accelerated body weight gain starting at 7 mo of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s002">S2A</xref>). This increased weight gain in LRP1-KO mice correlated closely with the observed decrease in LRP1 expression in the CNS. On a normal chow diet, LRP1-KO mice became obese at about 12 mo of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and had approximately 2-fold increased body fat content compared to their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). No changes in snout-anus length between LRP1-KO mice and WT mice were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). LRP1-KO mice ate significantly more than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and had significantly decreased energy expenditure, as revealed by decreased O<sub>2</sub> consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). Together, these results indicated that LRP1 expression in the brain controls body weight and adiposity by regulating food intake and energy expenditure.</p>

<p>Obesity in LRP1-KO mice was associated with hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance. LRP1-KO mice showed a 3-fold increase in circulating free fatty acids (FFA) and ∼50% increase in circulating triglycerides (TG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1G and 1H</xref>). Plasma cholesterol levels were not significantly altered in LRP1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). At about 12 mo of age, LRP1-KO mice showed approximately 2-fold increase in plasma insulin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1J</xref>). While fasting blood glucose levels appeared to be normal (unpublished data), LRP1-KO mice had significantly decreased tolerance to exogenous glucose when assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT). A marked increase in both magnitude and duration of blood glucose in response to glucose injection was observed in LRP1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). LRP1-KO mice also failed to reduce blood glucose levels after insulin injection (insulin tolerance test, ITT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1L</xref>). Thus, the obese phenotype in LRP1-KO mice was characterized by hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, resembling the metabolic syndrome pathology in humans.</p>

<title>LRP1 Regulates Leptin Signaling</title>
<p>Increase in fat storage observed in LRP1-KO mice was accompanied by approximately 5-fold increase in plasma leptin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g001">Figure 1M</xref>). Because leptin secreted by adipose tissue plays a major role in body weight regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Zhang1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Spiegelman1">[13]</xref>, we hypothesized an existing leptin-resistant condition in LRP1-KO mice. To directly assess a role for LRP1 in leptin signaling we measured the levels of phospho-Stat3 (P-Stat3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Bates1">[14]</xref> in the hypothalamus of LRP1-KO and WT mice. A significant decrease in the levels of P-Stat3 was observed in LRP1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s002">S2C, S2D</xref>). In addition, deletion of LRP1 in the adult brain led to leptin insensitivity as shown by impaired leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of hypothalamic Stat3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). Central leptin sensitivity was also evaluated by introcerebroventricular (ICV) leptin administration. Chronic ICV infusion of leptin caused a rapid reduction in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) and food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) in WT control mice but had minimal effects on LRP1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>), suggesting that LRP1 deletion led to leptin resistance.</p>

<p>(A) Hypothalamic phosphorylated Stat3 (P-Stat3) was decreased in neuronal LRP1-KO mice. Levels of P-Stat3 and total Stat3 in the hypothalamus of LRP1-KO and WT mice at 13 mo of age were evaluated by Western blotting. An equal amount of sample protein was loaded in each lane in this and subsequent figures. (B) Densitometric quantification of P-Stat3 and total Stat3 levels was performed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> (<italic>n</italic> = 4, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). (C) Deletion of LRP1 in adult brain led to decreased leptin sensitivity. LRP1-KO and WT mice at 12 mo of age were injected intraperitoneally with leptin (1 mg/kg body weight) or PBS as control. Hypothalamic extracts were prepared 45 min after injection. Levels of LRP1, P-Stat3, and total Stat3 were analyzed by Western blotting. (D) Densitometric quantification of P-Stat3 and total Stat3 levels was performed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> (<italic>n</italic> = 4, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). (E, F) Effect of ICV leptin or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) infusion on body weight (E) and food intake (F) in LRP1-KO and WT mice at 12 mo of age (<italic>n</italic> = 7). (G) Hypothalamic expression of genes encoding neuropeptides was compared between LRP1-KO and WT mice at 13 mo of age (<italic>n</italic> = 4, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; N.S., not significant) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. (H) GT1-7 cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA or LRP1-specific siRNA for 48 h, serum-starved overnight, and then treated with 50 nM leptin or control for 30 min. Levels of LRP1, P-Stat3, total Stat3, and ObR were analyzed by Western blotting. For P-ObR, extracts from GT1-7 cells were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and then immunoblotted with an anti-ObR antibody. (I) Densitometric analysis of Western blot samples (<italic>n</italic> = 4, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) indicates that knockdown of LRP1 greatly decreased the ratio of P-Stat3/Stat3 and the ratio of P-ObR/ObR. (J) GT1-7 cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA or LRP1-specific siRNA for 48 h. Extracts were prepared from GT1-7 cells and immunoprecipitated with either a control antibody or an anti-ObR antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-JAK2 antibody. Extracts were also directly immunoblotted with the ObR antibody, JAK2 antibody, and LRP1 antibody. (K) Extracts were prepared from GT1-7 cells and immunoprecipitated with either a control antibody or an anti-LRP1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-ObR antibody. Extracts were also directly immunoblotted with the anti-ObR antibody and anti-LRP1 antibody. (L) Ligand binding was performed by incubating GT1-7 cells with <sup>125</sup>I-leptin for 1 h at 4°C. Chemical crosslinking was then carried out, followed by immunoprecipitation with control antibody, anti-LRP1 antibody, anti-LRP1 antibody + full-length LRP1 protein, anti-leptin antibody, anti-leptin antibody + leptin protein, anti-ObR antibody, anti-ObR antibody + specific blocking peptide, or anti-LDLR antibody, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Error bars are mean ± s.e.m.</p>

<p>In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, leptin regulates energy imbalance by inhibiting expression of orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Spiegelman1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Seeley1">[17]</xref>. We found that deletion of LRP1 markedly increased NPY and AgRP mRNA levels in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Further, using immunofluorescence staining, we demonstrated that LRP1 colocalized with AgRP but not with POMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s003">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that LRP1 may specifically regulate leptin signaling in AgRP neurons. These results are consistent with compromised leptin signaling in the hypothalamus of LRP1-KO mice and further support leptin signaling as the potential mechanism by which LRP1 regulates food intake and energy expenditure in the adult mice.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying LRP1 regulation of leptin signaling we used GT1-7 cells, a neuronal cell line derived from the mouse hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Mellon1">[18]</xref>. LRP1 knockdown in GT1-7 cells by LRP1-specific siRNA significantly decreased the phosphorylation of both Stat3 and leptin receptor ObR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2H, 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s004">S4A</xref>). While treatment of control GT1-7 cells with leptin dramatically increased the phosphorylation of both Stat3 and ObR, it only had lesser effects on LRP1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2H, 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s005M">S5</xref>). In addition, we found that LRP1 knockdown significantly reduced the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is also downstream to the leptin receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s004">Figure S4B and S4C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Myers1">[19]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that the leptin receptor mediates Stat3 phosphorylation via janus kinase 2 (JAK2) activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Spiegelman1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Schwartz1">[15]</xref>. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that LRP1 knockdown in GT1-7 cells decreased the interaction between ObR and JAK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s006">S6A, S6B, S6D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s007">S7A</xref>). We also found that LRP1 knockdown decreased leptin-mediated phosphorylation of JAK2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s007">Figure S7B and S7C</xref>).</p>
<p>Because LRP1 had been previously shown to serve as co-receptor to PDGF signaling via the PDGF receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Boucher1">[4]</xref>, we next examined the potential for a direct association between LRP1 and the leptin receptor. Using GT1-7 cellular extracts, we found that the LRP1 antibody, but not a control antibody, co-immunoprecipitated the leptin receptor ObR in the presence of leptin but not in the absence of leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s006">S6C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s006">S6E</xref>).

Under these conditions, radiolabeled leptin migrated as a high molecular weight complex on SDS-PAGE that was immunoreactive with leptin, leptin receptor, and LRP1 antibodies, but not with a control antibody or an antibody to the LDL receptor (LDLR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g002">Figure 2L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s006">S6F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s008">S8</xref>). The specificity of each antibody in these co-immunoprecipitation experiments was confirmed by antigen blocking.

<title>Hypothalamic LRP1 Regulates Food Intake and Energy Homeostasis</title>
<p>The hypothalamus is central to the control of food intake and energy expenditure; therefore LRP1 deletion in the hypothalamus of LRP1-KO mice is likely the major contributor to the obese phenotype.

<title>Overexpression of LRP1 Rescues the Metabolic Phenotype and Leptin Signaling</title>
<p>Having demonstrated that deletion of LRP1 led to obesity and decreased leptin signaling, we were prompted to evaluate whether overexpression of LRP1 could rescue the obese phenotype. Co-expression of mLRP2, a functional LRP1 minireceptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Zerbinatti1">[21]</xref>, reduced the body weight gain and ameliorated the hyperphagia associated with hypothalamic cre overexpression in <italic>Lrp1</italic> floxp mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). mLRP2 also partially restored leptin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000575-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>).

<p>Leptin binding to the long form of the leptin receptor (ObRb) stimulates the tyrosine kinase JAK2 to phosphorylate Stat3 at tyrosine residues. P-Stat3 dimers subsequently enter the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes, such as AgRP and POMC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Spiegelman1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Schwartz1">[15]</xref>. We found that LRP1 directly binds to leptin and the leptin receptor complex and is required for leptin receptor phosphorylation and Stat3 activation. Further, LRP1 knockdown in GT1-7 cells decreased the interaction between leptin receptor and JAK2, which reduced the leptin-mediated phosphorylation of JAK2. Interestingly, LRP1 is expressed in AgRP but not in POMC neurons, and disruption of LRP1 significantly increases the expression of AgRP and NPY, indicating that LRP1 deletion impairs lepitn signaling in AgRP neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that LRP1 modulates leptin signaling likely via regulation of JAK2 activation in AgRP neurons.</p>
<p>It has been reported that leptin receptors are also expressed in various cortical regions and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Huang1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Burguera1">[23]</xref>, which are associated with learning and memory. In leptin receptor-deficient mice, hippocampal CA1 region exhibits impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Li1">[24]</xref>, which are widely considered major cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Further, leptin enhances NMDA receptor function and modulates hippocampal synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Shanley1">[25]</xref>. LRP1 is also widely expressed in the cortex and hippocampus and play essential roles in neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Lillis1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Herz1">[7]</xref>. LRP1 deletion in the cortex and hippocampus region may also decrease leptin signaling and further affect synaptic function, learning, and memory.</p>
<p>Neuronal inactivation of LRP1 achieved by expression of the Cre transgene under control of the synapsin I promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Zhu1">[26]</xref> has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-May1">[27]</xref>. Unlike the CamKII-Cre model, in which <italic>Lrp1</italic> disruption was restricted to the forebrain and hypothalamic areas, LRP1 deletion in the Syn-Cre model was detectable much earlier and throughout the entire CNS, first manifesting by impairment of motor function and systemic tremors about 3 wk after birth. SynI-Cre/<italic>Lrp1</italic> mutant mice were also hyperphagic, but in contrast to the CamKII-Cre/<italic>Lrp1</italic> model, they were hyperkatabolic, and the majority of Syn-Cre/<italic>Lrp1</italic> mice died prematurely between 6 and 9 mo of age. This severe and earlier phenotype emphasized a critical role for CNS LRP1 in motor circuitry and muscle control but effectively occluded another pivotal role for LRP1 in the CNS, i.e., the regulation of leptin signaling and metabolic homeostasis described here.</p>
<p>In summary, we have uncovered a new molecular pathway that regulates leptin signaling and energy homeostasis. Our results demonstrate that LRP1, a lipoprotein receptor that plays important roles in lipid metabolism, also regulates food intake and body energy homeostasis in the CNS. Because ICV administration of apoE was recently shown to suppress food intake in the rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000575-Shen1">[28]</xref>, it is plausible to speculate that brain lipoproteins may also play a role in regulating food intake, likely via LRP1. Interestingly, we found that LRP1 knockout resulted in increased apoE levels in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000575.s012">Figure S12</xref>), consistent with the fact that apoE metabolism is impaired in the LRP1 deficient mice. Therefore, LRP1 provides a critical link between peripheral and central energy metabolism and could serve as a novel therapeutic target to lessen obesity in human patients.</p>
