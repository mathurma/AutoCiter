<abstract>
<p>In vivo, antibiotics are often much less efficient than ex vivo and relapses can occur. The reasons for poor in vivo activity are still not completely understood. We have studied the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin in an animal model for complicated Salmonellosis. High-dose ciprofloxacin treatment efficiently reduced pathogen loads in feces and most organs. However, the cecum draining lymph node (cLN), the gut tissue, and the spleen retained surviving bacteria. In cLN, approximately 10%–20% of the bacteria remained viable. These phenotypically tolerant bacteria lodged mostly within CD103<sup>+</sup>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>−</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, remained genetically susceptible to ciprofloxacin, were sufficient to reinitiate infection after the end of the therapy, and displayed an extremely slow growth rate, as shown by mathematical analysis of infections with mixed inocula and segregative plasmid experiments. The slow growth was sufficient to explain recalcitrance to antibiotics treatment. Therefore, slow-growing antibiotic-tolerant bacteria lodged within dendritic cells can explain poor in vivo antibiotic activity and relapse. Administration of LPS or CpG, known elicitors of innate immune defense, reduced the loads of tolerant bacteria. Thus, manipulating innate immunity may augment the in vivo activity of antibiotics.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Antibiotics that are known to kill bacteria in vitro can be less efficacious in vivo. The reasons for this have remained poorly understood. Using a mouse model for <italic>Salmonella</italic> diarrhea, we found that bacterial persistence occurs in the presence of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin because <italic>Salmonella</italic> can exist in two different states: as a fast-growing population that spreads in the host's tissues and as a slow-growing “persister” subpopulation. The slow-growing bacteria infect and hide out inside dendritic cells of the host's immune system and cannot be attacked by the antibiotic—they are thereby rendered “tolerant,” despite their genetic susceptibility to the drug. These tolerant bacteria form a reservoir of viable cells that are able to reinitiate the infection on cessation of antibiotic therapy. Fortunately, however, these tolerant <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells are not invincible, and can be killed by adding agents that directly stimulate the host's immune defense. Combining innate immune stimulants with antibiotic treatment may offer new opportunities to improve antibacterial therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibiotics are of great importance for treating bacterial infections. However, the resistance of bacteria against antibiotics has remained a significant problem of global concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Nathan1">[1]</xref>. Resistance can be conferred by resistance determinants encoded in the pathogen's genome, as well as by “noninherited resistance” (also termed “phenotypic tolerance” or “persistence”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Levin1">[2]</xref>). Such tolerance is a phenotypic adaptation allowing survival of genotypically susceptible bacteria at antibiotic concentrations exceeding the “minimal inhibitory concentration” (MIC). Although the molecular basis of phenotypic tolerance is still not entirely clear, the bacterial growth rate is often a cardinal factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Lewis1">[3]</xref>. Most (if not all) genetically susceptible bacteria are exquisitely susceptible during exponential growth, but display tolerance against diverse classes of antibiotics in the stationary phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Levin1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Lee1">[4]</xref>. Early hints and a growing body of anecdotal observations suggest that slow pathogen growth rates in vivo may explain why antibiotics therapy in vivo takes much longer and is much less efficient than predicted from ex vivo analysis of exponentially grown cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Eagle1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Wood1">[7]</xref>. To verify this hypothesis, we would need robust experimental systems quantifying the growth rates of tolerant bacteria in vivo.</p>
<p>To study bacterial tolerance to antibiotics in vivo, we have chosen the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Tm). In humans, the majority of cases develop “noncomplicated,” self-limiting diarrhea, where the pathogen remains restricted to the gut lumen, gut tissue, and the gut-associated lymphatic tissue. However, in complicated cases (i.e., young children, elderly, immunocompromised patients), <italic>S.</italic> Tm spreads beyond the gut-draining lymph nodes and to systemic sites, thus causing a life-threatening infection. In these cases, antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin; typically two doses of approximately 7 mg/kg per day) are used for therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Onwuezobe1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Sirinavin1">[9]</xref>. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum gyrase inhibitors, interfere with bacterial DNA replication, enhance bacterial DNA fragmentation, and display bactericidal activity against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Davis1">[10]</xref>. However, in spite of exquisite in vitro activity (within minutes to hours), and excellent tissue penetration characteristics of fluoroquinolones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Colino1">[11]</xref>, the in vivo activity is generally much lower, requiring treatment for at least 5–10 d with frequent relapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Butler1">[12]</xref>, increased risks of long-term carriage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Onwuezobe1">[8]</xref>, and long-term persistence of the pathogen in blood and bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Gasem1">[13]</xref>. Before the introduction of efficient antiretroviral therapy, AIDS patients displayed high susceptibility to complicated <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection. Antibiotic therapy did relieve the symptoms. However, due to high rates of relapse, many AIDS patients underwent life-long antibiotic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-DeWit1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Jacobs1">[15]</xref>). Intriguingly, the bacteria re-isolated from relapses do generally remain genetically susceptible to the respective antibiotic. Thus, tolerance might play a significant role. It has remained enigmatic why the pathogen is tolerant to antibiotic therapy in vivo, how this may impact the pathogen–host interaction, and how tolerant bacteria can be eliminated.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We analyzed antibiotic tolerance of <italic>S.</italic> Tm in vivo in an intragastric mouse infection model using C57BL/6 mice, which are susceptible to enteropathy and systemic spread of the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Barthel1">[16]</xref>. This model displays the typical features of complicated Salmonellosis—that is, diarrhea accompanied by pathogen spread to the cecal lymph node (cLN) and systemic sites. Without antibiotic treatment, the mice would succumb to systemic infection by wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium within 5 to 6 d. In this model, therapy with two doses of 15 mg/kg ciprofloxacin per day is known to reduce fecal pathogen shedding and systemic pathogen loads. However, viable pathogens could be recovered from the cLN and relapse occurs at high frequency soon after the discontinuation of the therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Endt1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>To establish the kinetics of pathogen clearance by ciprofloxacin, we infected mice with <italic>S.</italic> Tm (strain SL1344, 5×10<sup>7</sup> cfu by gavage) and began high-dose ciprofloxacin treatment from day one postinfection (2×62 mg/kg per day by gavage). This high dosage of ciprofloxacin was chosen to achieve systemic antibiotic concentrations of ≥50-fold the MIC throughout the duration of the experiment (MIC≤0.03 µg/ml as determined by the in vitro plating assay; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s018">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and to ensure pathogen clearance from the gut lumen of all mice (in spite of reduced gut luminal bioavailability—e.g., through antibiotic absorption by food particles). This allowed us to focus on the tolerant bacteria in the host tissue.</p>
<p>Within 3 h of ciprofloxacin treatment, the pathogen was cleared from the gut lumen and pathogen spread to the spleen was prevented by the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In contrast, ciprofloxacin did not clear the pathogen from the gut-draining cLN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). cLN-loads declined with fast kinetics by 10-fold during the first 2 h after ciprofloxacin administration. This indicated that ciprofloxacin is bio-active at this site. After the first 2 h, the killing kinetics slowed down and 50–1,000 viable bacteria remained for up to 10 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Such bi-phasic killing is a typical feature if pathogens form a tolerant subpopulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Lewis1">[3]</xref>. Indeed, bi-phasic killing is also observed if <italic>S.</italic> Tm bacteria taken from the logarithmic growth phase are exposed to ciprofloxacin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). However, in this case, only &lt;0.1% of the bacteria survived after 6 h. This provided a first hint that pathogen–host interactions in vivo might affect poor pathogen elimination from the cLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Subsequent experiments established that the cecal gut tissue and the cecal patch may also harbor <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium cells surviving the antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Please note that these numbers have to be interpreted with caution, as gut luminal contamination [i.e., from relapses (see, below) or bacteria closely associated with the mucosal surface] cannot be completely ruled out. We also observed some antibiotic-tolerant bacteria in the spleens at 10 d after infection or even earlier if the ciprofloxacin treatment was started on days 2 or 3 postinfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In that case, the starting loads in the spleen were equivalent, but the fraction of surviving <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium cells was much lower than in the cLN (0.5%–5% as compared to ∼20%; compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s004">Figure S4B</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These data established that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium cells can survive antibiotic treatment at several sites within the mouse. The cLN was chosen for subsequent analyses, as this site harbors a high fraction of surviving bacteria, is easily retrievable without the risk of contamination, and allows fast and efficient tissue dissociation for FACS.</p>
<p>In order to verify that the surviving <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium cells were indeed “tolerant,” we have performed a number of control experiments. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the ciprofloxacin concentration always remained ≥50-fold above the minimal concentration required for inhibiting <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth ex vivo (MIC&lt;0.03 µg/ml; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s018">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, tissue culture infection experiments and confocal fluorescence microscopy verified that ciprofloxacin is indeed efficiently penetrating into infected host cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In line with the fast initial killing rate in the cLN of an antibiotic-treated mouse, these data verified a high bioavailability of ciprofloxacin in the tissues of interest. Furthermore, pathogen survival was not attributable to genetic changes, as all re-isolated colonies tested remained ciprofloxacin sensitive (same MIC as parental strain; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s018">Table S1</xref>) and fully virulent when transferred into naïve hosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, the cLN provides an environment that selects for or induces antibiotic-tolerant bacteria. Tolerant bacteria were observed in the cLN no matter when the treatment was started (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s004">Figure S4</xref>), or which mouse line or pathogen strain was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s007">Figure S7</xref>, <italic>nramp</italic>-positive 129SvEv mice; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s008">Figure S8</xref>, <italic>S.</italic> Tm ATCC14028). Thus, in our mouse model, the cLN are a site harboring phenotypically tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm. However, it had remained unclear if these bacteria were capable of causing a relapse, as observed a few days after the end of such an antibiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Endt1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The capacity of tolerant bacteria from the cLN to cause a relapse-like infection was analyzed in cell transfer experiments. We have chosen the cLN population for this experiment, because it harbors a high density of tolerant cells and allows cell retrieval with minimal risk of contamination (e.g., from gut luminal contents). This cell transfer technique allowed us to focus on the bacteria located within the cLN, as all pathogens detected in the recipient animal must originate from this organ, while contributions of other bacterial populations (e.g., gut mucosa, cecal patch, spleen, or other, nonidentified organs), which might serve as additional reservoirs of tolerant bacteria, could be excluded. Donor mice (C57BL/6) were infected with <italic>S.</italic> Tm as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g001">Figure 1</xref>, while the acceptor mice remained uninfected during this initial phase of the experiment. One day later, high-dose ciprofloxacin therapy was applied to both groups. After 2 d of therapy, the infected mice were sacrificed and we recovered the cecum content, the cLN, and the spleens. Single cell suspensions were prepared from each sample and pathogen loads were verified by plating an aliquot. In line with the findings above, no bacteria were detected in the cecum contents or the spleens of the donor mice, while a total of ∼1,000 bacteria had survived therapy in the cLN. The remainder of the cell suspension was injected into the peritoneal cavity of noninfected recipient mice. As a control for viable, but nontolerant bacteria, we infected a fourth group of mice with <italic>S.</italic> Tm (500 cfu i.p.) from an early log-phase culture. These bacteria should be highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin levels present in the recipient mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s009">Figure S9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Zeiler1">[18]</xref>). After the cell transfer, the ciprofloxacin treatment of the recipients was discontinued so that antibiotic concentrations drop gradually (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Four days later, recipient mice were sacrificed and pathogen loads in the respective organs were determined. Transfer of cLN cells leads to significantly higher infection rates compared to transferred spleen cells, cecum content, or <italic>S.</italic> Tm cultured in LB (Fisher's exact test: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0048; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g002">Figure 2</xref>, left part; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s010">Figure S10</xref>). This is consistent with the high fraction of tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium cells observed in the cLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The loads in spleens and livers of the recipient mice were equivalent to those observed upon discontinuation of ciprofloxacin treatment in the donor mice (“relapse control”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g002">Figure 2</xref>, right part; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s010">Figure S10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Endt1">[17]</xref>). In contrast, cLN and gut luminal colonization were much lower in the recipient animals than in the relapse control. This may suggest that the site of re-seeding affects the colonization patterns during a relapse. In conclusion, the cell transfer experiments verified that the tolerant pathogens surviving in the cLN are indeed capable of re-initiating infection and can therefore account for relapses. However, it remained unclear whether the in vivo tolerance was linked to a particular intracellular niche of the cLN.</p>

Initially, we focused on dendritic cells, as these are important host cells during intestinal infection that can engulf and transport viable bacteria within the gut and the associated lymphatic tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Hopkins1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Diehl1">[25]</xref>. CD11c-YFP mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Lindquist1">[26]</xref>, which express a fluorescent marker protein in dendritic cells, were infected with <italic>S.</italic> Tm (pRFP; red fluorescence) for 1 d and treated (or not) with ciprofloxacin. In the cLN of untreated mice, the bacteria were located within dendritic cells (CD11c<sup>+</sup>; 53%) and other cells (CD11c<sup>−</sup>; 47%), as detected by fluorescence microscopy. Upon ciprofloxacin therapy, most remaining bacteria were located within CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells (&gt;80%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). It should be noted that this method did not allow us to establish if all detected bacteria were indeed still alive. Nevertheless, these data suggested that dendritic cells might represent a niche harboring tolerant bacteria.</p>

<p>In a complementary approach, we have analyzed the cell types harboring viable <italic>S.</italic> Tm by fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS). As bacterial loads in the cLN of ciprofloxacin treated mice were very low compared to the numbers of host cells (10<sup>2</sup>–2×10<sup>3</sup> cfu versus 10<sup>7</sup> cLN cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s004">Figure S4</xref>), the background noise of standard FACS was too high for a reliable analysis. Therefore, we have developed a FACS sorting protocol with subsequent plating of the sorted pools (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This allowed highly sensitive detection of viable bacterial cells within subpopulations of cLN cells. For the experiment, we used CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>gfp/+</sup> transgenic mice that express <italic>gfp</italic> in particular monocyte populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Jung1">[27]</xref>. These animals were infected for 3 d with <italic>S.</italic> Tm and treated (or not) during the last day with ciprofloxacin (2×62 mg/kg by gavage). Our data above indicated that about 1,000 <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells survive the antibiotic treatment in the cLN. The cLN was harvested, dissociated, and stained as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Gating for CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>−</sup>CD19<sup>−</sup> cells allowed us to focus on two particular cLN cell populations, the CD103<sup>−</sup>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> interstitial dendritic cells (iDCs) and the “classical” CD103<sup>+</sup>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>−</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (cDCs), which transport antigens from the mucosa to the cLN and are thought to be key antigen-presenting cells of the gut-associated immune system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Varol1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Tamoutounour1">[29]</xref>). Ciprofloxacin treatment affected the frequency of iDCs and cDCs in the cLN by no more than 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel). The same was true for the <italic>S.</italic> Tm loads of the cDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). In contrast, the <italic>S.</italic> Tm loads in the iDC plummeted by &gt;10-fold in the ciprofloxacin-treated mice. These data are consistent with the microscopic analysis and indicated that cDC represent a key reservoir for tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm in the cLN of antibiotic-treated mice. The <italic>S.</italic> Tm population localized in cDC seems to feature a particularly high fraction of tolerant bacteria.</p>
<p>In order to assess the importance of the dendritic cells as a niche for tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm by independent means, we manipulated the number of dendritic cells via two well-established experimental systems. In the first experiment, dendritic cell numbers were reduced. For this purpose, we used a transgenic mouse (CD11c-DTR<sup>+/−</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Jung2">[30]</xref>) that allows dendritic cell depletion via diphtheria toxin (DTX; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These mice (or nontransgenic controls) were infected with <italic>S.</italic> Tm, treated for 2 d with ciprofloxacin, and dendritic cells were depleted during the last day of the therapy. This reduced the load of <italic>S.</italic> Tm surviving ciprofloxacin treatment in the cLN (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, left side). Conversely, increasing dendritic cell numbers by treating with Flt-3 ligand, a well-characterized agent expanding the dendritic cell population (i.e., cDC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Maraskovsky1">[31]</xref>), resulted in elevated <italic>S.</italic> Tm loads in the cLNs of ciprofloxacin-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, right side). These data confirmed dendritic cells as an important niche for antibiotic-tolerant bacteria in the cLN.</p>
<p>It had remained unclear how tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells do emerge. Is there a preexisting tolerant fraction of <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells that is enriched in the host's dendritic cells? Alternatively, the intracellular environment within a host cell might induce slow growth and tolerance in a fraction of the phagocytosed bacteria. In a first approach to address this question, we have performed in vitro infection experiments in bone-marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and analyzed the fraction of <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells surviving ciprofloxacin treatment. We have compared the in vitro killing kinetics of the internalized bacteria with those of the inoculum. Bacteria residing within BMDCs displayed a higher fraction of tolerant cells than the bacteria of the inoculum (∼3% versus ∼0.06%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s011">Figure S11</xref>). This may suggest that physiological changes during phagocytosis and/or phagosome maturation may induce tolerance. Alternatively, the BMDC may “enrich” tolerant bacteria from the inoculum—for example, by killing fast-growing intracellular <italic>S.</italic> Tm populations or by cell death of those BMDCs phagocytosing fast-growing bacteria. Anyway, our observations are in line with earlier work detecting slow-growing <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells during ex vivo infection of macrophages and BMDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Helaine1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Abshire1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Niedergang1">[36]</xref>. However, it had remained unclear if this would also occur in vivo.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that a slow in vivo growth rate may explain the pathogen's antibiotic tolerance in the cLN. This seemed plausible as earlier work had shown that many bacterial species can become antibiotic tolerant in the stationary phase when bacterial growth is extremely slow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Nathan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Wood1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Zeiler1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Gilbert1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Evans1">[38]</xref>. Moreover, tolerant <italic>Salmonella</italic> populations were indeed detectable in fluoroquinolone-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Endt1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Barat1">[39]</xref>; this work). Though suggestive, none of these studies was able to establish that tolerant pathogen populations in an infected host were indeed growing slowly. Therefore, we needed evidence linking pathogen growth rates in vivo to the observed recalcitrance to antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p>Determining the replication rate of bacteria in vivo constitutes a challenge. Simply counting the number of bacteria in an anatomical compartment does not allow disentangling replication, migration, and clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>. However, parameters characterizing these processes can be estimated with a population dynamical analysis of infection experiments conducted with mixtures of differentially tagged strains. In theory, fluctuations in the proportions of the differentially tagged strains are indicative of population bottlenecks during migration between and replication within host compartments, and can be used to estimate the population dynamical parameters (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>To that end, we devised a novel approach extending our recent work on the population dynamics of cLN colonization by <italic>S.</italic> Tm in the mouse model for complicated Salmonellosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>. The original method employed a defined mixture of differentially tagged, isogenic <italic>S.</italic> Tm strains—that is, wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Tm (SL1344 <italic>S.</italic> Tm) spiked with limiting amounts of phenotypically identical strains (<italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup>). These strains are isogenic to wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Tm, except for a 40-nucleotide sequence, which serves as an identifiable neutral marker that can be quantified by real-time qPCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Grant1">[41]</xref>. The inoculum contained a total of seven different <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup>, each carrying a unique 40 nucleotide sequence (mixed in a 1∶1∶1∶1∶1∶1∶1 ratio) and a 20-fold excess of untagged wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Tm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>, this work; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s012">Figure S12</xref>). In our initial work, this approach was used to estimate the net bacterial replication rate in the cLN by analyzing the <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup> infection data with a stochastic birth-death model extended by immigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>. The model predicted the fraction of strains that successfully migrated to the cLN and their population size as a function of the rate of immigration, <italic>μ</italic>, replication, <italic>r</italic>, and clearance, <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Fitting this model to our experimentally determined number of each tagged strain in the cLN, we could infer rates at which bacteria immigrate into the cLN (298 bacteria during the first 24 h p.i.) and replicate therein. The validity and robustness of this approach was verified analyzing <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup> infections in wild-type and knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>. In our present analysis of the tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells in the cLN, we used these parameters to estimate the composition of the <italic>S.</italic> Tm population at the beginning of the ciprofloxacin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>), and extended this approach to quantify the growth rate of the <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells surviving the ciprofloxacin treatment in the cLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s012">Figure S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s020">Text S1</xref>).</p>

During the first 24 h p.i., we analyzed cLN colonization dynamics in absence of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin treatment was started by 24 h p.i. and continued until day 3, 5, or 10, as indicated.

<p>The population dynamics experiment had two phases. First, infection was established for 24 h with a mixture of <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 35–49 data points per group; 7 differentially tagged <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup> strains). Second, high-dose ciprofloxacin treatment was started at 24 h p.i. This rapidly diminished pathogen loads in the gut lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), and thus, de novo immigration into the cLN can be neglected in our analysis of this second phase of the experiment. The number of each <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup> in the cLN was determined experimentally at days 1, 3, 5, and 10 postinfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s019">Table S2</xref>). From these data, we could determine both the doubling time and the clearance rate of the surviving bacteria in the cLN for each time period separately (i.e., days 1–3, 3–5, and 5–10; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s012">Figure S12</xref>). During the first period of the treatment (days 1–3), susceptible bacteria were killed and the persistent bacteria remained in the lymph node. Thus, the population dynamics will represent the aggregate of both processes (that is, the average over the dynamics of the two subpopulations, not the aggregate of replication and clearance), and the apparent in vivo doubling time was about 3.6 h. In the subsequent two periods, we could analyze the population dynamics of the tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells in isolation. Indeed, the doubling time increased to 8.8 h (days 3–5) and 44 h between days 5 and 10 of the therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref>). In this period, the clearance rate dropped to extremely low levels (&lt;0.01/h), indicating that the half-life of bacteria that survived the ciprofloxacin in the cLN exceeded 100 h. We do not know if <italic>S.</italic> Tm forms different types of tolerant subpopulations. This might explain why the doubling time and the half-life of the tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells increased between days 3 and 10 of the treatment. In any case, these data established that the antibiotic-tolerant bacteria enter a persistent state characterized by extremely slow replication and virtually no clearance.</p>
<p>To confirm the slow growth rates of tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells in vivo, we employed a plasmid-dilution strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g005">Figure 5</xref>, left side). pAM34 is an IPTG-addicted plasmid that stops replication as soon as IPTG is removed from the environment, including all mouse tissues analyzed (pAM34, Amp<sup>R</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Gil1">[42]</xref>). This type of plasmid can be used to verify the slow growth rate of the ciprofloxacin-tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm subpopulation. Such tolerant cells should survive the antibiotic and should feature a high fraction of cells retaining pAM34.</p>

<p>Three groups of mice were infected with <italic>S.</italic> Tm (pAM34). One group was sacrificed at day 2 p.i. to assess cLN loads and the fraction of bacteria still retaining the plasmid. Here we observed the typical pathogen loads of approximately 10,000 cfu in the cLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g005">Figure 5</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Approximately 100 of these bacteria were still carrying pAM34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g005">Figure 5</xref>, open symbols). The second group was left untreated, analyzed at day 3 p.i., and served as a control. The third group was treated with ciprofloxacin from day 2 on and analyzed at day 3 p.i. Here, we observed significantly reduced total pathogen loads in the cLN (1,000–2,000 cfu; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), while the total loads of pAM34 carrying <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells did not differ significantly from those at day 2 or the control mice at day 3 p.i. (50–100 bacteria; <italic>p</italic>≥0.05). These findings are consistent with our data presented above and indicate that <italic>S.</italic> Tm does form a susceptible and a tolerant subpopulation in the cLN. Based on that data, we reasoned that approximately 80%–90% of the total cLN bacteria displayed the fast-growing/susceptible phenotype, while 10%–20% belonged to the slow-growing/tolerant phenotype. If slow-growing bacteria would exist in the cLN even in the absence of ciprofloxacin, most of the pAM34 should reside in such slow-growing/tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells at day 2 p.i., before the onset of ciprofloxacin treatment. These should survive the ciprofloxacin treatment and thereby account for the high loads of pAM34-positive <italic>S.</italic> Tm at day 3 p.i. This is supported by the data from the group of mice infected for 2 d with <italic>S.</italic> Tm (pAM34) and treated with ciprofloxacin during the third day of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Here the susceptible <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells were eliminated, while tolerant cells prevailed and the number of bacteria retaining pAM34 did not drop significantly. This confirmed that the ciprofloxacin-tolerant cells were harboring the bulk of the pAM34 plasmid observed at day 2 p.i. and provided in vivo evidence that the slow-growing/tolerant subpopulation exists within the cLN (presumably within classical dendritic cells) even in the absence of ciprofloxacin. These findings are in line with the ex vivo data by Helaine and Holden, who observed by elegant fluorescence microscopy techniques that some fraction of internalized <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium cells grow at a strikingly low rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Helaine1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>From the pAM34 data of the ciprofloxacin-treated mice we could roughly estimate the doubling time of the tolerant bacteria. We assumed that the bacteria had reached the cLN by 12 h p.i., resided at this site for 60 h, and displayed the tolerant, slow-growing phenotype throughout these 60 h. On this basis we could take the pAM34 frequencies of the inoculum and of the cLN resident bacteria at day 3 p.i. to estimate a doubling time of 8.9 h for the tolerant phenotype. This value is strikingly similar to that observed in our population dynamics experiments [8.8 h (7.1–11.8 h) at days 3–5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g004">Figure 4C</xref>] and further supports that tolerance is growing indeed quite slowly in vivo.</p>
<p>A second phenomenon observed in the ciprofloxacin treatment was a reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression signature of the cLN (reduced <italic>cxcl2</italic>, <italic>ifng</italic>, <italic>s100a9</italic>, <italic>lcn2</italic> expression; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s013">Figure S13</xref>). Overall, these data suggested that the antibiotic treatment may have two effects in parallel. First of all, it reduces the total bacterial burden in the cLN by killing the susceptible bacteria. This dampens the pro-inflammatory response in the tissue. Second, it might be of importance that the tolerant bacteria do not just survive the ciprofloxacin treatment. They may in fact face a reduced pro-inflammatory defense in the cLN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s013">Figure S13</xref>). One might speculate that this further enhances the survival of tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells in the tissue. It will be an important task for future work to dissect which environmental signals do induce slow growth/tolerance by <italic>S.</italic> Tm and whether/how this is affected by pro-inflammatory signaling in the infected tissue.</p>
<p>Finally, we were interested to identify a strategy for reducing loads of ciprofloxacin-tolerant pathogens in wild-type hosts. Earlier work had indicated that antibiotics and the host's immune system may cooperate in eliminating pathogens during antibiotic therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-McCune1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-McCune2">[44]</xref>. Furthermore, the antibiotic-treated lymph node displays a signature of reduced innate immune defense (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s013">Figure S13</xref>). Based on such observations, it has been speculated that triggering innate responses during the antibiotic treatment may allow reducing the number of persistent bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Nathan1">[1]</xref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been substantiated by experimental data in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we applied a PRR ligand. Mice were infected for 1 d with <italic>S.</italic> Tm and treated with ciprofloxacin alone (2×62 mg/kg per day), LPS alone (one dose of 5 µg at 48 h p.i.), or ciprofloxacin and LPS. Indeed, a single dose of LPS applied during the ciprofloxacin treatment elicited within 2 h an innate immune response in the cLN and significantly reduced the number of tolerant bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s013">Figure S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s014">Figure S14</xref>). In six animals the pathogen loads were reduced below the limit of detection (red arrowhead; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Loads of tolerant bacteria were also reduced in the cecum wall and the cecal patch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s015">Figure S15</xref>). However, it had remained unclear whether elimination of tolerant bacteria was attributable to direct or to indirect (paracrine) signaling to the infected host cell. In a first approach, we have generated mixed bone marrow chimeric mice. These mice displayed 50%–70% <italic>tlr4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cDC and 30%–50% wt cDC. Only the latter should directly respond to LPS, while both should respond to paracrine signaling. When these mice (or wt control animals) were infected with <italic>S.</italic> Tm(pAM34) and treated with ciprofloxacin and LPS, we observed the same strong reduction of the cLN loads (and pAM34 retention), as in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001793.s016">Figure S16</xref>). This suggested that LPS can affect tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells via an indirect, paracrine mechanism.</p>

Ciprofloxacin treatment (2×62 mg/kg/d) was started at day 1 p.i. and continued until the end of the experiment, as indicated. The indicated groups were treated with a single dose of LPS (5 µg intraperitoneally) or CpG (100 µg intraperitoneally) at day 2 p.i. Cfus in the cLN were analyzed by plating.

<p>A second PRR-ligand, CpG, was also capable of reducing the tissue load of tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These data demonstrated that the persistent bacteria lodged within the cLN dendritic cells are indeed susceptible to innate immune responses and that the PRR-agonists LPS and CpG can supplement antibiotic treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In conclusion, high-dosed ciprofloxacin is capable of reducing <italic>S.</italic> Tm populations from most sites of the infected host. However, a fraction of the bacteria survives the treatment. In the cLN, approximately 10% survive in a persistent state and the “classical” cDCs seem to represent a niche harboring a very high fraction of ciprofloxacin-tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the cDCs play an important role in antigen sampling by the gut-associated immune system. Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that it is exactly the dendritic cells' function in adaptive mucosal immunity—that is, microbe transport to the draining lymph nodes and prolonged antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Diehl1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Belkaid1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Tam1">[47]</xref>, which might generate (e.g., induce or select for) the tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm subpopulation. It remains to be shown whether this also holds true for human patients treated for complicated infections by <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. or other gut pathogens. Such pathogen–host interactions and their effects on antibiotic therapy will be of broad importance for infection biology and represent an interesting topic for future work. The experimental framework developed using the infection model for complicated Salmonellosis could enable such studies. Considering the broad variety of pathogens, the diversity of niches within the host, the multitude of virulence factors, and the vastly differing average growth rates within hosts displayed by pathogens, it seems likely that such work will reveal pathogen-specific adaptations and common mechanisms explaining recalcitrance to antibiotic therapy. Clearly, deciphering the population dynamics of pathogens within their hosts will be of key importance for understanding the infection process and developing improved therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>It is still not entirely clear how bacteria can obtain an antibiotic-tolerant phenotype, whether different bacteria might employ different strategies, and how host–cell interactions might affect tolerance. Originally, a tolerant subpopulation was discovered in <italic>S. aureus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Bigger1">[48]</xref>. Later, this phenotype has been observed in most bacterial species analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Lewis1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Lewis2">[49]</xref>. Bacterial populations of identical genotypes do generally feature a fraction of cells that are more resistant to a given antibiotic than the others. The size of this fraction can increase in response to external stimuli, including nutrient limitation, quorum sensing signals, antibiotics, or oxidative stress. This engages signaling mechanisms within the bacterial cell, including the SOS response and toxin–antitoxin systems, which are finally thought to reduce the bacterial growth rate and/or elicit tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Lewis1">[3]</xref>. In conjunction with earlier observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Jantsch1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Helaine1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Niedergang1">[36]</xref>, our data suggest that slow growth and concomitant antibiotic tolerance of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in vivo are attributable to the peculiar interaction with dendritic cells. The high prevalence of tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells in cDC might result from the combination of long-term survival of <italic>S.</italic> Tm in this cell type (but not in other monocytic phagocytes and granulocytes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Tam1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Rydstrom1">[50]</xref>) and the slow growth of the pathogen within these cells in vivo. Formally, we cannot exclude that cDC might also “select” for slow-growing, tolerant <italic>S.</italic> Tm cells. Anyhow, upon ciprofloxacin exposure, this bacterial subpopulation survives and might even benefit from the antibiotic-inflicted reduction of the overall tissue burden. Future work will have to identify the host cellular features and the bacterial responses establishing tolerance. This will be of importance as such cells can cause relapses after the end of an antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>The presence of ciprofloxacin-tolerant cells in gut mucosa, the cecal patch, the cLN, and the spleen may suggest that relapses can be “seeded” from various reservoirs. The site of reseeding may affect the relapsing disease progression. This will be a challenging topic for future work, as site specificity of the “seeding” step is difficult to establish, at least by end point assays as used in our current study. It is interesting to note that cell transfer into the peritoneal cavity of the recipient mouse led to seeding of the spleen and the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, no (or few) bacteria were detected in the cLN or the gut lumen of the recipient mice within 4 d. This is consistent with the route of drainage of the peritoneal cavity, which should initially seed the spleen and the liver, while gut lumen and the gut draining mesenteric lymph nodes would represent sites of subsequent dissemination at later stages of the relapse.</p>
<p>Finally, our data establish that persistent bacteria are not invulnerable. Triggering of innate immune responses can decimate the loads of persistent <italic>S.</italic> Tm in the cLNs of antibiotic-treated mice. The TLR4 mixed bone marrow chimeras indicated that this may occur via indirect, paracrine signals. Clearly, more work is required to establish the underlying cellular mechanisms. Furthermore, as Toll-like receptor agonists may evoke significant unwanted side effects, alternative strategies for inducing innate immune responses should be explored. CpG-based drugs are presently tested in clinical trials for cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Guha1">[51]</xref>. This may foster future work optimizing the augmentation of antibiotic treatment by PRR ligands and may lead to novel antibacterial therapies with increased in vivo efficacy.</p>

<title>Mathematical Modeling and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The inoculum in our infection experiments contained a minority population consisting of seven distinct WITS. Measuring the population sizes of each WITS in the cLN reveals the stochasticity that is inherent in the colonization dynamics but is “averaged out” in measurements of the majority population. By revealing the stochasticity, WITS allow us to disentangle dynamical parameters that could not be estimated individually. In a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref> we showed that a minority population of WITS in the inoculum allows us to disentangle immigration and net replication rates. Here, we can exploit the stochasticity to separate replication and clearance rates in the cLN during antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p>There are many potential ways of using the complex experimental data we generated for mathematical modeling. We chose to use only the WITS data to estimate the rates of replication and clearance. We also have measurements of the total bacterial population size in the cLN, which were determined independently from the population sizes of the WITS. Although we could have used the data on the total bacterial population size to further refine our parameter estimates, we decided to use them to validate our model fit instead (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The consistency between experimental data and model prediction corroborates our parameter estimates for replication and clearance rates under antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p>Mathematically, we describe the colonization of the cLN by <italic>S.</italic> Tm by a stochastic birth-death-immigration model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Karlin1">[62]</xref> see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>). Let <italic>L</italic> be a random number that denotes the number of a unique WITS in the cLN. In the model, WITS are assumed to migrate from the cecum to the draining lymph node at a rate <italic>μ</italic>, replicate in the lymph node at a rate <italic>rL</italic>, and be cleared at a rate <italic>cL</italic>. All these processes are assumed to be stochastic. The transition probabilities of our model are then given by the following equations:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001793.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001793.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>A diagram showing the processes incorporated into our model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001793-g004">Figure 4A</xref>.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>, we derived a likelihood function and used it to estimate parameters of our model for cLN colonization within the first day after intragastric infection. We estimated that during the first day, 298 bacterial cells enter the cLN, and that the bacterial population grows at a rate of 2.82 per day (corresponding to a population doubling time of 5.9 h; no ciprofloxacin applied during this period).</p>
<p>To estimate replication and clearance parameters during antibiotic treatment, we combined the above estimates (characterizing the early colonization dynamics) with new experiments. In these experiments, mice were infected with mixed inocula containing seven uniquely tagged <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup>. Treatment was started 1 d after infection and maintained until day 3, 5, or 10. Because treatment kills almost all bacteria in the gut, we set <italic>μ</italic> = 0—that is, we assume that, once treatment has started, the influx of bacteria into the cLN is negligible. As a useful side effect of having only two parameters to estimate, we do not face any problem of identifiability as for the early colonization parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>. As treatment starts 1 d after inoculation, the cLN is not empty but contains approximately 1,000 bacterial cells. To derive a likelihood function, we therefore need to calculate the probability generating function for arbitrary distributions of initial bacterial population sizes. (In contrast, for the derivation of the likelihood function for early colonization, we could assume an empty cLN.) For the general initial condition <italic>f</italic>(<italic>s</italic>, <italic>t</italic> = 0) = <italic>g</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) that describes an arbitrary distribution of initial bacterial population sizes, the probability generating function is:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001793.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001793.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>We first estimated replication and clearance rates from the WITS data sampled at day 3 after infection. We denoted these rates as <italic>r</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub>3</sub>, respectively. We assume that the number of WITS in the cLN at day 1 after infection is distributed according to the probability distribution:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001793.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001793.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Hereby, the parameters <italic>μ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>, and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> characterize the dynamics from day 0 to day 1 after inoculation without antibiotic treatment. This assumption leads to better estimates than assuming a fixed bacterial population size in the cLN 1 d after inoculation.</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001793.e002">Equation (1)</xref> with <italic>g</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) = <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>s</italic>), we can determine the probability generating function under treatment. Unfortunately, the state probabilities <italic>p<sub>k</sub></italic>, which are needed for likelihood-based inference of the model parameters, cannot be determined in closed form. This is in contrast to the scenario considered in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>, in which the process started with an empty cLN. We therefore calculated the state probabilities numerically using Fourier transformation of the characteristic function. The characteristic function can be obtained from a probability generating function by substituting <italic>e<sup>iθ</sup></italic> for the dummy variable <italic>s</italic>. The state probabilities <italic>p<sub>k</sub></italic> are related to the characteristic function as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001793.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We can invert this relation and calculate the state probabilities <italic>p<sub>k</sub></italic> using the normalized discrete inverse Fourier transform (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Alexander1">[63]</xref>):<disp-formula id="pbio.1001793.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001793.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>The parameter <italic> N</italic> should be a large number. The larger <italic> N</italic><sub>,</sub> the more accurate the state probabilities. In our implementation, we have chosen <italic> N</italic> = 2<sup>14</sup>. With these values, the likelihood and maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters reach a relative accuracy of 10<sup>−8</sup>. To obtain maximum likelihood estimates from the state probabilities <italic>p<sub>k</sub></italic>, we followed the same procedure as in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-Kaiser1">[40]</xref>. The resulting estimates for <italic>r</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub>3</sub> constitute averages of the replication and clearance rate over the period from day 1–3.</p>
<p>We follow an analogous procedure to obtain parameter estimates for the average replication and clearance rates over the periods day 3–5 and day 5–10 from the experimental enumeration of the <italic>S.</italic> Tm<sup>WITS</sup> at days 5 and 10, respectively. To that end, we set <italic>g</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001793.e002">Equation (1)</xref> to the probability generating function describing the state of the system at the end of the preceding period.

<p>All the probability-generating functions and likelihoods described here were implemented in the R language of statistical computing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001793-R1">[64]</xref>.
