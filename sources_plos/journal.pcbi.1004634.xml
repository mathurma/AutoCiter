<abstract>
<p>Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms which regulate cellular processes such as vesicular trafficking has been enabled by conventional biochemical and microscopy techniques. However, these methods often obscure the heterogeneity of the cellular environment, thus precluding a quantitative assessment of the molecular interactions regulating these processes. Herein, we present Molecular Interactions in Super Resolution (MIiSR) software which provides quantitative analysis tools for use with super-resolution images. MIiSR combines multiple tools for analyzing intermolecular interactions, molecular clustering and image segmentation. These tools enable quantification, in the native environment of the cell, of molecular interactions and the formation of higher-order molecular complexes. The capabilities and limitations of these analytical tools are demonstrated using both modeled data and examples derived from the vesicular trafficking system, thereby providing an established and validated experimental workflow capable of quantitatively assessing molecular interactions and molecular complex formation within the heterogeneous environment of the cell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The regulation of many biological processes requires exquisite control over the formation of multimolecular complexes in specific regions of the cell. For example, the endocytosis, transport and exocytosis phases of vesicular trafficking require the coordination of multiple regulatory proteins, signaling lipids and second messengers on the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and multiple other vesicular structures (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref009">9</xref>]). Importantly, in these systems a single protein can evoke different responses depending on its subcellular localization and the interacting partners present in a particular cellular niche. This complexity is well illustrated by the Phosphofurin Acidic Cluster Sorting Protein 2 (PACS-2) which regulates ER-mitochondria traffic through interactions with BAP31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref010">10</xref>], cytosol-to-mitochondria and cytosol-to-lysosome translocation of apoptotic effectors through interactions with Bid, Bim and Bax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref011">11</xref>], induces cell cycle arrest through interacting with nuclear-localized SIRT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref012">12</xref>], and is even targeted by pathogens such as HIV to misdirect MHC I endocytosed from the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref013">13</xref>]. Adding further complexity is the requirement that these proteins be scaffolded into high-order structures such as receptor complexes, coated pits and membrane microdomains to mediate their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref017">17</xref>]. While this building of molecularly unique complexes enables a small number of regulatory proteins to coordinate a vast and heterogeneous vesicular trafficking system, the commonly employed molecular and biochemical approaches used to identify and characterize these complexes obscures the heterogeneity that provides specificity to these cellular systems. For example, the <italic>en bulk</italic> nature of biochemical assays such as immunoprecipitation do not preserve the heterogeneity and subcellular localization of these systems, while conventional microscopy-based assays suffer from limited spatial resolution (typically 250–350 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref018">18</xref>]). Indeed, many tools have been developed to overcome these limitations of optical microscopy, including Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref020">20</xref>]. While these technologies have provided an increased understanding of the unique molecular complexes that regulate cellular processes such as vesicular trafficking, they typically involve energy transfer between two fluorophores, or reconstitution of fluorophore halves, and thus are usually limited to assessing interactions between two protein species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref021">21</xref>], can suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios (FRET, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref022">22</xref>]) and may alter protein interaction dynamics through irreversible cross-linking (BiFC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref023">23</xref>]). Super-resolution microscopy avoids these issues by directly imaging fluorophores with high precision, with the number of molecular interactions that can be measured limited only by the number of available fluorescent channels.</p>
<p>The advent of super-resolution microscopy systems has enabled the direct visualization of individual molecular complexes with high precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref025">25</xref>], with improvements in resolution achieved by one of two strategies. The first strategy uses patterned excitation light that confines fluorophore excitation to sub-resolution regions (e.g. STimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref027">27</xref>]) and Saturated Structured Illumination Microscopy (SSIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref028">28</xref>])). The second strategy relies on the stochastic switching of fluorophores between dark and fluoresce states at low densities, followed by localization of each individual fluorophore by mapping a Gaussian function to each fluorophore’s point-spread function (e.g. Photoactivation Localization Microscopy (PALM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref031">31</xref>]) and Ground State Depletion Microscopy (GSDM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref032">32</xref>]). Although the stochastic techniques generally provide higher lateral (<italic>xy</italic>) resolution (20–30 nm, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref033">33</xref>]) than do structured illumination methods (50–80 nm, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref028">28</xref>]), both methods provide sufficient resolution to quantify intermolecular interactions. Recent advances such as the use of astigmatic lenses have provided similar improvements in axial (<italic>z</italic>) resolution (50–60 nm), allowing quantification to be extended into three dimensions. Several of these methods can be deployed using widely available laser-based Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopes and free software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref034">34</xref>], allowing super-resolution microscopy to be easily and inexpensively implemented in many existing microscopy facilities. Although a powerful tool, super-resolution microscopy lacks a standardized set of validated quantitative tools for assessing intermolecular interactions equivalent to the commonly employed colocalization and morphological methods available to conventional microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref035">35</xref>]. Indeed, many analytical techniques developed for conventional microscopy produce erroneous results if applied to super-resolution images, due both to super-resolution images with pixels smaller than the size of many of the complexes being imaged–leading to interacting molecules being resolved in neighboring (non-colocalizing) pixels–and due to the stochastic nature of super-resolution imaging which can lead simultaneously to both missed fluorophore detections (undersampling) and repeat detection of fluorophores (oversampling) within the same sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>To address these limitations we have developed Molecular Interactions in Super-Resolution (MIiSR), a validated set of software tools for quantifying intermolecular interactions and the formation of higher-order molecular complexes in super-resolution images. MIiSR overcomes the issues associated with applying conventional colocalization and morphological analyses to super-resolution images through the use of spatial statistical approaches which elucidate the presence of intermolecular interactions and the presence of large molecular assemblies through quantification of the spatial relationship between labeled molecules. By taking a statistical approach, MIiSR provides precise quantitative data from super-resolution images, even given the issues of oversampling, undersampling, and differential sampling between channels, and allows these analyses to be applied to the molecular position files produced by most super-resolution imaging systems.</p>

<title>Design &amp; Implementation</title>
<p>MIiSR is comprised of a set of analytical functions and two graphical user interfaces (GUI’s) written in the Matlab mathematical language (S1 –MIiSR Program). The input required by MIiSR are molecular position files produced by many super-resolution microscopy systems. MIiSR natively supports positions files from Leica GSD-SR Ground-State Depletion microscopes, Zeiss ELYRA PS1 dSTORM microscopes, and any microscope running QuickPALM software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref034">34</xref>]. In addition, the import of multiple formats of tab-delineated positions files is also supported, allowing for import from many other super-resolution microscopy systems. Best analysis practices require data files containing the X/Y/Z coordinates of the detected molecules, as well as the number of photons collected or precision of detection, for each detected molecule–although data lacking Z coordinates and/or photon/precision data can be analyzed. To install, decompress the MIiSR.zip file and add the resulting “MIiSR” folder to the path file in Matlab.</p>
<p>The first GUI, run using the command ‘MIiSRconvert’, enables the batch conversion of microscope position files to Matlab-compatible.mat files in a standardized format (X coordinate, Y coordinate, Z coordinate, # Photons, Precision of detection, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Files can be added to the conversion queue individually, by folder, or by folder and all sub-folders. Options are available to scale molecular positions from pixels to nm, to scale intensity to number of detected photons, to filter out poorly resolved fluorophores based on fluorophore intensity or the precision of detection, and to optimize processing speed. The integrity of the molecule position data is maintained through applying these scaling factors in a linear fashion to all data points in the position file. Once processing has been started all files in the queue will be converted, with converted files saved in the same folder as the original position file. MIiSRconvert acts as a GUI for the function fileConv.m, which can operate independently of the GUI, enabling its use in user-written Matlab functions and scripts.</p>

<p>The second GUI, run using the command ‘MIiSR’, is the primary interface for analysis of super-resolution images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This GUI acts as a wrapper for functions which combine color (image) channels and provide image cropping (LoadCrop.m), filter out molecules located in low-density regions in order to enhance analysis of clustered molecules (densityFilter.m), quantify intermolecular interactions (SAA2col.m and SAA3col.m), quantify molecular clustering (spatialStats.m), and segment molecular clusters within super-resolution images (DBSCAN.m, OPTICS.m and hierOPTICS.m). These functions can operate independently of the GUI, allowing for their incorporation into user-written functions and scripts. The general workflow for MIiSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) is to load one to three color channels, which will generate a preview image, and using this preview, to select a Region Of Interest (ROI) to analyze. Once an ROI is set, the user configures the analyses they wish to perform, and then adds the ROI and its attendant analysis options to the queue. The user then has four options–the analysis conditions for the current ROI can be changed and the new analysis scheme saved as a new entry in the queue, a new ROI and analysis scheme can be selected from the existing image and added to the queue, a new image can be loaded and ROIs and analysis schemes from the new image added to the queue, and lastly, the queue can be processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). During processing a folder will be generated for each entry in the queue, located in the same folder as the position file for the first (red) color channel. The data, graphs and images generated for each ROI will be saved in this folder.</p>
<p>While the analysis routines provided in the MIiSR GUI represent a series of well-validated and powerful analytical tools, alternative methods to perform similar analyses have been published previously. To provide a comprehensive set of tools, we have included functions for Owen <italic>et al’s</italic>. density-based method of cluster identification (Hsegment.m) and Sengupta <italic>et al’s</italic> pair correlation based analysis of cluster composition (RDFquant.m) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref039">39</xref>]. These command-line functions perform these analysis on the molecular position files produced by the MIiSR GUI, and can be run as either stand-alone functions or can be incorporated into user-written scripts and functions. All functions provided in the MIiSR package are extensively documented through the use of in-function comments, enabling users to modify each function as needed.</p>

<title>Detection of Inter-protein Interactions with Spatial Association Analysis</title>
<p>Detecting intermolecular interactions, in the context of their subcellular localization, is the aim of many biochemical fractionation and imaging methods. Super-resolution imaging offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate intermolecular interactions, as many super resolution microscopy methods can detect fluorophores with a lateral resolution of ~20 nm, which is sufficiently accurate to enable a statistical assessment of intermolecular distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref033">33</xref>]. By comparing distances between the molecule of interest and its nearest neighbor(s) in the other imaging channels, statistical evidence of inter-molecular interactions can be established. Indeed, we have previously used this nearest-neighbor approach to establish that tetraspanin’s scaffold the formation of molecularly distinct CD36-integrin complexes, an observation that was obscured by conventional imaging and biochemical assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref040">40</xref>]. This toolbox includes a more powerful form of this Spatial Association Assay (SAA), which begins with a conventional nearest-neighbor approach wherein the Euclidian distance from each molecule in one color channel of the image to its nearest neighbor(s) in the other color channel(s) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), but rather than defining intermolecular interactions as those occurring below an arbitrarily selected threshold, SAA instead introduces a statistically robust detection of intermolecular interactions by defining potentially interacting molecules as those separated by distances below the Colocalization Distance Criterion (CDC). The fraction of interactions is then compared to a randomized image to determine if the observed degree of interaction is above those predicted of non-interacting samples, thus determining if the observed interactions are real or due to chance juxtaposition of molecules in the image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The CDC is defined by two factors, the precision of fluorophore detection, and by any chromatic registration defects in the microscope’s optical path. The precision of localization of each detected molecule in an image is usually provided in the position files produced by super-resolution microscopes, while any registration errors must be measured directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref041">41</xref>], but are generally negligible in most commercial super-resolution microscopy systems. The CDC is defined as the root-mean-squared error of the sum of mean precision across color channels (σ<sub>RMS</sub>), multiplied by a 90% or 95% probability cutoff (1.65 or 2 standard deviations), with any image registration (I<sub>reg</sub>) error added to this product:</p>

<p>Thus the CDC represents a statistically defined maximum separation distance between interacting molecules in a super-resolution image after sampling precision and chromatic aberration are taken into account (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s006">S1 Text</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref042">42</xref>]). For 2-color images most microscopes will have a CDC of 23–28 nm, the exact value of which is determined by the numerical aperture and magnification of the objective lens, and the brightness and number of fluorophores detected in each color channel; for 3-color images the CDC is larger, due to the increased degree of error incurred by measuring across an additional color channel, with typical values ranging from 28 to 35 nm. It is important to note that SAA analysis is highly sensitive to the area selected for analysis; ROIs which extend past the boarders of the cell, or which include unlabeled structures that have displaced the labeled molecules within the ROI, can lead to over-estimation of the degree of molecular interactions during the randomization process–specifically, leading to the randomization of molecular positions over a larger area/volume than that truly occupied by the imaged molecules. To limit this error, the user should ensure that all ROIs used for SAA analyses fall within the boundaries of the cell and lack any obvious voids. In addition, MIiSR includes the option to estimate the true area occupied by the labeled molecules, through refining the user-selected ROI to a minimum bounding polygon encompassing all points in the original ROI. Proper selection of ROIs, along with this automated refinement of the randomization area, will ensure accurate quantification of molecular interactions in super-resolution images.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the efficacy of SAA analysis we generated 30-mer complementary and non-complementary DNA oligos 5’ tagged with either Cy3 or Cy5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Annealed complementary oligos create Cy3/Cy5 pairs separated by 10.2 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref043">43</xref>], while the non-complementary oligos distribute randomly. As expected, MIiSR analysis of 1:1 mixtures of non-complementary oligos found no significant association, and displayed a distribution of intermolecular distances identical to that measured in randomized images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast, there was a marked increase in intermolecular separations below the CDC in a 1:1 mixture of complementary oligos, with the mode of the distribution curve falling close to the predicted 10.2 nm separation of the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Indeed, measurement of intermolecular distances of Cy3/Cy5 labeled complementary DNA oligos ranging from 20 bp to 60 bp (estimated lengths of 6.8 to 20.4 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref043">43</xref>]), determined that the mode of the SAA plot accurately measured the predicted intermolecular distances, and could provide an accurate measure of intermolecular distances as small as one-third the precision of the super-resolution microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). It is important to note that the calculation of interactions by SAA is non-symmetrical, meaning that the degree of association observed between molecule A and molecule B will be different from that measured between B and A. This is illustrated when complementary Cy3 and Cy5 labeled oligos are mixed such that there is excess Cy5-labeled oligo, leading to a mixture containing annealed Cy3-Cy5 oligos and non-annealed Cy5 oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). As all Cy3 oligos are bound to a Cy5 oligo, the SAA interaction observed between Cy3 and Cy5 remains constant, whereas increasing the portion of unannealed Cy5 oligo decreased the measured interaction of the Cy5 oligo with the Cy3 oligo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). MIiSR automatically calculates SAA along all lines of symmetry, providing a full assessment of molecular interactions within an image. In theory, the statistical approach taken in SAA analysis should render it insensitive to modest over- and under-sampling. To test this we imaged complementary Cy3 and Cy5 oligos and then modified the data sets to mimic over- and under-sampling. Modest oversampling had a minimal impact on the observed degree of colocalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), whereas under-sampling reduced the measured degree of colocalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Importantly, however, undersampling did not change the measured colocalization when normalized to the colocalization observed in randomized images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), indicating that image randomization can be used to normalize for differing degrees of sampling. It is important to note that because of oversampling it is not practical to use SAA analysis to quantify homeotypic interactions as it is extremely difficult to differentiate between the repeated detection of the same fluorophore versus detection of multiple fluorophores within an area less than the CDC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). Moreover, extreme oversampling can lead to randomized images where the mean intermolecular separation is less than the CDC. For highly oversampled images, MIiSR includes the option to analyze a randomly selected subset of the molecules in the image, a method demonstrated previously to provide accurate quantification of intermolecular interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref040">40</xref>].</p>

<p>To demonstrate the utility of SAA analysis in a biologically relevant system we used MIiSR to analyze interactions with the HIV protein Nef, which modulates the trafficking regulators PACS-1 and AP-1 in order to alter membrane trafficking in a manner advantageous to HIV immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref044">44</xref>]. Using cells expressing GFP-Nef, mCherry-PACS-1 and Alexa-647 immunolabled Golgin 97, we used GSDM to image the interaction of Nef with PACS-1 and the Golgi, and then analyzed these images using 3-color SAA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). This analysis revealed that the majority of Nef is complexed with PACS-1, with a third of the Nef-PACS-1 complexes localized to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The small portion of non-PACS-1 associated Nef was split between Golgi and non-Golgi compartments, and importantly, all of these interactions were significantly different from the degree of association predicted for non-interacting molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, SRP). By fixing and imaging cells at different time points, SAA analysis can be applied to the study of temporal changes in protein-protein interactions. Indeed, we found that HIV Nef decreases its interaction with the trafficking regulator PACS-1 as time increases after HIV protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>), consistent with the shift of Nef’s function from altering endocytosis to altering Golgi export over this time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref045">45</xref>]. Clearly, MIiSR can provide insight into intermolecular interactions not otherwise detectable by conventional biochemical and microscopy techniques.</p>

<title>Quantifying Molecular Clustering</title>
<p>While SAA quantification provides insights into intermolecular interactions, it does not provide information on the formation of higher-order molecular structures such as protein islands, lipid microdomains, vesicles, or other large molecular assemblies. These higher-order structures are critical in many biological systems, for example, comprising the 90 nm diameter endocytic clathrin-coated pits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref017">17</xref>]. Indeed, GSDM imaging of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor after stimulation with 10 μM isoproterenol shows a visually apparent increase in co-clustering with β-arrestin-1 and clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), consistent with our previous studies showing this receptor to be internalized via a β-arrestin-1/clathrin-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref047">47</xref>]. While formation of <italic>de novo</italic> interactions of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor with β-arrestin-1 and clathrin can be identified by SAA, the delivery of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor to clathrin-coated pits by β-arrestin-1 is best assessed using clustering assays. Quantification of molecular clustering is implemented in MIiSR using spatial statistics, specifically the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) and Ripley’s K statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref050">50</xref>].

<p>RDF, also known as the pair-correlation function and G-function, was developed nearly 50 years ago for the assessment of atomic and molecular distributions in physical and chemical systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref051">51</xref>], and more recently has been applied to super-resolution images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref048">48</xref>]. RDF quantifies the density of molecules as a function of distance (r) to other molecules in the same color channel (self-clustering), or in a second (co-clustering), color channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s002">S2A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s006">S1 Text</xref>). RDF analysis will accurately illustrate the presence of multiple cluster sizes and inter-cluster distance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), and the relative degree of clustering is indicated by the height of the peaks corresponding to the molecular clusters. An alternative approach proposed by Ripley in 1977, termed the K function, quantifies the number of molecules as a function of distance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s003">S3A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s006">S1 Text</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref052">52</xref>]). The K function is typically normalized to distance and density, producing the H function. Ripley’s H function, plotted against intermolecular distance (r), produces an inverted parabola-like curve with a single peak. The value of r corresponding to this peak (r<sub>max</sub>) correlates roughly with mean cluster size, while the height of this peak correlates to the degree of clustering in the sample. It is important to note that the value of r<sub>max</sub> is impacted by the distance between neighboring clusters, and thus is not a direct indicator of mean cluster size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref053">53</xref>]. Several approaches are available to calculate an accurate mean cluster radius from H-plots; Lagache <italic>et al</italic>, determined that average cluster radius could be approximated by r<sub>max</sub>/1.3 in biological systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref053">53</xref>], whereas Kiskowski <italic>et al</italic>, determined that the mean cluster radius was equal to one-half the radius where the derivative of the H(r) plot [H’(r)] crosses -1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref050">50</xref>]. MIiSR calculates both H(r) and H’(r), allowing the user to use either method to determine mean cluster radius. The difference between Ripley’s H-function and RDF analysis is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s007">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s009">S3 Videos</xref>, which respectively compare: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s007">S1 Video</xref>) the co-clustering of two randomly distributed molecular species, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s008">S2 Video</xref>) co-clustering of a randomly distributed population of molecules with a pre-clustered population of molecules, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s009">S3 Video</xref>) the impact of increasing ratios of unclustered to clustered molecules on these analyses. Of note, RDF analysis is better able to identify weak co-clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s007">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s008">S2</xref> Videos), and retains its ability to identify clusters in the presence of a large number of unclustered molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s009">S3 Video</xref>). In contrast, Ripley’s analysis provides a single clear peak indicative of mean cluster size, whereas RDF produces a more complex, multipeaked curve, indicative of sub-populations of differently sized clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s007">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s009">S3 Videos</xref>).</p>
<p>The utility of these tools in MIiSR is demonstrated by analyzing the sequential formation of a macromolecular endocytic complex formed by the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor, its endocytic regulator β-arrestin-1, and clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Following stimulation with isoproterenol the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor associates with β-arrestin-1, which subsequently delivers the β-adrenergic receptor to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref055">55</xref>]. RDF analysis revealed that unstimulated β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor is minimally clustered with β-arrestin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), with this weak clustering indicated in Ripley’s analysis as an upward curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). As expected, stimulation with isoproterenol results in a rapid co-clustering of the β-adrenergic receptor with β-arrestin-1 that increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). In contrast, no significant clustering of the β-adrenergic receptor is observed with clathrin prior to, or in the first minute following, isoproterenol stimulation, with significant co-clustering between the β-adrenergic receptor and clathrin observed only at 5 minutes post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4A, 4D and 4E</xref>). Interestingly, the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor clusters start off as small clusters (~40 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, 1 minute arrow) and then coalesced into larger structures at 5 minutes (~90 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, 5 minute arrow). These larger clusters overlap, and are of the same size (90 nm) as, the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor/clathrin clusters observed at the same time point (5 minute arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>), and closely match the reported size of clathrin coated pits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>While these are powerful tools for quantifying clustering, careful sample preparation and imaging acquisition are required to minimize artifacts in both RDF and Ripley’s analysis. It is critical to employ labeling methods which minimize labeling-induced clustering. Indeed, significant antibody-induced oligomerization of CD81 was observed when samples were labeled using full-length primary and secondary antibodies, whereas replacing either the primary or secondary antibody with Fab fragments reduced CD81 oligomerization to that observed when a monomeric primary labeled Fab was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). In addition, while MIiSR allows for quantification of self-clustering using both Ripley’s and RDF analyses, great caution needs to be taken when interpreting these results as oversampling caused by the repeat detection of the same fluorophores can create an artefact of intense self-clustering, in which case the apparent cluster size will equal the precision of the Gaussian mapping algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s002">S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s003">S3B</xref> Figs). As a result, analysis of self-clustering remains difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref038">38</xref>], although alternate methods such as Sengupta <italic>et al</italic>.<italic>’s</italic> method for quantifying cluster composition in RDF plots can provide some indication of self-clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref015">15</xref>]. This function is provided as ‘RDFquant.m’ in the MIiSR package. A final consideration is image acquisition, specifically the degree of under- or over-sampling in the analyzed images. In contrast to measurements of self-clustering, neither over- or under-sampling have a significant impact on cross-RDF analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). In contrast, cross-Ripley’s analysis is sensitive to both oversampling and undersampling, with undersampling leading to underestimation of clustering, and oversampling leading to smaller measured cluster size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s003">S3C–S3F Fig</xref>). As such, it is important that Ripley’s analysis be performed on a sample containing the smallest possible degree of over- and under-sampling. At this time there are no widely accepted methods for determining the ideal degree of sampling for quantitative super-resolution imaging, and as such we would recommend that both RDF and Ripley’s analysis be performed in parallel. Alternatively, we have determined that it is possible to define a reasonable stop-point in the image reconstruction process at which reconstructed image achieves the best balance between undersampling and oversampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s003">S3D–S3F Fig</xref>). By performing a Pearson’s autocorrelation as the super-resolution image is reconstructed it is possible to determine the point where the adding additional frames to the image reconstruction process ceases to add additional information to the resulting super-resolution image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). Autocorrelation increases rapidly early during image reconstruction as new fluorophores are added to the image, but will asymptotically approach 1 later in the reconstruction process as new fluorophore detections decrease and repeat detections increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). Ripley’s analysis of a modeled super-resolution acquisitions incorporating both over- and under-sampling demonstrates that the measured H(r) values most closely match the true H(r) values when super-resolution image reconstruction is restricted to the portion of the acquisition where the autocorrelation R value is ≤ 0.990 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s003">S3F Fig</xref>). Unfortunately, not all super-resolution systems provide positions files compatible with this form of image reconstruction, and as such this reconstruction method could not be included in MIiSR.</p>

<title>Identifying Molecular Clusters</title>
<p>While the RDF and Ripley’s functions provide a quantitative measure of the degree of molecule clustering in an image, they do not allow for easy segmentation of individual clusters within the image. A previous approach, which calculates Ripley’s H function at a static value of r followed by thresholding of the resulting image, has been successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref039">39</xref>], and is provided in MIiSR as Hsegment.m. However, the resulting cluster map is highly dependent on the value of r and the threshold value selected by the user. As such, MIiSR also includes the cluster-identification algorithms <italic>Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise</italic> (DBSCAN, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref057">57</xref>]) and <italic>Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure</italic> (OPTICS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref059">59</xref>]), which are unbiased image segmentation tools for identifying molecular clusters. To demonstrate the utility and limitations of these tools they were applied to the analysis of Alzheimer’s-disease associated Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in lysosomes. APP may be processed into pathological forms of β-amyloid in lysosomes, with subsequent exocytosis depositing APP in the brain, thus forming the pathological β-amyloid plaques typical of Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref065">65</xref>]. The mechanism of APP release into the extracellular environment is not clear, but our earlier studies suggest that multi-vesicular body (MVB) exocytosis may be a key route of APP secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref066">66</xref>]. GSDM imaging was used to identify immunolabeled APP and the lysosomal network through identifying clusters of the late endosome/lysosomal marker LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). DBSCAN and OPTICS analysis in MIiSR were then applied to assess the localization of APP within the late endosome/lysosome network.</p>

<p>DBSCAN is an algorithmic approach to identifying clustered molecules in which a molecule is considered part of a cluster if it has a sufficient number of neighboring molecules within a defined area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1 Text</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref067">67</xref>]). Unlike many clustering algorithms, DBSCAN can identify core versus edge molecules within a cluster, but is limited in that the user must choose appropriate values for neighborhood size (ε) and minimum number of molecules per cluster (<italic>k</italic>). Indeed, the values selected for these variables are critical, as inappropriate values can lead to over- or under-estimation of cluster composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Applied properly, DBSCAN allowed for the identification of APP clusters with only minimal errors, but was unable to identify LAMP1 clusters due to the more heterogeneous nature of LAMP1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Regions of interest were defined using the edge molecules for each APP cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g005">Fig 5C</xref>); and the density of LAMP1 within these ROIs was then quantified, demonstrating that 52.8% ± 9.7% of LAMP1 colocalized with APP clusters. Moreover, comparing the size of APP clusters to the density of LAMP1 within individual clusters revealed that large APP vesicles were LAMP1-positive, while smaller APP vesicles had minimal amounts of LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Combined, these results suggest that APP traffics through at least two different components of the endomembrane system–a LAMP1-negative compartment comprised of small vesicles, and a LAMP1-positive (lysosomal) compartment comprised of larger vesicles. Although DBSCAN was able to identify APP clusters and enabled some analysis of the distribution of APP relative to LAMP1, its inability to segment the more heterogeneous LAMP1 staining precluded analysis of APP within the lysosomal network. Indeed, this limitation of DBSCAN with super-resolution images has been noted previously, and extensive alteration of the algorithm was required to overcome these limitations, perhaps explaining why this otherwise simple algorithm has not been more widely adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>OPTICS overcomes many of the limitations of DBSCAN and requires that the user specify only the minimum number of molecules per cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref059">59</xref>]. Despite this, to our knowledge OPTICS analysis has not yet been employed in super-resolution images. Rather than defining clusters as regions of sufficiently high density, OPTICS instead measures the local density around each molecule and plots this density as a reachability distance (RD) plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s001">S1 Text</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s004">S4C–S4E Fig</xref>). Clusters appear as “valleys” in the resulting RD plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), with cluster identification performed visually or via automated methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref068">68</xref>]. When cluster density is consistent across an image a static RD value can be used to extract clusters, with clusters defined as “valleys” of points between peaks that exceed the RD cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, APP). Static RD values do not work for cluster identification in images containing clusters of varying molecular density, as the RD value of the “valleys” is a product of a clusters molecular density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, LAMP1). MIiSR includes a modified version of the cluster identification method developed by Sander <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s006">S1 Text</xref>, hierOPTICS.m, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref068">68</xref>]) for identifying clusters in a heterogeneous population. Instead of relying on a static RD value, this method instead identifies clusters by hierarchically segmenting the RD plot at “peaks” in the plot; the plot is recursively segmented, starting with the highest peak in each segment, until a resulting segment (cluster) either contains fewer than a user-defined number of molecules, or has a mean RD value that is not sufficiently different from the peak RD value to be considered a separate feature (LAMP1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s006">S1 Text</xref>). This method allows for identification of clusters of varying density (and thus varying RD values), for example, enabling identification of the LAMP1 clusters that could not be detected using DBSCAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g005">Fig 5B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This hierarchal breakdown of the RD plot also enabled identification of complex structures, for example, sub-clusters of LAMP1 within larger LAMP1 bodies–structures reminiscent of MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Indeed, this analysis identified numerous small LAMP1 structures 40–80 nm in diameter, the expected size of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref070">70</xref>]) organized into larger structures, 200–500 nm in diameter, consistent with the expected size of MVB’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref070">70</xref>]). When applied to APP, OPTICS analysis identified a similar pattern to DBSCAN, with ~60% of APP found in LAMP1 colocalizing clusters 250–800 nm in diameter, and the remainder of APP concentrated in small LAMP1-negative bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Interestingly, the bulk of LAMP1-associated APP was found in MVB-like bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Comparison of APP density within larger MVB-like bodies and their constituent ILV-like bodies revealed no difference in the density of APP, suggesting that APP is most likely in the lumen of MVBs and not within the lumen of ILVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g006">Fig 6E</xref>).</p>

<p>While beyond the scope of this article, many other analyses are possible on clusters identified by either DBSCAN or OPTICS including morphological analyses or generation of 3D cell models with super-resolution precision using volumetric rendering of the edges and vertices exported by MIiSR. As with RDF and Ripley’s analysis, the repeat identification of fluorophores combined with the precision of the detection algorithm tends to create the appearance of self-clustering. As such, care must be taken to exclude any clusters near or below the precision of the microscope when performing DBSCAN or OPTICS analysis.</p>

<title>Combining Methods for Detailed Molecular Analysis</title>
<p>In the preceeding sections we have demonstrated individual capabilities of MIiSR using examples drawn from various intracellular trafficking processes. Each method provided quantification of a single aspect of molecular interactions or higher-order structuring. However, by using MIiSR to apply a combination of these methods to a single image, a highly detailed view of the structure and organization of a molecular system can be revealed. Moreover, these quantitative image analysis tools can be combined with other readouts of molecular function, such as the identification of active signaling complexes with BiFC, to further delineate the functional aspects of a molecular system. For example, the HIV-1 protein Nef modulates vesicular trafficking in order to promote HIV survival by preventing HIV antigen bearing MHC I from remaining on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref044">44</xref>]. While Nef can form homodimers, no labeling reagents exist which selectively labels dimerized Nef; rather, this conformation can be identified using BiFC-tagged Nef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref071">71</xref>]. In this assay two Nef fusion proteins, consisting of Nef fused to either the C or N terminal fragment of Venus, were co-expressed in cells; upon Nef dimerization these non-fluorescent fluorophore fragments can reconstitute a functional Venus which can then be imaged using super-resolution microscopy. Using GSDM we quantified the localization of dimerized Nef relative to the Golgi transport regulator TGN46. Mander’s colocalization analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref072">72</xref>] of a conventional microscopy image indicated that there that was ~80% overlap between TGN46 and Nef-BiFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). However, it is unclear if this reflects a true interaction between subsets of dimerized Nef and TGN46 or if this is due to the low spatial resolution of conventional microscopy. GSDM imaging of the same sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, ~20 nm resolution) clearly identifies a number of large Nef-BiFC and TGN46 structures with no apparent overlap, as well as a number of smaller structures which contain both Nef-BiFC and TGN46. SAA analysis of the GSDM image reveals that approximately 30% of Nef-BiFC does in fact associate with TGN46, with this association occurring in a region consistent with inter-protein interactions (~12 nm separation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7C and 7E</xref>), and that this degree of association is far greater than that predicted by random chance alone. This indicates that this is a <italic>bona fide</italic> interaction between Nef-BiFC and the Golgi, although the extent of this interaction is far smaller than previously predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref071">71</xref>] or indicated by conventional microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In marked contrast, TGN46 shows a much smaller degree of overlap with dimerized Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7D</xref>); indeed, there is less TGN46 interacting with Nef-BiFC than would be predicted by random chance alone, indicating a net exclusion of Nef-BiFC from TGN46-containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). How can this apparent disagreement in the molecular association of Nef-BiFC and TGN46 be explained?</p>

<p>Ripley’s H function analysis provides the first clue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7F</xref>), displaying a curvature typical of a heterogeneous distribution of molecules which may contain a mixture of co-clustered and unclustered sub-populations of Nef-BiFC and TGN46. OPTICS segmentation of the Nef-BiFC image, followed by quantification of the quantity of TGN46 in each Nef-BiFC cluster, revealed significant co-clustering of TGN46 and Nef-BiFC in small vesicles corresponding to the predicted size of Golgi-derived intracellular transport vesicles (20–60 nm, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref073">73</xref>]), while larger Nef-BiFC containing vesicles were negative for TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). This clustering data resolved the apparent disagreement in Nef-TGN46 interactions identified by SAA analysis–the small vesicles containing co-clustered Nef-BiFC and TGN46 contained ~30% of the total Nef-BiFC and ~2% of the total TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7H</xref>), indicating that these small vesicles represented the primary site of Nef-TGN46 interactions. While these vesicles incorporated a large portion of the total cellular Nef-BiFC, they contained only a minute portion of the total cellular TGN46. Interestingly, not only did the larger Nef-BiFC containing vesicles completely exclude TGN46, but they were also closely apposed to the TGN–sufficiently closely opposed as to overlap with the TGN in conventional microscopy images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), thus potentially representing a previously undescribed Nef-targeted cellular niche. Thus, by applying these analytical tools to super resolution images we have identified, for the first time, a Golgi-proximal cellular niche in which dimerized Nef is sequestered.</p>
<p>Clearly, application of multiple analytical methods in MIiSR provides insight into intermolecular interactions, and the location of these interactions within the cellular environment, that are not detectable by other biochemical and imaging techniques. Applied to a single image, MIiSR can extract a wealth of data regarding intermolecular interactions and the formation of higher-order molecular complexes within a cell, providing a molecular view of biological systems not available through conventional imaging or biochemical methodologies.</p>

<title>Fixation and Immunostaining</title>
<p>Cells were washed once with PBS and then fixed for 20 min using 4% PFA in PBS at 20°C. Cells were blocked and permeabilized with PBS + 5% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 to 60 minutes. Permeabilization was employed even if fluorescent transgenes had been expressed or cell-surface staining was performed, in order to ensure access of the GSD imaging media to all fluorophores in the sample. Primary antibodies (1:200 anti-LAMP1, 1:5,000 anti-HA, 1:5,000 anti-FLAG, 1:200 anti-AP-1γ, 1:200 anti-TGN46) were then added in PBS + 5% BSA and incubated for 20 minutes (extracellular antigens) or 90 minutes (intracellular antigens). Samples were washed 3 x 15 min in PBS and dylight-488, Cy3 or dylight-647 conjugated secondary Fab’s added at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS + 5% BSA for 1 hour. Samples were washed 3 x 15 min with PBS, subjected to a 15 min secondary fixation using 2% PFA in PBS, washed 1 x 5 min in PBS, and then stored at 4°C until imaged. Immediately before imaging the samples were mounted in freshly prepared imaging media (PBS plus 100 mM cysteamine), which is required to protect the triplet (dark) state fluorophores from oxidation (photobleaching) during GSDM imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref029">29</xref>]. The coverslips were then mounted on a 75 μl depression slide containing filled with imaging media and the coverslip-covered depression sealed using either the water-compatible rapid-curing silicone sealant Twinsil, or heat-set VALAP (1:1:1 by weight mixture of Vaseline (petroleum jelly), Lanolin and Paraffin). Samples were imaged within 4 hours of mounting.</p>

<title>Ground State Depletion Microscopy (GSDM)</title>
<p>All super-resolution images were acquired using GSDM. Mounted samples were placed on the stage of a Leica SR GSD microscope equipped with a TIRF-compatible 100×/1.43 NA objective lens plus an addition 1.6× optical magnifier for a total of 160× magnification, 125 mw–250 mW imaging lasers (488, 555 and 647 nm) and a 30 mW backpumping laser (405 nm). Individual color channels were imaged sequentially starting with the longest wavelength dyes. For each channel the sample was subjected to a depletion period in which the sample was excited at maximum laser intensity until less than 120 active fluorophores were present in each image. Excitation intensity was then reduced to ~20% and the sample imaged at 100 fps for 5,000–30,000 frames with backpumping laser intensity increased over the imaging period in order to maintain 50–120 active fluorophores per frame. The resulting molecule position files were exported as either TIFFs with 20 μm pixels or as ASCII-formatted molecule position files for subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Monte Carlo Modeling of Unclustered Molecules</title>
<p>For many analyses the degree of colocalization or clustering needs to be compared to the degree of colocalization or clustering of an equivalent number of molecules, distributed over the same area, but in which molecules are non-interacting. Computationally-derived samples mimicking this situation were produced by randomizing molecule positions from GSDM images. First, the area of the image is determined by extracting the minimum and maximum <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic> coordinates from the molecule position files. Next, the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic> coordinates of the original molecules are replaced with random coordinates, generated using a uniformly distributed random number generator, falling within the bounds of the original image. This produces images of non-interacting (e.g. randomly distributed) molecules that contain the same number of labeled molecules distributed over the same area, as the original image. These randomized images were then analyzed using the relevant MIiSR tool.</p>

<title>Creation of Monomeric Fluorophore Fields</title>
<p>To test the SAA analysis fields of molecules with defined degrees of interactions were required. Briefly, several complementary and non-complementary DNA oligomers of varying lengths, designed to eliminate any secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004634.ref074">74</xref>] were purchased with either 5’ Cy3 or 5’ Cy5 labels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004634.t001">Table 1</xref>). The Cy3 labeled DNA oligomer was then mixed with varying ratios of either the complementary or non-complementary Cy5 labeled oligo at 50 nM concentration and annealed in a thermocyler by heating to 95°C for 30 sec followed by cooling to 4°C for 5 min. The oligos were then diluted 1:100,000 in distilled water and absorbed onto an acid-cleaned cover slip for 30 min at room temperature. When a 1:1 ratio of Cy3-to-Cy5 fluorophores was used this produced a uniform field of fluorophores, with fluorophores in the same channel separated by ~60 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004634.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To confirm monomeric distributions were being generated, these oligos diluted an additional 1:10,000 were coated onto coverslips, generating uniform fields of fluorophores which were individually resolvable by conventional microscopy. Intensity profiling and step-wise photobleaching assays of these cover slips demonstrated that the vast majority (&gt;98%) of fluorophores were monodispersed. In subsequent GSDM imaging the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores were respectively detected 5.7 ± 2.1 and 3.2 ± 1.8 times, with 87.3% ± 6.9% of the Cy3 and 91.1 ± 12.7% of the Cy5 fluorophores detected in the pre-GSDM imaged sample recovered during GSDM imaging.</p>

<p>For DNA oligo analysis, differing ratios of complementary and non-complementary DNA oligos were GSDM imaged as described above, or GSDM imaging was performed on Golgin-97 immunostained CD4+ HeLa cells ectopically expressing Nef-GFP and mCherry-PACS-1. SAA was conducted on the resulting 2-color (DNA oligo) and 3-color (Nef/PACS-1/Golgin97) images using SAA2col.m and SAA3col.m respectively. To model undersampling, individual Cy3 and Cy5 molecules were deleted from the DNA oligo data sets by randomly deleting, using a uniform random number generator, individual Cy3 or Cy5 molecules in a particle position file. To ensure any repeat detections of these fluorophores were also eliminated, all detected molecules falling within the same color channel and within a radius equal to the CDC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004634.s006">S1 Text</xref>), of these molecules were also removed from the dataset. To model oversampling, individual Cy3 and Cy5 molecules were randomly selected, using a uniform random number generator, the particles duplicated in the dataset after computationally resampling their position within the diameter of the CDC (21.27 nm). Both the oversampled and undersampled data sets were then analyzed using SAA2col.m.

<title>Modeling—Image Acquisition Modeling</title>
<p>Modeling of changes in image autocorrelation and Ripley’s H-function during image acquisition was performed by first generating synthetic images 5,000 x 5,000 nm in size, containing 200 clusters of 100 ± 10 fluorophores with radii of 75 ± 37.5 nm; to this image 10% noise (non-clustered molecules) was added. Random positioning of clusters, cluster size and positioning of molecules within each cluster, were achieved using a linear random number generator. Cluster centers were generated as a series of random x/y coordinates. The number of molecules in each cluster was then determined by subtracting a random integer between 0 and 20 from the largest allowed cluster size, and the cluster radius determined by subtracting a randomly generated number between 0–75 from the maximum cluster radius. Molecules were then randomly placed inside of the cluster by generating a random angle and radius, and using those values to position the molecule relative to the clusters’ center point. To model undersampling, this “true” image was compared to a copy wherein 10% of fluorophores were randomly deleted. This undersampled image was then “imaged” (sampled) 10,000 times, with 10–20 randomly selected fluorophores “active” in each image. The 20 nm precision of our super-resolution microscope was modeled by randomly generating a shift in the molecular position using a normally-distributed random number generator with a full-width-at-half maximum of 0.5 the precision of the microscope (10 nm). This combination of undersampling and virtual imaging fully recapitulates the over- and under-sampling typical of super-resolution acquisitions. Autocorrelation was quantified by reconstructing the super-resolution image 50 frames at a time, and comparing Pearson’s correlation of the current image versus the image reconstructed 50 frames previously. At select intervals the reconstructed image was exported and cross-Ripley’s H Function performed using the non-undersampled image as the second color channel.</p>

<title>Modeling–Ripley’s and RDF Analysis</title>
<p>Pre-clustered molecules were added to these models as described above, except that 50 clusters of 50 nm radius, containing 100 molecules, were generated. In all models, clusters were static (non-animated) structures. For models containing one or two species of moving molecules, the starting x and y coordinates for each moving molecule was generated using a linear random number generator. Each moving molecule was then assigned to the nearest cluster and the end point positioned within the cluster using a randomly generated angle and radius, as described above. For models quantifying the impact of increasing clustering, the moving molecules where then animated over 200 frames, during which each molecule was moved linearly closer to its end-point. To model the impact of increasing portions of unclustered molecules, co-clustered molecules were generated as above, and 2% additional unclustered molecules added to each frame over 200 frames. Once generated, all frames from each video were analyzed using the spatialStatistics.m function in MIiSR.</p>

<p>(A) Spatial association analysis functions by assessing distances between the molecule of interest (blue circles) and the nearest-neighbour molecule in the other colour channel (red circles). The intermolecular separation distances between nearest neighbours is calculated for all molecules in the primary (blue) channel, and the resulting measurements plotted as a histogram (“Measured” in histogram). The positions of the molecules in the second channel are then randomized (light-red molecules) and the measurement repeated (“Randomized” in histogram). Intermolecular interactions are indicated by an enrichment of neighbouring molecular pairs with small nearest-neighbor separation distances.

<p>(A) RDF (pair-correlation or G(r)) analysis operates by quantifying the number of molecules (blue points) in an expanding torus centered on each molecule, normalized to the average density of molecules in the sample. For an unclustered dataset, G will have a value of 1 at all radii (Unclustered). For datasets with regularly spaced clusters, the mean cluster radius is indicated by the distance between the graph origin and the first peak in the data (<italic>w</italic>, top graph), with the distance between clusters indicated by the distance between subsequent peaks (<italic>m</italic>, top graph). Biological samples, which rarely have regularly spaced clusters, generally display only the first peak, allowing for assessment of mean cluster size (<italic>w</italic>, bottom graph).

<title>Ripley’s K-function–Operation and effect of over- and under-sampling.</title>
<p>(A) Ripley’s K function operates by quantifying the density of particles (blue points) in an expanding circular area around each point, compared to the number of points predicted given the average point density of the image. When K is plotted against radius, clustering appears as higher-than predicted K values at small radii, and lower-than expected values at larger radii (Clustered versus unclustered, top graph). The H-derivative (bottom graph) improves cluster detection by normalizing the value of K to both area and radius. Unclustered molecules will have an H value of zero for all radii, while clustered data will produced peaked data, where the average cluster radius is indicated by the peak of the graph (arrow) and the average separation distance is indicate as two times the radius at which the H(r) plot re-crosses the zero line. (B) Modeled negative effects of over-sampling in single-channel Ripley’s H-function analysis, generated by computationally re-sampling images to add repeat fluorophore detections.

<title>Operation of the DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithms.</title>
<p>(A) The DBSCAN algorithm requires the user to provide the minimum number of particles in a cluster (<italic>k</italic>) and the neighbourhood size in which a cluster would exist (ε). Assuming <italic>k</italic> = 5, molecule ‘<italic>a</italic>’ (green) would be considered <italic>directly density reachable</italic>, and thus a core molecule in a cluster, as more than 5 particles are found within its ε-neighborhood (green circle). Molecule ‘<italic>b</italic>’ (orange) would be considered <italic>density reachable</italic>, and thus an edge point, as it falls within the ε-neighbourhood of a core molecule (A), but does not contain 5 neighbours within its ε-neighborhood. Molecule ‘<italic>c</italic>’ (blue) is not density-reachable from any particle at this value of ε, and therefore would be considered non-clustered. (B) DBSCAN-mediated clustering of modeled data using varying values of <italic>k</italic> and ε. Because DBSCAN uses static values of ε and <italic>k</italic> to determine density, it has difficulty separating clusters of differing density (green) or separating noise surrounding clusters with densities &gt; ε (red). (C) The OPTICS algorithm measures the local neighborhood density by ordering the molecules in the dataset by proximity, and then measuring two quantities for each molecule. The first is the <italic>core-distance</italic>, defined as the distance from the current molecule to the <italic>k</italic><sup>th</sup> closest molecule, where <italic>k</italic> is a user-selected minimum cluster size (left panels, molecules <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>). Secondly, the distance from the current molecule to the next molecule in the list (molecules <italic>1</italic>–<italic>5</italic>, right panel) is measured. The larger of these two values is then kept as the <italic>Reachability Distance</italic> (RD). D) Reachability plot of the same data set shown in panel B generated using OPTICS with <italic>k</italic> = 15. Clusters appear as “valleys” separated by “peaks” in the RD plot.
