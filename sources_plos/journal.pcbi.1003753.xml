<abstract>
<p>A spatially-explicit, stochastic model is developed for Bahia bark scaling, a threat to citrus production in north-eastern Brazil, and is used to assess epidemiological principles underlying the cost-effectiveness of disease control strategies. The model is fitted via Markov chain Monte Carlo with data augmentation to snapshots of disease spread derived from a previously-reported multi-year experiment. Goodness-of-fit tests strongly supported the fit of the model, even though the detailed etiology of the disease is unknown and was not explicitly included in the model. Key epidemiological parameters including the infection rate, incubation period and scale of dispersal are estimated from the spread data. This allows us to scale-up the experimental results to predict the effect of the level of initial inoculum on disease progression in a typically-sized citrus grove. The efficacies of two cultural control measures are assessed: altering the spacing of host plants, and roguing symptomatic trees. Reducing planting density can slow disease spread significantly if the distance between hosts is sufficiently large. However, low density groves have fewer plants per hectare. The optimum density of productive plants is therefore recovered at an intermediate host spacing. Roguing, even when detection of symptomatic plants is imperfect, can lead to very effective control. However, scouting for disease symptoms incurs a cost. We use the model to balance the cost of scouting against the number of plants lost to disease, and show how to determine a roguing schedule that optimises profit. The trade-offs underlying the two optima we identify—the optimal host spacing and the optimal roguing schedule—are applicable to many pathosystems. Our work demonstrates how a carefully parameterised mathematical model can be used to find these optima. It also illustrates how mathematical models can be used in even this most challenging of situations in which the underlying epidemiology is ill-understood.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We consider how mathematical models can be used to inform the control of plant disease, even when the identity and biology of the pathogen are not well understood. This is often the case: control of emerging epidemics is most likely to have a significant effect when epidemics remain small, but little may then be known. We analyse data from an experimental plot concerning spread of Bahia bark scaling of citrus, an economically-important disease in north-eastern Brazil, by fitting a mathematical model, which also accounts for uncertainty, to disease spread. Our model captures the epidemiological features of the disease, revealing that transmission is localised and that disease spreads relatively slowly. We use the model to investigate fundamental trade-offs underlying cultural disease control at scales relevant to citrus production. We show how optimal planting densities can be defined, which balance slower spread of disease against the profit that would be lost by growing fewer plants. We also show how the cost of looking for and removing symptomatically diseased plants can be balanced against the reduced disease it leads to. Ours is the first study to consider how a parameterised mathematical model can be used to design optimised cultural controls of plant disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mathematical models of plant disease can be used to screen and assess control strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Fishman1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Sisterson1">[10]</xref>. Although work on plants is not subject to the ethical concerns that hamper experimentation targeting pathogens of animal or human hosts, mathematical modelling nevertheless becomes particularly compelling for plant diseases when logistic constraints mean that experimentation would be costly or difficult. This situation is exemplified by diseases caused by pathogens with epidemiology necessitating long experiments to yield useful data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Sgrillo1">[13]</xref>, pathogens causing symptoms that are difficult to detect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Fischer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-AntonioliLuizon1">[15]</xref>, pathogens with epidemiology that is ill-understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-AlRwahnih1">[17]</xref>, and/or pathogens that would require experimental trials in the vicinity of susceptible commercial growing operations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-SantosFilho1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Martins1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we develop a model of Bahia bark scaling of citrus (BBSC) on grapefruit, a pathosystem subject to each of these logistical constraints. BSSC has been endemic to north-eastern Brazil since the 1960s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira3">[20]</xref>, but its etiology remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Nickel1">[21]</xref>. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo with data augmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Gibson1">[22]</xref> to fit a spatially-explicit, stochastic, epidemiological model to a data-set charting the spread of BBSC through a small experimental grove. We go on to alter the host topology and parameters in this model to use it to assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of control at the scale of a typical grove as used in citrus production in Brazil. As little is known of the putative BBSC pathogen, and even less about any potential vector, it is difficult to reliably estimate the efficacy of any chemical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Hall1">[23]</xref> or biological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Cunniffe2">[24]</xref> control. We therefore concentrate on cultural strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Howard1">[25]</xref>, and focus on the effectiveness of reducing the density of planting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Burdon1">[26]</xref> and of roguing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Sisterson1">[10]</xref> (i.e. searching for and removing infected plants).</p>
<p>The spread of plant pathogens is typically localised, and so it is intuitive that the progression of disease through a host population will be affected by planting density. Direct as well as indirect effects of host density on disease incidence have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Burdon1">[26]</xref>, and lower host densities are almost always associated with lower levels of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Huang1">[27]</xref>. Indeed the “dilution effect” caused by increased distances between pairs of hosts has been suggested to underlie the success of crop mixtures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Chin1">[28]</xref> and intercropping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Vandermeer1">[29]</xref>, although other more complex mechanisms are thought to be involved in both cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Mundt1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Trenbath1">[33]</xref>. However, there are very few models specfically targeting the effect of host density on disease spread. Despite work concentrating on how percolation thresholds can be related to the distance between pairs of nearest neighbours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Bailey1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Otten1">[35]</xref>, tests of that theory have largely been restricted to small-scale model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Neri1">[36]</xref>, and application to real pathosystems remains in its infancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Leclerc1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Poggi1">[38]</xref>. Percolation is also only strictly relevant to systems where spread is restricted to nearest neighbour transmission, although this does map well to the soil-borne pathogens that are the focus of that work. Other work has concentrated on how host density affects invasion thresholds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Thrall1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Brown1">[40]</xref>, but does not provide a clear prescription for how to optimise host densities when disease is able to invade. While there have also been studies showing how the landscape-scale dynamics of disease are conditioned on the configuration and availability of patches of suitable habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-DeWoody1">[41]</xref>, or fields planted with susceptible varieties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Skelsey1">[42]</xref>, that work offers little at scales relevant to individual farmers or growers.</p>
<p>Roguing is commonly used for systemic diseases of high-value or perennial crops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dasgupta1">[43]</xref>, particularly when labour is cheap compared with the cost of chemicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Gibson2">[44]</xref>, or for pathogens which cannot be effectively controlled by chemical means <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-SantosFilho1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Martins1">[19]</xref>. Viral pathogens for which roguing is practised include cassava mosaic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Fauquet1">[45]</xref>, bunchy top of banana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Allen1">[46]</xref>, cocao swollen shoot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-DzahiniObiatey1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Thresh1">[48]</xref>, citrus tristeza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Barnier1">[49]</xref>, plum pox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dallot1">[50]</xref> and sweet potato chlorotic stunt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Gibson3">[51]</xref>, although roguing is also used for bacterial pathogens (e.g. almond leaf scorch, caused by <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Sisterson2">[52]</xref>), and for fungal diseases (e.g. lettuce drop, caused by <italic>Sclerotinia minor</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Patterson1">[53]</xref>). The only constraint is that pathogens must cause symptoms that can be detected, either by visual inspection or by diagnostic testing. Roguing has been included in non-spatial mathematical models for a number of years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Fishman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Chan1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Fishman2">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-vandenBosch1">[55]</xref>, and more recent work has embedded control by roguing in spatial models of pathogen spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Sisterson1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dybiec1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dybiec3">[58]</xref>, although realistic parameterisation of pathogen dispersal is less common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Cook1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Parnell2">[8]</xref>. Typically these later models have also considered culling, in which all hosts within a particular distance of a symptomatic focal host are removed at the time of control. Some of these models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dybiec2">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dybiec3">[58]</xref> have explicitly included economics, although the focus has been the cost of treatment (i.e. the cost of removal of diseased host plants). For perennial hosts that are not replanted, however, the cost of detection may, in fact, be more important, since an individual host can be removed at most once, but may be examined for symptoms any number of times. The only model to include detection costs used optimal control theory to show rigorously how to balance the costs of detection and control within a fixed budget <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-NdeffoMbah1">[59]</xref>, but the mathematical complexity of this procedure necessarily restricted attention to a non-spatial, deterministic model. There are no examples of a model-based approach that optimises the economic aspects of roguing including the cost of detection via a model parameterised to spread data.</p>
<p>We have taken advantage of the availability of experimental data for model fitting to frame our analyses specifically in terms of the dynamics and control of BBSC. However, the controls we examine are widely used, and the techniques we use in our modelling and fitting are applicable to a large number of pathosystems. We therefore prefer to think of the BBSC system as a data-driven case study that provides an opportunity to address the following more general questions.</p>

<title>Bahia bark scaling of citrus</title>
<p>BBSC affects most citrus species and varieties, but is especially severe on grapefruits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Roistacher1">[60]</xref>. Symptoms appear similar to Citrus Psorosis A, and include darkening and thickening of the bark leading to scaling lesions on the trunk and branches, dieback of young branches, and significant gum extrusion. However leaf symptoms on inoculated indicator plants, together with histopathological and molecular studies, indicate BBSC is a distinct disease. The study of Laranjeira <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira3">[20]</xref> resulted in the only published data focusing on BBSC spread (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003753.s002">Text S1</xref>). It demonstrated that the disease is polyetic and naturally transmitted. The speed of disease spread and the pattern of dispersal appear consistent with an insect vector of limited dispersion ability. However the identity of this putative vector is unclear, as is the identity of the pathogen itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Nickel1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>BBSC currently remains restricted to two states in the Brazilian north east, Bahia and Sergipe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Nickel1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Barbosa1">[61]</xref>. Since dispersal is thought to be localised, the principal risk of an epidemic arising elsewhere in Brazil is likely to occur by transplanting infectious plants. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of BBSC by inadvertent transplantation is certainly possible: Santos <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Santos1">[62]</xref> have described BBSC symptoms in plants used for budwood in Bahia, Brazil. There is therefore a need to understand whether and how a spatially-isolated epidemic could be effectively controlled. This must be done even though our biological understanding of the epidemiology of BBSC remains limited.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Epidemiological model</title>
<p>We use a spatially-explicit, stochastic, compartmental SEIR model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Gilligan1">[4]</xref> to represent BBSC dynamics at the scale of a grapefruit grove. Individual host plants are categorised by disease status: (S)usceptible hosts are uninfected; (E)xposed hosts are latently infected, and so are neither symptomatic nor infectious; (I)nfected hosts are both infectious and symptomatic; and (R)emoved hosts have been removed by control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g001">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The E to I transition occurs at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, corresponding to average latent period <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003753.s001">Table S1</xref>). Since infectious hosts are always symptomatic in our model, the average incubation period is also <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Infected hosts do not appear to suffer increased mortality due to BBSC infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira3">[20]</xref>, and so in the absence of control the rate of transition from the I to R compartment is fixed at zero. However, if control by roguing is included in the model, the removal rate is set by how frequently and efficiently infected plants are detected and removed, with rounds of detection and removal according to a schedule that is fixed in advance. Since we work over a twenty year timescale, similar to the typical productive lifespan of an individual citrus host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-DeNegri1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Pagliuca1">[64]</xref>, we do not attempt to model natural death. We also do not consider replanting of any plants removed by roguing, since this is not common in the Brazilian citrus industry, perhaps due to growers' perception that replanting removed hosts would lead to a heterogeneous grove that would be more difficult to cultivate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-DeNegri1">[63]</xref>.</p>

<title>Host topology</title>
<p>The host landscape comprises a central grove and the adjoining ten rows/columns of the eight neighbouring groves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g001">Figure 1(c)</xref>). The central grove contains 1680 trees, arranged in 14 rows of 120, at spacing 6 m<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>4 m.

Spacings between individual trees and between pairs of groves reflect standard cultivation citrus patterns in Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-DeNegri1">[63]</xref>. We focus on the disease status of trees within the central grove, and although underlying pathogen dynamics are identical over the entire landscape, only the central grove is subject to any control. Since we include hosts in neighbouring groves, our model incorporates both secondary infection within the central grove, and infection due to the surrounding groves becoming infected and then re-exporting inoculum into the central grove (i.e. primary infection from the point of view of the target). This force of primary infection on the central grove varies over time, as the density of infection in neighbouring groves changes.</p>

<p>Initial infection is assumed to occur via transplantation into the central grove, planting one or more immature infected plants at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at random positions.

Disease progress was assessed by detailed visual inspection at three monthly intervals for the first five years of the experiment, followed by additional more irregular surveys for two years thereafter. The data consist of the visible disease status of each grapefruit plant in the experimental grove at each survey time; i.e. a series of maps showing which hosts were susceptible and which were (visibly) infected on each survey.

We define the number of asymptomatic plants at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Planting density</title>
<p>To test the effect of host density on disease dynamics, the within-row and between-row spacing of trees were altered, while constraining the total number of trees in the central grove to remain fixed at 1680. The ratio of horizontal to vertical separation was held fixed at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> throughout.

<p>While this approach illustrates the effect of inter-host distance on disease spread, it is an oversimplification, since fixing the number of trees at different planting densities corresponds to groves with different areas. To examine the trade-off between disease prevention and productivity we therefore considered the density of asymptomatic trees at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> years in the central grove as a function of host density, again for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>The dispersal scale parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was estimated to have median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with 95% credible interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Our estimate of the median average dispersal distance of BBSC is therefore <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The 95% interval for the rate of infection, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since the dispersal kernel at distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003753.e030">Equation 4</xref>), the average force of infection on a single susceptible plant in the default typical grapefruit grove from a neighbouring single infected plant in the same column is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This corresponds to an average time until infection of about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Of course this estimate does not account for the fact that a single infected has more than one neighbour, that there is more than one route of infection apart from nearest neighbour spread, and that there will almost always be more than one infectious plant. Nevertheless, it does indicate that the progression of BBSC in the typical citrus grove we consider is likely to be relatively slow.</p>
<p>The 95% credible interval for the rate of emergence of symptoms, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This corresponds to an average incubation period of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since symptomatic plants are infectious in our model, this also corresponds to our estimate of the pathogen's latent period. The delay before the pathogen could spread, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, had 95% interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Pairwise posterior distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g003">Figure 3</xref>) reveal a strong negative correlation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This was expected: if hosts become infectious more quickly, the rate of infection does not need to be so large to lead to the same amount of disease spread.

<title>Disease progress without control</title>
<p>Although the disease initially spreads rather slowly, almost all plants within a typical grove are expected to become symptomatic within 20 years when the initial level of infection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g001">Figure 1(b)</xref>).

Spatial snapshots from an arbitrarily chosen run of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g001">Figure 1(c)</xref>) indicate that disease spread is very localised, with infection apparently being transmitted largely (but not exclusively) between neighbouring pairs of plants. It also appears to be rather difficult for the pathogen to escape the central grove and to infect plants in the surrounding groves, although this does happen occasionally. Snapshots from other runs indicate that these aspects of BBSC dynamics are general for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; spread is localised with separate foci of infection that grow and coalesce over time, and spread is also largely restricted to the central grove, at least for the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> years.

<title>Optimising the planting density</title>
<p>The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends strongly on the planting density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4(b)</xref>), with low host density leading to very little spread and so high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (again with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). However at more realistic planting densities the spread is much more devastating. On average only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of plants escape (visible) disease by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> years at the density of the typical grove <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> plants per hectare).</p>
<p>This behaviour leads to a disease-driven trade-off in the number of productive plants per hectare. Low planting density can give excellent disease control, with very high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but of course also implies fewer plants per hectare. The optimum density of productive plants is therefore recovered at an intermediate host spacing: for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, this was at a planting density of around 200 plants per hectare, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per hectare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4(c)</xref>). This qualitative result is robust to the initial level of infection, and there was an optimum planting density for all values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we considered. However both the optimal planting density, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per hectare at this planting density, decreased as the initial level of infection was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4(d)</xref>), although these responses begin to flatten off for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We also considered the response of the yield (cf. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003753.e085">Equation 6</xref>) to the planting density. Again for a given level of initial infection, a planting density that leads to an optimum yield per hectare can be defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4(e)</xref>), although the density that optimises yield when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> plants per hectare) is larger than that required to maximise the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> plants per hectare, as described above). The response was also differently shaped, with the yield per hectare remaining at a non-zero value for even very large planting densities (compare 4(c) with 4(e)). This is because even at high densities the epidemic does not infect the entire central grove within the first few years of the epidemic, and so the yield is then non-zero (see also the inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4(e)</xref>, which shows the yield before normalisation of to fixed grove area). However, the response of the optimum planting density required to optimise yield per hectare for different values of the initial level of infection, and the response of the optimum yield per hectare itself at optimum planting density to the initial level of infection both follow a similar pattern to the responses for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4(d)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4(f)</xref>).</p>

<p>Even at relatively high initial levels of infection, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, roguing can lead to excellent disease control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g005">Figure 5(a)</xref>). At <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (a level at which every plant within the central grove would become infected without control within 20 years), even the rather long roguing interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would save approximately 20% of plants from visible symptoms at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is shortened, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of course increases. Values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> months lead to high levels of disease control (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>%), and even <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> gives <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in fact always depends on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in this broad fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g005">Figure 5(c)</xref>), decreasing as either parameter is increased. For short roguing intervals, however, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was relatively irresponsive to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and indeed there was a large set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pairs for which excellent control was achieved. This was despite the more restricted range of pairs of these parameters for which the pathogen was reliably eradicated from both the central and the surrounding groves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g005">Figure 5(d)</xref>).</p>
<p>We also examined the response of the median value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to changes in the roguing interval, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the probabilty of detection, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g005">Figure 5(e)</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the impact of the epidemic is increased as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is increased or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is decreased. In fact the shape of the contours of constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e234" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be explained by a simple calculation. If the other epidemiological parameters are fixed, the efficacy of roguing is set by the effective infectious period of the average host. This is the time for which the host is infectious, i.e. the time between the emergence of infectivity after the latent period has passed and later removal of the host by roguing. If the probability of detection is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e235" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then the number of surveys required to detect a host after the emergence of symptoms upon it is a geometric random variable, with average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e236" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A particular symptomatic plant could have become infectious at any time between the final round of surveying when it was asymptomatic/uninfectious and subsequent round by which time it was symptomatic. If we assume the time of the transition between states <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e237" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e238" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in our model is uniformly distributed between surveys (i.e. if we ignore any knock on effect from the slight increase in the rate of infection between rounds of detection that would occur because the number of infected plants increases between surveys), then the average effective infectious period can be approximated by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003753.e239"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e239" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used Markov chain Monte Carlo with data augmentation to fit a spatially-explicit, stochastic, epidemiological model to the spread of BBSC, and have estimated a number of key epidemiological parameters. Dispersal was exponential, with median approximately 5 m (similar to the distance between neighbouring pairs of plants in a typical citrus grove in Brazil). Laranjeira <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira3">[20]</xref> suggest that the BBSC pathogen may be transmitted by an air-borne vector of limited dispersion ability, and our results are consistent with that possibility. Our estimate of the dispersal scale, together with a careful review of the dispersion ability of arthropods detected in the Bahia region, may help to narrow the set of candidate vectors. Certainly a number of mites and scale insects are known to transmit viral diseases, both in citrus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Bassanezi1">[74]</xref> and other perennials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Oro1">[75]</xref>, and similar species would be an obvious place to begin such a search. Our parameter estimates are also consistent with an association between a bark wounding insect and a splash dispersed fungus.</p>
<p>To obtain an adequate fit to the experimental data we included a delay for plants to reach epidemiological maturity before being able to spread and/or show symptoms of the disease in our model. While it is of course rather difficult to give a mechanistic interpretation of this delay because of the uncertainities surrounding BBSC etiology, it could, for example, correspond to a need for mature tissues for symptom expression, or a bark borer insect vector that only feeds on mature bark. Irrespective of its mechanistic basis, our estimate of the delay is approximately 24 months. Laranjeira <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira3">[20]</xref> took the long delay before disease began to spread in the experiment as indicative of the incubation period for the pathogen that causes BBSC, which we instead estimated to be approximately 6 months. Given the very good statistical support for our model fitting, we contend that our new interpretation of the experimental results is more plausible, especially since a two year incubation period is rather long for a vectored disease.</p>
<p>In a grove at planting density typical of citrus production in Brazil, we predict that BBSC would spread slowly. This was unsurprising given the relatively slow rate of disease spread in the original experiment, in which the density of host plants was approximately six times higher than found in citrus production. Nevertheless, and slow spread notwithstanding, we predict BBSC would easily spread throughout an entire grove within 20 years, even for modest levels of initial infection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e273" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In turn this indicates that careful sanitation of new plantings for BBSC symptoms is important. Despite the official programs to foster propagative plants under screenhouses in Bahia, symptomatic “mother” plants are still found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Santos1">[62]</xref>, and most nurseries are not kept under screenhouses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Laranjeira4">[76]</xref>. This clearly presents a risk, particularly since there is no diagnostic test to identify asymptomatic infected plants. This compelled us to investigate other types of control apart from sanitation. We note that, although high BBSC severity and incidence can be routinely detected in mature commercial groves in Bahia, the incidence of disease is usually quite low at the time of first detection (HP Santos-Filho, personal communication). The particular range <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e274" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we used was therefore intended to account for the full range of values that may occur in practice, given groves at different distances from sources of inoculum and/or with different levels of sanitation before planting. The influence of the initial level of infection on the optima we identify indicates that, for practical implementation, it would be advantageous to perform further experimentation and/or further data-collection to enable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be more precisely quantified.</p>
<p>We therefore used our model to examine the effect of host spacing on disease spread. As the density of hosts was increased, so did the level of disease, which of course was expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Burdon1">[26]</xref>. However this is particularly unfortunate given recent trends toward higher planting densities in commercial citrus production in Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Stuchi1">[77]</xref>. We therefore examined the trade-off between host density and productivity in the presence of disease by considering the density of plants that escape infection over a 20 year timescale as the host spacing was altered. We found an optimum planting density, at which the reduction in productivity due to planting fewer hosts per hectare was offset by the reduced losses to disease (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g003">Figure 3(c)</xref>). Although the exact nature of this optimum depended on the initial level of infection, optimal densities were typically sufficiently low that there would be enough space for an intercrop to be established. This approach is already used in Brazil, where growers sometimes plant passion fruit or pineapple between rows of citrus. However, since the intercrop would undoubtedly have its own effect(s) on pathogen dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Boudreau1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Trenbath1">[33]</xref>, investigating the epidemiological consequences of intercropping requires more data.</p>
<p>According to our simulation results, roguing, even when detection is imperfect, can control disease successfully (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Control can be achieved for relatively long roguing intervals, even for high levels of initial infection. Indeed in our scans showing the effect of roguing interval on control efficacy we used a default value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (rather than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as used in assessing the effect of host density) in order to obtain a more meaningful response as the parameters of interest were changed. This good level of control was possible because of the slow rate of BBSC spread and its limited dispersal ability. Control by roguing is also aided by the absence of cryptic infection (i.e. hosts that are able to infect without showing symptoms). This contrasts with a number of other pathogens of citrus, for example <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic>, the bacterium that causes citrus canker, for which there is both significant long-range dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Gottwald1">[78]</xref> and cryptic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Cook1">[6]</xref>. Indeed the recent attempt to eradicate citrus canker from Florida involved removing any host plant within 579.1 m (1900 ft) of a detected symptomatic focal plant, irrespective of apparent disease status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Gottwald2">[79]</xref>. However, the epidemiology of BBSC indicates that a similar approach is not required here, and initial tests of this type of control strategy indicated that it did not noticably outperform simple roguing (data not shown).</p>
<p>Control was possible even though roguing only occurred within the central grove. It did not require the pathogen to be entirely eradicated from the system, and indeed for high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the pathogen was eradicated only rarely (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g005">Figure 5(d)</xref>), presumably because there was at least one escape of the pathogen from the central grove before it was effectively controlled there. This surprisingly high level of control despite an ever-increasing external reservoir reflects the low probability of the pathogen returning to the central grove once it has escaped (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g001">Figure 1(c)</xref>), and on the occasions it does return, frequent roguing limits its impact. Ultimatately this derives again from the limited disperal ability of the pathogen that causes BBSC. For pathogens capable of faster and/or long-distance dispersal, synchronisation in control is acknowledged to be extremely important, since otherwise the pathogen is able to persist, bulk-up and repeatedly cause devastating reinvasion from uncontrolled areas that act as refugia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Sisterson1">[10]</xref>. Following common practice in the Brazilian citrus industry, removed plants were not replaced in our model, which again facilitated control. Replanting removed trees results in a constant supply of new susceptible hosts to areas with infection, which necessarily makes control more difficult.</p>
<p>The efficacy of roguing was characterised by considering <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e279" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the average effective infectious period (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003753.e239">Equation 10</xref>), and this quantity was an excellent predictor of the number of plants that escape disease (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g005">Figure 5(e)</xref>). Investigating how this result generalises to pathogens that are harder to control would be an interesting extension, particularly because the approximation used in the calculation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e280" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is most accurate for pathogens that spread slowly. We note that, although simple, the principle underlying the calculation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e281" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has been reported incorrectly in previous studies that used non-spatial, compartmental models. Parameter values given in Table 2 of Jeger <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Jeger1">[3]</xref> (see also Madden <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Madden1">[80]</xref>) indicate that if roguing is performed monthly then the equivalent removal rate would be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e282" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This assumes that symptoms and infectivity are developed immediately after rounds of surveys, and so that the average infectious period is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e283" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Given the more accurate estimate of 15 days, the rate of removal for monthly surveys with perfect detection should in fact be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003753.e284" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>By introducing a simple measure of the profitability of a grove, we demonstrated the trade-off between the cost of detection and the benefits of control (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g006">Figure 6</xref>). An optimum roguing frequency can be determined, balancing the increased cost of roguing more frequently against the improved control it leads to, although this optimum is conditioned on the initial level of disease (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003753-g006">Figure 6(d)</xref>) and the cost of examining a plant for disease symptoms relative to the difference between the sale price of the fruit from a single year's harvest and the yearly cost of cultivating a tree.</p>
<p>For simplicity and ease of presentation, our definition of the cost of control focused exclusively on the cost of detection and did not include the cost of removal. However, because an individual plant would potentially be surveyed many times, but can be removed at most once, we believe this is a reasonable simplification. While our methodology could readily be extended to include more complex economics (e.g. removal costs, cost of initial grove establishment, increased yield from older plants), or to allow for growers potentially ceasing cultivation if the net profit from a particular grove fell below zero despite the yield that would subsequently accrue, the broad result would certainly be robust to these changes. A more interesting extension would be control strategies that change over time. An example of this is a roguing interval that depends on the current (observed) prevalence of infection, and so that could cause surveying to slow down or even stop once the disease was judged to be under control. This differs from the implementation considered here, in which the cost of detection for low levels of initial infection and short roguing intervals may be overstated: any grower who surveyed weekly but did not find disease for a number of years would doubtless reduce the frequency of surveying or even stop entirely. Investigating this type of adaptive strategy, together with the consequential risk of failure that derives from having to predict whether the disease has actually been eradicated or has merely not been found recently, will form the basis of our future work in this area.</p>
<p>A number of previous models have used deterministic mean field representations of cultural control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Fishman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Chan1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Fishman2">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-vandenBosch1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Meng1">[81]</xref>. More recently stochastic, spatially-explicit models have predominated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Sisterson1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dybiec1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Dybiec3">[58]</xref>, although typically these models are not fitted to data (a series of studies of the failed eradication of citrus canker in Florida are the exception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Cook1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Parnell2">[8]</xref>). What previous models lack, however, is a treatment of the economic aspects of control, and the trade-offs and optima to which this can lead. While significant progress in examining this type of trade-off has been made using optimal control theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-NdeffoMbah1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-Forster1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003753-NdeffoMbah2">[83]</xref>, the complexity of the associated mathematics has necessarily reverted attention to deterministic, non-spatial models. Using a spatial, stochastic model parameterised with real data to balance the benefits of effective disease control against its costs is the novel aspect of our work. In addition to the additional insight into BBSC epidemiology obtained by our model fitting, providing a “real world” example showing how a mathematical model can be used to optimise and test both the epidemiological and economic aspects of control strategies for a plant disease is therefore the key contribution of this paper.</p>
