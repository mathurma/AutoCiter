<abstract>
<p>Genome-scale metabolic models provide a powerful means to harness information from genomes to deepen biological insights. With exponentially increasing sequencing capacity, there is an enormous need for automated reconstruction techniques that can provide more accurate models in a short time frame. Current methods for automated metabolic network reconstruction rely on gene and reaction annotations to build draft metabolic networks and algorithms to fill gaps in these networks. However, automated reconstruction is hampered by database inconsistencies, incorrect annotations, and gap filling largely without considering genomic information. Here we develop an approach for applying genomic information to predict alternative functions for genes and estimate their likelihoods from sequence homology. We show that computed likelihood values were significantly higher for annotations found in manually curated metabolic networks than those that were not. We then apply these alternative functional predictions to estimate reaction likelihoods, which are used in a new gap filling approach called <italic>likelihood-based gap filling</italic> to predict more genomically consistent solutions. To validate the likelihood-based gap filling approach, we applied it to models where essential pathways were removed, finding that likelihood-based gap filling identified more biologically relevant solutions than parsimony-based gap filling approaches. We also demonstrate that models gap filled using likelihood-based gap filling provide greater coverage and genomic consistency with metabolic gene functions compared to parsimony-based approaches. Interestingly, despite these findings, we found that likelihoods did not significantly affect consistency of gap filled models with Biolog and knockout lethality data. This indicates that the phenotype data alone cannot necessarily be used to discriminate between alternative solutions for gap filling and therefore, that the use of other information is necessary to obtain a more accurate network. All described workflows are implemented as part of the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) and are publicly available via API or command-line web interface.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genome-scale metabolic modeling is a powerful approach that allows one to computationally simulate a variety of metabolic phenotypes. However, manually constructing accurate metabolic networks is extremely time intensive and it is thus desirable to have automated computational methods for providing high-quality metabolic networks. Incomplete knowledge of biological chemistries leads to missing, ambiguous, or inaccurate gene annotations, and thus gives rise to incomplete metabolic networks. Computational algorithms for filling these gaps in a metabolic model rely on network topology based approaches that can result in solutions that are inconsistent with existing genomic data. We developed an algorithm that directly incorporates genomic evidence into the decision-making process for gap filling reactions. This algorithm both maximizes the consistency of gap filled reactions with available genomic data and identifies candidate genes for gap filled reactions. The algorithm has been integrated into KBase's metabolic modeling service, an automated metabolic network reconstruction framework that includes the ModelSEED automated metabolic reconstruction tools.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) integrate available information about metabolism to provide a basis for holistic modeling and prediction of metabolic phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Edwards1">[1]</xref>. GEMs have been utilized broadly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Reed1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Benedict1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Duarte1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Milne1">[5]</xref> across all three domains of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Woese1">[6]</xref> to accelerate research in such areas as network evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Ibarra1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Ma1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Pl1">[9]</xref>, synthetic biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Lee1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Milne2">[11]</xref>, and the discovery of novel drug targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Lee2">[12]</xref>. However, achieving a sufficiently accurate metabolic model to enable high utility currently requires a very time-intensive manual reconstruction process, often taking many months or even years to complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>. As the throughput of sequencing technologies continues to increase and as research on microbial populations produces more and more genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Nelson1">[14]</xref>, there is a growing need for methods that automate high-quality metabolic model reconstruction.</p>
<p>Since the advent of genome-scale metabolic modeling, protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>, databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Schellenberger1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kanehisa1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Caspi1">[17]</xref>, algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-DeJongh1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry1">[20]</xref> and toolboxes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Agren1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Schellenberger2">[22]</xref> have been developed to help systematize the lengthy and iterative process of collecting, curating, and integrating large volumes of biochemical knowledge. There have also been previous efforts to fully automate this process, including, notably, the Department of Energy's ModelSEED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry1">[20]</xref>. Despite these important advances, significant barriers to high-quality automated metabolic reconstructions still persist. Even with human curation, ambiguous or incorrect annotations are still pervasive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Schnoes1">[23]</xref>. Incomplete annotations leave gaps in the metabolic networks that need to be filled in order to make simulation possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Orth1">[24]</xref>. Inaccurate annotations also give rise to the need to identify and assess the merits of alternative annotations for genes, a process that typically done manually as part of the model curation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>. An automated approach to model building that accounts for alternative annotations would help expedite manual curation and ensure that the draft models maximally account for alternatives that can be identified based on available data.</p>
<p>Existing algorithms for filling gaps, or dead-end reactions, in metabolic networks broadly fall into approaches based on network topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry2">[25]</xref>, pre-defined pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Karp1">[26]</xref>, or phenotype data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Herrgard1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Vitkin1">[29]</xref>. Parsimony-based algorithms such as GapFill identify dead-end reactions in a metabolic network and identify the minimum number of modifications to the network that can be made to activate those reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar1">[19]</xref>. Variations of GapFill have been developed that assign specific penalties based on thermodynamics or database incompleteness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry2">[25]</xref>. Pathway-based algorithms, such as that implemented in the PathwayTools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Karp1">[26]</xref>, automatically complete pre-defined pathways that have sufficient representation in the draft model. Finally, several algorithms use phenotype data to help choose gap filling pathways, including OMNI, which maximizes model consistency with reaction rate data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Herrgard1">[27]</xref>, GrowMatch, which maximizes consistency with experimental growth/no growth results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar2">[28]</xref>, and MIRAGE, which maximizes the co-occurrence and co-expression of connected reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Vitkin1">[29]</xref>. Uniquely among these methods, MIRAGE also automatically identifies gene candidates for optimal gap fill solutions.</p>
<p>While existing methods capably activate the necessary reactions to allow growth simulations, they often do so by fitting to phenotype data. Such fitting may result in the inclusion of spurious pathways which cause failures when testing the models against independent datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Heavner1">[30]</xref>. This is epitomized by a recent article that showed that in some cases, pruning these spurious pathways can lead to significant improvements in simulation accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Heavner1">[30]</xref>. Although genomic evidence may be incorporated after gap filling through human curation of potential solutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Blais1">[31]</xref>, these solutions are unlikely to fully reflect all the available knowledge of the genome. Methods that addresses both the resolution of dead-end metabolites and the identification of gene-reaction pairings for the reactions added to the model during the resolution of the gaps in the reaction network help researchers identify poorly-supported solutions when building models, thus helping to reduce over-fitting.</p>
<p>The goal of our work is to improve the quality of automatically generated metabolic reconstructions and models by explicitly incorporating alternative potential gene annotations and their estimated likelihoods into the gap filling process. We have developed a likelihood-based gap filling workflow that (1) assigns likelihood scores based on sequence homology to multiple annotations per gene and, from these, likelihoods for reactions in a network and (2) identifies maximum-likelihood pathways for gap filling using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. We have also developed a workflow to iteratively identify pathways that activates gene-associated orphaned reactions in a network and assesses the likelihood of these pathways. Critically, the likelihood-based approach makes the gap filling solution genome-specific and provides users with putative gene-protein-reaction relationships and confidence metrics for each result. We show that our likelihood-based approach improves the quantity and quality of new gene annotations compared to the existing gap filling algorithm. The resulting models have comparable accuracy when simulating high-throughput growth phenotype data, when compared with previous parsimony-based gap filling algorithms. The workflow tools are fully integrated within the Department of Energy's System Biology Knowledgebase (KBase), and are publicly available via both a web-based command line interface (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kbase.us" xlink:type="simple">http://kbase.us</ext-link>) and a web service API.</p>

<title>Gap filling workflows using likelihood and parsimony-based approaches</title>
<p>Confidence scores are useful for building models and assessing the quality of the annotations, reactions and pathways therein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>. We have developed a quantitative likelihood measurement for the evidence that a gene carries a specific annotated function and a technique by which these likelihood estimates can be converted into the likelihood of existence of a reaction in a cell's metabolic network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>). Importantly, we simultaneously compute the likelihoods of multiple annotations for a single gene, which both broadens the space of testable annotation hypotheses in gap filling solutions and helps mitigate possible errors in the most likely annotation. We have also developed a method by which these annotation likelihoods are converted into likelihoods of metabolic reactions. These reaction likelihoods are useful to evaluate confidence in the inclusion of individual parts of a metabolic network.</p>
<p>In order to assess the efficacy of the likelihood-based gap filling approach, we implemented four gap filling workflows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003882-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s008">Text S2</xref></bold>). These four workflows use two gap filling algorithms (parsimony-based versus likelihood-based gap filling) as applied to two separate gap filling strategies (targeted versus iterative gap filling). The goal of both algorithms is to alter the reaction network by adding new reactions or altering existing reactions. Here, we use the terms parsimony-based and likelihood-based to describe the two gap filling schemes according to their core mode of reaction addition. Both schemes can prioritize changes in reversibility or add special consideration to edge cases such as the addition of transporter reactions. However, in parsimony-based gap filling, the overall goal of parsimony-based gap fill is to make the least number of modifications in order to fill a gap. In general, this means that the shortest reaction path is incorporated into a network. In contrast, likelihood-based gap filling weights genomic evidence and takes into account how likely a reaction is to be included in the network. Likelihood-based gap filling favors reaction paths supported by evidence over paths without any supporting evidence from the genome.</p>

<title>Gap filling workflows.</title>
<p>We have developed four gap filling workflows and used them to generate the results in this paper: targeted parsimony-based gap filling, targeted likelihood-based gap filling, iterative parsimony-based gap filling, and iterative likelihood-based gap filling. The individual steps are described in detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>, and the technical details of running them using the web interface are described in the supplementary material. Green boxes represent inputs to the workflows. “Limit” is the user-defined time limit and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> is a system-defined maximum possible time limit for gap filling (currently one day) to prevent overloading the compute servers.</p>

<p>In targeted gap filling, which is the most commonly used in the field, gap filling is used to activate one particular reaction in a model such as the biomass reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar1">[19]</xref>. The target reaction is activated either by adding new reactions to the model from a universal reaction database or by changing the reversibility of existing reactions in a model. A successful application of targeted gap filling enables simulations to be performed on the resulting model using an increasingly large suite of constraint-based analysis algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Price1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Lewis1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the second strategy, which we call <italic>iterative gap filling</italic>, targeted gap filling is applied iteratively to all inactive reactions in a network, hence maximizing the number of activated reactions in a network. High-priority reactions such as those in central metabolism are activated first (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). One could imagine such an approach would sacrifice specificity for sensitivity (while targeted gap filling to achieve only biomass production would do the opposite). In the iterative gap filling workflows, a post-processing step is also used to reduce the redundancy resulting from attempting to activate every gene-associated reaction, to assess the value of each gap filled pathway in terms of how much of the original annotated network is corrected by the pathway, and optionally, to apply a cutoff to the cost of pathways added to the model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Methods</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s008">Test S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s009">S3</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Likelihoods reflect a measure of confidence in predicted function</title>
<p>As part of the model curation process, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of each annotation and fix those which are found to be problematic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>. We have implemented a simple method to estimate annotation likelihoods accounting for two sources of ambiguity: (1) sequence divergence between query genes and the genes in the reference database, and (2) inconsistencies in annotation within the reference database (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We characterized the utility of our reaction likelihoods by comparing the gene-reaction links created using our automated likelihood-based approach to those present in manually curated metabolic networks of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Reed1">[2]</xref> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> str. 168 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry2">[25]</xref> (note that iJR904, an older <italic>E. coli</italic> model than the most recent, was used because the ModelSEED database does not yet link annotations to periplasmic reactions and the gap filling implementation does not yet properly support compartmentalized models). We found that highly likely gene-reaction links were significantly enriched in the models compared to less-likely gene-reaction links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003882-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>) indicating that a higher likelihood score reflects higher confidence in the predicted function. We also identified large numbers of high-likelihood gene annotations that are not in the comparison models, which reflect promising candidates for further investigation and possible inclusion in the models.</p>

<title>Proof of principle for likelihood-based gap filling</title>
<p>Unlike the parsimony-based gap filling approach, the likelihood-based approach is able to produce different solutions for different organisms, even if the starting network is identical, based on the organisms' genetic content. To demonstrate the utility of this approach in improving model quality, we identified a set of 32 reactions from the iBsu1103 genome-scale metabolic model of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry2">[25]</xref> that were predicted to be essential for growth and whose existence in the model was supported by literature evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Oh1">[34]</xref>. This set of reactions represented a gold standard set of reactions that should be incorporated into gap filling solutions if they were missing. We then removed all 32 gold standard reactions from the iBsu1103 model and applied the targeted parsimony-based gap filling and likelihood-based gap filling algorithms to restore biomass production in the knockout model.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the effects of parameterizing each algorithm, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the effects of modifying penalties for adding transporters and for making thermodynamically unfavorable reversibility changes (see Supplemental Material). Larger penalties for these types of changes make it less favorable for the algorithm to pick them over other changes to the network when fixing network gaps. Since the removed set of reactions did not include transporters or reversibility changes, higher penalties for transporters or reversibility changes led to greater accuracy in the returned reactions. The penalty for transporters that maximized the accuracy of the returned pathways was higher for parsimony-based gap filling (55 or greater - equivalent to adding about 7 intracellular reactions on average) than for likelihood-based gap filling (25 or greater). The penalties for thermodynamically unfavorable reversibility changes that maximized accuracy were also higher for parsimony-based than likelihood-based gap fill (40 and 12, respectively). Therefore, likelihood-based gap filling reduced the need to have very large penalties for these categories of network changes in order to obtain accurate solutions.</p>
<p>Although both methods had the same number of tuning parameters available, likelihood-based gap filling successfully outperformed the parsimony-based method by replacing a maximum of 31 of the 32 gold-standard reactions. Parsimony-based gap filling only replaced only a maximum of 24 reactions, regardless of the chosen penalties (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s002">Dataset S2</xref></bold>). The failures in parsimony-based gap filling were a result of picking shorter pathways to fill certain gaps for which longer pathways are the correct choice. For example, the synthesis of isopentyl diphosphate (IPDP), a primary precursor for lipid synthesis, can occur by one of two routes, the mevalonate pathway and the non-mevalonate pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kuzuyama1">[35]</xref>. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> uses the non-mevalonate pathway for IPDP synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Rohdich1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Eisenreich1">[37]</xref>. The mevalonate pathway contains fewer reactions than the non-mevalonate pathway, and thus the parsimony-based gap filling approach incorrectly used the mevalonate pathway to restore IPDP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003882-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). However, all of the knocked out reactions in the non-mevalonate pathway had high estimated likelihoods. Hence, likelihood-based gap filling correctly chose this pathway to restore production of IPDP.</p>

<title>Likelihood-based gap filling produces more and higher-confidence annotations than post-processing</title>
<p>One important step in curating gap filling solutions is identifying genes in the genome that could be responsible for catalyzing the gap filled reactions and assessing the quality of the genomic evidence behind these assignments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Blais1">[31]</xref>. Mapping between genes and reactions allows for a useful connection to genetic manipulations, drug targets, and experimental validation. We have compared the ability to identify genes with likelihood-based and parsimony-based gap filling by using the estimated Gene-Protein-Reaction relationships (GPR) from our likelihood computations to assign genes to reactions that are gap filled using each approach. We found that likelihood-based gap filling produced significantly more links between genes and reactions and more gene-associated reactions than post-processing of parsimony-based gap filling results (i.e. seeking for gene homology after reactions were gap filled). This was true for both the targeted gap filling and iterative gap filling approaches, though the effect was greater for iterative gap filling (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003882-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). By virtue of the optimization formulation, the average quality of annotation hypotheses generated from gap filling was also significantly greater for likelihood-based gap filling, as measured by computing the average likelihood of gene associations added using the likelihood-based approach vs. post-processing parsimony-based gap filling solutions (p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003882-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>).

<title>Likelihood-based and parsimony-based gap fill have similar consistency with experimental phenotypes</title>
<p>One commonly-used method to verify the integrity of genome-scale metabolic models is to compare their predictions with high-throughput phenotyping data, such as knockout lethality screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>. To test the impact of each of our workflows on the accuracy of model phenotype predictions, we applied our workflows to construct and fill gaps in genome-scale models for 22 organisms for which either Biolog or gene knockout lethality data was available. We then compared the predictions of these models to the phenotype data, without fitting to the data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003882-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). There were many differences in the pathways identified using likelihood-based gap filling compared to parsimony-based gap filling: between 5% and 30% of the reactions in a likelihood-based gap filling solution were not found in the parsimony-based solution, despite using the same parameters for each (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s007">Text S1</xref></bold>). However, the use of likelihoods did not significantly affect the phenotype predictions.

We also examined the lethality predictions specifically for genes added in gap filling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003882-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). The negative predictive value was essentially identical for all four workflows at 40%. However, there was a notable improvement in the positive predictive value in the iterative gap filling workflows (80%) compared to targeted gap filling workflows (35% for parsimony-based and 55% for likelihood-based gap filling). Taken together, these results indicate that iterative gap filling mostly adds genes predicted to be nonlethal knockouts, and that most of these predictions are correct.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An important feature of the likelihood-based gap filling algorithm is that it can differentiate between genomes by assigning organism-specific likelihoods for each reaction in a network. As a direct result, the gap filling solutions resulting from this algorithm are also organism-specific. This direct link back to evidence in the genome directly enables the identification of pathways that are not parsimonious, but that are most consistent with genomic data. We have shown that the likelihood-based approach increases both the quality and the quantity of hypothesized gene associations from gap filling, especially when using the iterative approach to maximize the number of activated reactions subject to evidence constraints. Of course, when building a high-quality network model, gap filled pathways should be evaluated by experts to evaluate the evidence cited in the algorithm, to search for existing experimental evidence in favor of or refuting the suggested solutions, or to design new experiments to test the existence of the hypothesized functions in the modeled organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Thiele1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Agren1">[21]</xref>. The reported confidence metrics for annotations and for reactions will help curators target these curation efforts.</p>
<p>The likelihood-based gap filling methods described in this manuscript use genomic evidence-based metrics for the confidence that can be placed in annotations and reactions. The pathways that result from maximizing confidence have a greater genomic coverage and stronger evidence for inclusion of genes compared with the common procedure of post-processing parsimony-based solutions. Therefore, including likelihoods into the gap filling procedure directly improves on the state of the art in evaluating and selecting gap filling solutions.</p>
<p>Despite the significantly increased level of evidence for gap filling solutions resulting from likelihood-based gap filling, we did not observe a significant difference from existing approaches in the accuracy of knockout lethality or growth (Biolog) predictions. This result suggests that using phenotype data to filter gap-filling solutions may not result in a more accurate metabolic network (that is, one that better reflects biological evidence for the specific components included). Indeed, validation metrics such as consistency with knockout lethality predictions have a large number of ways in which they could be fit to become consistent with phenotype data, which can lead to decreases in observed accuracy when the model is tested on new data not available during its construction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Heavner1">[30]</xref>. This tendency to overfit models makes the use of reaction confidence metrics essential when evaluating discrepancies between models and phenotype data.</p>
<p>The proposed integration of likelihoods into gap filling can serve as a tool for hypothesis generation in biology. An initial pool of potential annotations with associated likelihoods can be generated using many different methods such as protein co-localization or co-occurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-vonMering1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Plata1">[39]</xref> or from high-throughput ‘-omics’ datasets such as metabolomics. This initial pool can be quite broad (many alternative functions for each gene). The likelihood-based gap filling approach we have outlined is sufficiently general to incorporate likelihoods based on any type of evidence. The gap filling algorithm then selects from this broad pool of hypotheses for the new annotations that best explain a complex combination of biological observations, providing insights into enzyme promiscuity, adaptation, and evolution.</p>
<p>Finally, the KBase framework in which all of our workflows are implemented helps address the need for a unified framework for systems biology. In addition to gap filling, KBase includes implementations of many other modeling and reconstruction tools such as tools for the automatic generation of compartmentalized community models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Taffs1">[40]</xref> and phenotype reconciliation tools such as the gap generation algorithm implemented as part of the ModelSEED framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry2">[25]</xref>. We anticipate that the use of likelihoods to guide solutions of these algorithms would also lead to better-supported networks and improvements in the ability to assess solution quality independently of the test data itself, thus reducing the impact of overfitting. As systems biology expands to incorporate a greater number of high-throughput biological measures, the utility of computational frameworks for leveraging this vast knowledge <italic>in toto</italic> becomes increasingly important.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We have developed four workflows in the DOE KnowledgeBase framework: parsimony-based gap filling, likelihood-based gap filling, iterative gap filling, and likelihood-based iterative gap filling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003882-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). We have included as part of the Supporting Information detailed tutorials on the use of the KBase web-based interface (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s008">Text S2</xref></bold>) or the web service API (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s009">Text S3</xref></bold>) to perform each of these workflows.</p>
<p>Parsimony-based and likelihood-based gap filling attempt to activate single inactive reactions in a network by some combination of reversibility changes and addition of reactions from a universal reaction database. Parsimony-based gap filling assigns costs for adding reactions or changing their reversibility based on the source database for the reaction, the estimated standard Gibbs free energy of reaction, and whether it is a transport reaction (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s007">Text S1</xref></bold>). Likelihood-based gap filling modifies the cost of adding reactions (but not the cost of reversibility changes) by incorporating an estimated likelihood of existence of a metabolic reaction in an organism. Reaction likelihoods are computed based on an estimate of the level of evidence for a gene annotation (e.g. annotation likelihoods) and a mapping from annotations to reactions (via protein complexes).</p>
<p>Iterative gap filling is the iterative application of either parsimony-based or likelihood-based gap filling approaches to activate the maximum possible number of reactions in a metabolic network. The iterative gap filling workflows include a reaction sensitivity analysis to prune redundant or poorly supported reactions (“non-contributing” reactions).</p>
<p>The following sections describe the parts of these workflows in detail.</p>

The genome data is imported into the workspace as a Genome typed object, which is a standardized format compatible with all KBase tools that expect genomes as input. All results from subsequent analyses are also stored in a KBase workspace as typed objects (of different types), and the methods used to generate them are tracked to ensure data provenance.</p>

</sec><sec id="s4d">
<title>Calculating annotation likelihoods</title>
<p>Annotation likelihoods are computed in reference to a database of genes with high-confidence annotations. For this purpose, we compiled a list of the protein sequences for all proteins whose function was either literature-supported or called as part of at least one SEED subsystem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Overbeek1">[41]</xref>. Functional annotations in the SEED subsystems are manually curated using multiple sources of information such as sequence similarity, phylogeny and gene context, and therefore represent a high-confidence reference set.</p>
<p>To minimize the amount of redundancy in the list of target proteins, they were binned into organism taxonomic units (OTUs) with roughly 97% 16S rRNA similarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Davis1">[42]</xref>. The final target database included at most one protein from each OTU for each functional role. When possible, the representative protein was chosen from the representative organism of the OTU, which tends to be a better-understood organism with higher-quality annotations such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12. If the representative organism for an OTU did not have a protein with that role in a subsystem or with a literature backing, a representative protein was chosen at random from another member of the OTU.</p>
<p>The computation of annotation likelihood scores was designed based on the principle that genes with more similar sequences are more likely to share the same function, but recognizing that these relationships are far from perfectly predictive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Eisen1">[43]</xref>. The computation thus attempts to quantify the uncertainty in relation to the available database of high-confidence annotations by accounting for both the similarity of the query gene to genes in the reference database and the distribution of annotations of the reference genes (Figure S3).</p>
<p>Annotation likelihoods were calculated by first running BLASTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Camacho1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Altschul1">[45]</xref> with an E-value cutoff of 10<sup>−5</sup> against all of the genes in the high-confidence gene annotation data set. A log-score for each (query, target) pair was computed as:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003882.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003882.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><italic>E<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the E-value for the BLASTP hit between the protein products of genes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> and <italic>S<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the log-score between them.

The sum in the numerator is over all BLASTP hits from gene <italic>i</italic> to genes with a particular annotation <italic>a</italic> and the sum in the denominator is over all BLASTP hits from gene <italic>i</italic>. Squaring the scores prevents large numbers of weak hits from dominating the computed likelihood.</p>
<p>The pseudocount was chosen to set the likelihood of a gene having moderately high homology (E = 1E-40) to a single protein in the database to 50% and is a typical parameter used in tools such as BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Altschul1">[45]</xref> to ensure that we offset for potentially incomplete or biased database representations of gene families. According to this formulation, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>i</italic> ∈ <italic>A<sub>a</sub></italic>) will be high only if the protein product of gene <italic>i</italic> possesses strongly significant sequence similarity to reference proteins with <italic>annotation a</italic> and does not possess similarly strong similarity to proteins with other annotations. Therefore, the metric takes into account two different sources of annotation ambiguity: divergence of sequence and disparity of annotations for similar proteins in the target database.</p>

<title>Calculating reaction likelihoods</title>
<p>Annotation likelihoods are useful for evaluating individual annotations, but must be converted into likelihoods for metabolic reactions in order to use them in the context of evaluating a metabolic network. Reaction likelihoods represent the confidence in the inclusion of a particular reaction in a metabolic network. The conversion from annotation likelihoods into reaction likelihoods takes into account the facts that annotations can imply multiple functional roles, a protein with a particular functional role could be part of multiple protein complexes, and multiple complexes could catalyze the same reaction. We used the ModelSEED reaction database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry1">[20]</xref> as the source of all of these links.</p>
<p>The first step in computation of reaction likelihoods is the conversion of gene annotations into functional roles, to account for the possibility that an annotation implies multiple protein functions. The likelihood that each gene <italic>i</italic> ∈ <italic>G<sub>O</sub></italic> also belongs to the set of genes <italic>R<sub>r</sub></italic> with functional role <italic>r</italic> was computed as the sum of the likelihood that gene <italic>i</italic> had each annotation that maps to role <italic>r</italic>.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003882.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003882.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Here the mapping <italic>a</italic>→<italic>r</italic> from annotations to roles is defined by the ModelSEED database. This definition ensures that if a protein could be multi or single-functional, the final reaction likelihoods reflect each of those possibilities.</p>
<p>In the second step, the likelihood that <italic>at least one</italic> gene in <italic>G<sub>O</sub></italic> had role <italic>r</italic> was computed as the maximum likelihood of the role across all genes in <italic>G<sub>O</sub></italic>.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003882.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003882.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The genes most likely to fulfill role <italic>r</italic> (within 80% of the maximum) were retained and linked with an OR relationship to form a Boolean Gene-Function relationship.</p>
<p>In the third step, the ModelSEED reaction database was used to compute the likelihood of existence of protein complexes from the likelihood of existence of functional roles. A protein complex represents a set of protein functions that must all be present in order to build a multi-subunit enzyme (for example, an ATP binding subunit and a translocating subunit must both be present to build certain ABC transporters). Since all of the subunits must be present to perform the function, the likelihood of the existence of a complex <italic>c</italic> in the cell was computed as the minimum likelihood of the roles associated with it.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003882.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003882.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The mapping <italic>r</italic>→<italic>c</italic> from roles to complexes is provided by the ModelSEED reaction database. The sets of genes possessing each function in a complex were linked with an AND relationship to form a Boolean Gene-Protein relationship.</p>
<p>In the fourth step, reaction likelihoods were computed from protein complex likelihoods using complex-reaction links in the ModelSEED. Since multiple complexes can independently catalyze a reaction, the likelihood of the existence of a reaction <italic>x</italic> in the cell was computed as the maximum likelihood of the possible complexes that could catalyze it.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003882.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003882.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The complexes that could catalyze the same reaction were linked with an OR relationship to form a Boolean Gene-Protein-Reaction relationship (GPR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Reed2">[46]</xref>. Only complexes with a likelihood within 80% of the maximum complex likelihood associated with a reaction were retained in the GPR for that reaction. The computed GPR was used in simulations of gene knockouts for gap filled reactions, and the reaction likelihoods were used as weights in the objective function for likelihood-based gap filling (see below)</p>

<title>Targeted gap filling to complete media</title>
<p>In all workflows, targeted gap filling is performed first in order to activate the biomass equation and achieve growth on ‘complete’ media. Complete media consists of all compounds for which the organism has transport reactions in the draft reconstruction, and hence the solution to this gap filling problem represents reactions that would be necessary for growth on any more limited media for which the organism possesses transporters.</p>
<p>Targeted gap filling is performed using either the parsimony-based or the likelihood-based approach. The parsimony-based gap filling approach, used in the ModelSEED for auto-completing models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry1">[20]</xref>, has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry2">[25]</xref>. The parsimony-based approach minimizes the number of additions to a model. Penalties are added for use of less-confident biochemical databases, adding reactions with ambiguous compounds, adding of transport reactions, or making thermodynamically unfavorable reversibility changes. Higher penalties make it less favorable for the algorithm to make these types of modifications. Detailed descriptions of the formulation and penalties are available in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s007">Text S1</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>The likelihood-based gap filling approach uses the same MILP formulation as parsimony-based gap filling. However, likelihood-based gap filling uses reaction likelihoods to re-weigh the objective coefficients. To do this, the likelihoods of reactions <italic>p(x)</italic> are first converted into costs <italic>C(x)</italic> by inverting them:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003882.e008"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003882.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Then, modified gap filling objective coefficients <italic>λ<sub>gapfill</sub></italic><sub>,<italic>x</italic></sub> are computed as follows:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003882.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003882.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>λ<sub>gapfill</sub></italic><sub>,<italic>x</italic></sub> is the objective coefficient in the gap filling formulation for reaction x and the P-values represent the same penalties as used in the existing parsimony-based approach (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003882.s007">Text S1</xref></bold>). In our modified formulation, higher-likelihood reactions are given lower costs (though the thermodynamic penalties for adding a reaction in the wrong direction are not changed) and are therefore favored in the optimization provided their benefit outweighs costs of other reactions in a pathway. The numeric parameters (12 and 10) in the equation make changing the reversibility of a reaction with low estimated Gibbs energy equivalent to adding (on average) one to two intracellular reactions in a favorable direction, while changing a reaction with reaction with an estimated Gibbs energy of 10 kCal/mol is equivalent to adding three average intracellular reactions in a favorable direction.</p>
<p>Due to the difficult nature of mixed-integer programs, obtaining a solution can take a long time for certain problems. Therefore, we have implemented a system in which a time limit is initially imposed on solution time and automatically increased if solving fails. An error is ultimately thrown if the solver fails to find a solution within one day or if no solution exists.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4g">
<title>Iterative gap filling</title>
<p>In iterative gap filling work flows, all reactions in the model that are associated with one or more genes are targeted to enable flux. Iterative gap filling is similar to the previously published gap find and gap fill algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Kumar1">[19]</xref>, but operates on inactive reactions rather than dead-end or orphaned metabolites. This is accomplished by performing targeted gap filling on one reaction at a time until as many reactions as possible are functional. These targeted gap fillings can be performed using either the parsimony-based approach (parsimony-based iterative gap filling) or the likelihood-based approach (likelihood-based iterative gap filling).</p>
<p>The results of iterative gap filling depend on the order in which the targets are processed. In our studies, the order was selected based on the region of metabolism in which the reaction occurs. Central carbon reactions were gap filled first to ensure that core metabolism was functional. These were followed by reactions involved in biosynthesis of essential metabolites (amino acids, nucleotides, and cofactors), finally culminating in reactions involved in peripheral utilization and degradation pathways.</p>
<p>After ordering reactions according to this priority, flux variability analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Mahadevan1">[47]</xref> was used to determine if each reaction had a non-zero maximum flux. If the maximum flux was zero, gap filling (likelihood or non-likelihood-based) was run to attempt to activate the reactions with pathways from the ModelSEED reaction database. If a gap filling solution was found, it was integrated into the model before moving onto the next reaction in the model. The final result was a set of pathways that activated a maximum number of reactions in the model.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4h">
<title>Reaction sensitivity analysis and deleting non-contributing reactions</title>
<p>Since iterative gap filling attempts to fill the maximum number of gaps in a model, solutions that fill different gaps in the model are often redundant or very poorly supported. To solve this problem, we have implemented a reaction sensitivity analysis that identifies for each gap filled reaction (including reversibility changes for existing reactions in a network): a) whether each gap filled reaction causes other reactions in the model to become inactive when it is removed and b) whether the gap filled reaction is predicted to be essential for growth. After performing reaction sensitivity analysis, any non-contributing reactions, which are non-essential gap filled reactions that do not activate any other reactions in the network, were removed from the model. For parsimony-based iterative gap filling, reaction sensitivity was performed on all reactions in the reverse order in which they were added, so that lower-priority gap filling solutions would be tested for removal first. For likelihood-based iterative gap filling, reaction sensitivity analysis was done in order from lowest to highest likelihood so that gap filled reactions that were unsupported by genetic evidence would be tested for removal first.</p>

<title>Targeted gap filling to minimal media</title>
<p>In order to support simulations of Biolog data and achieve greater completeness of the metabolic network, the models gap filled on complete media are gap filled again to achieve non-zero biomass production on a minimal media. In this study Carbon-D-Glucose was used as the minimal media. This gap filling step can be performed using either the targeted or likelihood-based approach.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4j">
<title>Phenotype simulations</title>
<p>To perform phenotype simulations, high-throughput data is imported into the KBase workspaces and saved as PhenotypeSet objects in the workspace. These objects contain links from phenotype sets to specific media and genes in a genome, and represent the results of Biolog or knockout lethality experiments in a consistent format.</p>
<p>In this study, the ModelSEED algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Henry1">[20]</xref> was used to build a draft model for each of 22 organisms for which either gene knockout lethality data (8 organisms), Biolog data (9 organisms), or both (5 organisms) was available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Forsyth1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Ji1">[60]</xref>. All four gap filling workflows (targeted parsimony-based, targeted likelihood-based, iterative parsimony-based, and iterative likelihood-based) were independently applied to the draft model to build working models of each of these organisms. The gap filled models were verified to predict positive biomass production on Carbon-D-Glucose media using flux balance analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Orth2">[61]</xref> before performing further simulations.</p>
<p>To simulate gene knockout lethality phenotypes, the models growing on Carbon-D-Glucose media were first further gap filled (if necessary) to achieve nonzero biomass production on the media in which knockout experiments had been performed (this was only necessary for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>). Subsequently, the knockouts were simulated by evaluating the Boolean GPR rules for each reaction and setting the maximum rate of each reaction whose GPR evaluated to FALSE to 0. Flux balance analysis was then used to maximize the biomass equation. The knockout was considered lethal if the predicted biomass production rate was less than 10<sup>−9</sup> <italic>hr</italic><sup>−1</sup>. For parsimony-based gap filling knockout simulations were performed both before and after integrating predicted gene protein reaction associations for gap filled reactions into the model.</p>
<p>To simulate Biolog data, the models growing on Carbon-D-Glucose media were modified to possess transporters for every compound in every media in the Biolog array. After this modification, growth on each media was tested by setting exchange reactions for each compound not in the media to zero and using flux balance analysis to predict the biomass production rate. The model was considered non-growing if the predicted biomass production rate was less than 10<sup>−9</sup> <italic>hr</italic><sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<title>Workflow implementation details</title>
<p>All gap filling for this manuscript was performed outside of KBase using CPLEX under an academic license (IBM Corporation, version 12.5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-CPLEX1">[62]</xref>. Due to licensing restrictions, gap filling performed on KBase servers is done using SCIP 3.0.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003882-Achterberg1">[63]</xref>.
