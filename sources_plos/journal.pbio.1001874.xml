<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Peripheral infections leading to an inflammatory response can initiate signaling from the hematopoietic system to various organs including the brain. The traditional view of this communication between blood and brain is that individual factors are released by immune cells that in turn bind to neuronal or nonneuronal target cells in the brain where they exert their effects. By using a genetic tracing system, we now show that extracellular vesicles, small membrane structures that can contain a multitude of different molecules, can transfer functional RNA directly from blood cells to neurons. Although this type of signaling is highly restricted in the healthy animal, inflammatory injuries increase both the frequency of transfer and the range of the neuronal target populations in the brain. By showing altered miRNA profiles in neurons receiving extracellular vesicle cargo, we predict a complex regulation of gene expression in neural cells in response to peripheral inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The influence of the immune system on the brain in the context of inflammation is highly relevant for a number of diseases, yet mechanisms for this interaction are not fully understood. The stereotypical response is the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells. These peripheral cytokines in turn can have a direct effect on neural cells or activate brain inflammatory cytokine signaling, usually via microglia, the principle innate immune cells of the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Glass1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, heterotypic cell fusion of hematopoietic cells with Purkinje neurons in the brain has been suggested as a conceptually different mechanism of response to inflammation. When transplanted into lethally irradiated mice, genetically labeled hematopoietic donor cells have been found to contribute to a number of host tissues including skeletal and cardiac myofibers, hepatocytes in the liver, intestinal crypt cells, and Purkinje neurons in the brain. Initially seen as evidence for an unexpected differentiation potential of hematopoietic stem cells, it was eventually demonstrated that the experimentally observed plasticity was largely attributable to cell fusion, rather than transdifferentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Terada1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-AlvarezDolado1">[4]</xref>. For the brain, fusion of hematopoietic cells has so far mainly been reported with Purkinje neurons. Although the number of fusion events is very low in the healthy animal, peripheral inflammation induces cell fusion events to increase by a factor of 10–100, giving the first indication that heterotypic fusion is regulated by a pathologic stimulus and may therefore be of biological significance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Johansson1">[5]</xref>. We were interested in studying the contribution of hematopoietic cells to neural tissue without the accompanying confounding factors such as lethal irradiation, chemoablation, or parabiosis normally associated with replacing the host bone marrow. In contrast, to irreversibly label hematopoietic cells to follow their fate <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the hematopoietic-specific promoter vav <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-deBoer1">[6]</xref> in a Cre reporter background. Although in our mouse model we could observe recombination events in the same tissues and at a frequency comparable to those observed in transplantation studies, we did not find any evidence for cell fusion in Purkinje neurons, marked by the absence of a second nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Nern1">[7]</xref>. We now show that recombination in neural cells is caused by the intercellular transfer of Cre recombinase messenger RNA. More specifically, biochemical analysis demonstrates that Cre mRNA is contained in extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. These EVs are sufficient to induce recombination in neural cells after direct intracerebellar injection. Recombination events occur rarely and are restricted to very few Purkinje neurons in the healthy animal. However, when inducing a peripheral inflammation or an entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL), the number of recombined cells increases dramatically and extends to other neuronal cell populations. Importantly, recombined versus nonrecombined Purkinje neurons display differences in their miRNA profile several days after inflammation, indicating biologically significant changes. These observations reveal the existence of a previously unrecognized mechanism to communicate RNA-based signals between the hematopoietic system and various organs, including the brain, in response to inflammation.</p>

<title>Expression of Cre Recombinase Specifically in the Hematopoietic Lineage Leads to Recombination Events in Purkinje Neurons Without Cell Fusion</title>
<p>To monitor the contribution of hematopoietic cells to other tissues without any of the confounding factors associated with host bone marrow replacement, we previously utilized transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase specifically in the hematopoietic lineage under the Vav1 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Nern1">[7]</xref>. For this study, we additionally included a mouse model expressing Cre under the hematopoietic- and endothelial-specific promoter Tie2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Koni1">[8]</xref> to minimize the possibility of false positive results due to a leaky expression of Cre. Thus, in hematopoietic cells, marker gene expression is irreversibly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), allowing the tracing of hematopoietic contribution to any other tissue. Confocal analysis of different tissue sections of both Vav-iCre- and Tie2-Cre-GFP/LacZ mice showed GFP- or LacZ-positive cells in organs such as the liver, lung, and small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>) similar to observations made in animals transplanted with bone marrow from constitutively marker-gene-expressing cells. In the cerebellum, only Purkinje neurons could be observed expressing the marker gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). However, all marker-gene–positive Purkinje neurons from both mouse lines contained only a single nucleus in line with our previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Nern1">[7]</xref>, suggesting a contribution of hematopoietic-to-neural cells independent of cell fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, in both our transgenic models we could make observations similar to what had been reported for chimeric animals but with no evidence of cell fusion in neurons.</p>

<title>Noninvasive tracing of hematopoietic Cre recombinase activity.</title>
<p>(A) Expressing Cre recombinase specifically in the hematopoietic lineage reveals the contribution of hematopoietic cells to nonhematopoietic tissues by irreversibly switching on reporter gene expression after excision of a floxed stop codon. β-galactosidase expression after recombination can be observed in multiple tissues such as liver (B), lung epithelia (C), and small intestine (D). In the intestine, the labeling of an entire crypt indicates recombination of an intestinal stem cell with concomitant inheritance of the marker to all progeny.

<title>Hematopoietic Cell-Derived Exosomes Contain Cre mRNA</title>
<p>The observation of Cre-dependent reporter gene expression without evidence of cell fusion events led us to consider alternative explanations for a transfer of Cre recombinase from hematopoietic cells to neurons. A growing body of evidence suggests a role for EVs in cell-to-cell communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Thery1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, EVs can transfer functional mRNA between cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Valadi1">[10]</xref>. We therefore asked if reporter gene expression in nonhematopoietic cells was the result of an RNA-based transfer of Cre recombinase via EVs, leading to the translation of Cre RNA in target cells and nuclear recombination followed by irreversible reporter gene expression. Because low levels of recombination events could be detected in uninjured animals, we hypothesized that Cre messenger RNA should be detectable in the blood of mice with hematopoietic Cre recombinase expression. Peripheral blood was drawn from six Vav-iCre mice and processed according to a protocol for the isolation of secreted membrane vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Thery2">[11]</xref>. In all vesicle isolation experiments, the pellet was treated with RNaseA to remove RNA that was not contained in vesicles. RNA was extracted from vesicle preparations and reverse transcribed, followed by nested primer RT-PCR. Cre recombinase cDNA could be detected in four out of six analyzed blood samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), showing that Cre mRNA is present at low levels in blood plasma. To obtain larger amounts of secreted membrane vesicles for a more detailed analysis, we prepared <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures from pooled peripheral blood and bone marrow of Vav-iCre mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6 separate preparations from one to two mice each) and added lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 200 ng/ml to stimulate an inflammatory reaction. Cell culture supernatants were collected after 3 d of stimulation, and membrane vesicle fractions enriched for exosomes were prepared via differential ultracentrifugation. The resulting supernatants and pellets were used for RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and subsequent detection of cDNA using PCR. Consistently, Cre recombinase cDNA could be detected in the vesicle pellet but not in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) in all experiments, suggesting that Cre mRNA was not part of the soluble cell culture medium but was contained in physical structures amenable to separation by centrifugation. To directly show that Cre mRNA is contained in vesicles and does not sediment because of an association with protein complexes, we took vesicle pellets prepared as above and treated them with RNaseA alone or in combination with detergent. In this way, vesicles would be lysed and the RNA exposed to RNase digestion. Indeed, in the samples treated with detergent and RNAse, we could no longer detect Cre mRNA in contrast to vesicle pellets that were treated with RNAse alone (<italic>n</italic> = 2 independent sample preparations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Electron microscopic images from our vesicle preparations showed predominantly structures with sizes between 50 and 100 nm and a round or cup-shaped morphology typically associated with exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Fevrier1">[12]</xref>. EVs are a heterogeneous population and their typology is not established with regard to their possible biological functions. However, the most prominent subclass are exosomes as defined by their size, protein marker load, and enrichment profile by differential density ultracentrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Thery1">[9]</xref>. To specifically determine whether exosomes contain Cre mRNA, we fractionated the vesicle preparations using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Keller1">[13]</xref>. Exosomal identity was confirmed by Western blot analysis for the specific surface markers ADAM10 and CD9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Using antibodies against Cre recombinase, we could not detect Cre recombinase protein in any of the fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). We could also not detect any Cre protein by ELISA with a sensitivity of 0.1 ng/ml in total EV preparations of bone marrow and peripheral blood of a single mouse (unpublished data). Thus, our EV preparations do not contain Cre protein or only at exceedingly low concentrations. Cre recombinase RNA could always be detected by RT-PCR in all exosomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Nonexosomal fractions varied with regard to the presence of Cre mRNA, ranging from its complete absence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) to individual subfractions being positive for Cre-derived cDNA (<italic>n</italic> = 5 preparations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). The latter observation indicated either trace amounts of exosomes in fractions negative for exosomal markers or Cre mRNA containing nonexosomal vesicles. Quantitative analysis of vesicle number and size revealed an increase in the share of larger membrane blebs or apoptotic vesicles in the <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations compared to blood plasma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Our results demonstrate that Cre mRNA but not Cre recombinase protein is contained predominantly in exosomes and suggests that functional Cre recombinase protein was generated from Cre RNA contained in vesicles rather than recombination activity being a result of the direct transfer of Cre protein.</p>

<title>Cre mRNA is present in the blood plasma of Vav-iCre mice and contained in EVs including exosomes.</title>
<p>(A) Cre mRNA can be detected in vesicle preparations enriched for exosomes from the blood plasma of Vav-iCre mice by RT-PCR. Each lane represents a result from an individual animal. For detection of Cre mRNA, nested primer PCR was used. The PCR product at 100 bp represents the signal after the second round of amplification. (B) Cre mRNA is localized in the pellet but not in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation of conditioned medium from primary Vav-iCre–positive hematopoietic cells after stimulation by LPS <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cre mRNA was resistant to RNaseA treatment in all experiments. (C) After treatment with Triton-X to lyse EVs in combination with RNaseA digestion, Cre mRNA is no longer detectable in contrast to RNaseA treatment alone. (D) Vesicular structures between 50 and 100 nm in size were visualized in electron micrographs from Vav-iCre hematopoietic-cell-derived vesicle preparations (scale bar, 50 nm). (E and F) Secreted membrane vesicle subspecies can be separated by density by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Exosomal identity was confirmed by blotting against the specific protein markers ADAM10 and CD9 for all subfractions. (G) Cre protein could not be detected in any of the fractions. Positive controls for all antibodies are shown in boxes to the right. (H) Cre mRNA is present in the exosomal fractions 2–7. The nonexosomal vesicles fractions or apoptotic bodies are characterized by their variability of positive subfractions to complete absence of Cre mRNA. In this experiment, subfractions 9 and 10 are positive, whereas 8, 11, and 12 do not contain any Cre RNA.</p>

<title>Injection of Cre mRNA-Containing EV Preparations Is Sufficient to Induce Recombination in the Cerebellum</title>
<p>We wanted to test whether secreted Cre recombinase RNA-containing EVs are sufficient to induce recombination in Purkinje neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, EVs enriched for the exosomal fraction were prepared from peripheral blood and bone marrow cultures from Vav-iCre mice as described above. These preparations were brought into the circulation of ROSA26-lacZ reporter mice intravenously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Four days after injection, animals were transcardially perfused and analyzed for recombination events by X-Gal staining and immunohistochemistry in serial sections of the cerebellum. We could not observe recombination events in any of the brains of the animals analyzed (<italic>n</italic> = 4, unpublished data). These results suggested either that the amount of exosomes in our preparations was too low, leading to the quantitative absorption of vesicles <italic>en route</italic> to the brain, or that EVs could not cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). To circumvent these problems and to test whether induction of reporter gene expression in Purkinje neurons by Cre mRNA-containing EVs is formally possible, we directly injected 1 µl vesicle preparations into the cerebella of ROSA-LacZ reporter mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3, two injections in a single hemisphere of each mouse; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Serial sections of the complete cerebellar hemisphere were analyzed for reporter gene expression 4 d after injection. This analysis identified Purkinje neurons expressing the reporter gene in all three injected animals with one to seven recombined Purkinje neurons in a single hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed other reporter gene-positive cell types with glial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) or microglial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) morphology in addition to Purkinje neurons in all injected animals. Hence, Cre mRNA-containing EV preparations are sufficient to induce recombination events in the brain, and the transfer of functional Cre mRNA by EVs appears not to be necessarily restricted to Purkinje neurons. Control brains from ROSA-LacZ mice that were injected with purified recombinant Cre recombinase protein (1 µl of 1 U/µl) (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or lysate prepared from Vav-iCre bone marrow cells (BMCs) (<italic>n</italic> = 2) did not display reporter gene expression in Purkinje neurons or any other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Recombination Events in Purkinje Neurons Are Not the Result of an Endogenous Misexpression of Cre Recombinase</title>
<p>To formally rule out the possibility that the recombination events we observe were resulting from an unspecific expression of Cre, we performed additional control experiments. First, we established cerebellar slice cultures from Vav-iCre- or Tie2-Cre-ROSA-LacZ/GFP mice (<italic>n</italic> = 4). After 2 d in culture, we induced an injury by transversally cutting into the tissue with a blade, and 3 d later slices were analyzed. We could only detect occasional recombination events in the Purkinje cell layer and no recombination in the injured areas, indicating a lack of Cre activity in the absence of a hematopoietic system. Next, we generated blood chimeras by transplanting Vav-iCre-GFP bone marrow into lethally irradiated ROSA-LacZ reporter mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6). In this way, we could identify cells that received Cre recombinase from the donor population while controlling for the possibility of cell fusion through the constitutive expression of GFP in the donor cells. After 5 wk or 2 mo, respectively, we induced peritonitis and 4 d later the chimeric animals were killed (for an experimental scheme, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We could observe LacZ-positive, GFP-negative cells in the livers of all animals (<italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In the cerebellum, recombined cells became apparent only in the longer surviving animals (2 mo, <italic>n</italic> = 3). We could identify β-galactosidase–positive, GFP-negative cells in the Purkinje layer (3.3±1.2 SD in one hemisphere) but also in the granular layer (5±1.7 SD in one hemisphere) as well as in cells associated with blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g004">Figure 4C–E</xref>). In the latter two locations, we never observed recombined cells in the Vav-iCre/Tie2-Cre-GFP/LacZ mice, indicating physiological changes caused by the irradiation. To test whether we could still observe recombination events in chimeras without the confounding influence of lethal irradiation, we performed adoptive transfer experiments whereby 20 million spleen/lymph node cells from Vav-iCre-GFP mice were i.v. injected into ROSA-LacZ reporter mice (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Ten days after the transfer, animals were killed and their livers and brains analyzed. Although we could detect recombined, GFP-negative cells in the livers of four mice, we did not observe any recombination in the brain, probably due to the low and short-lived cell number present in the recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Control animals for both types of experiments included ROSA-LacZ reporter mice as recipients injected with wild-type donor cells (<italic>n</italic> = 4). In sum, these experiments present formal evidence of a lateral transfer of Cre mRNA originating from blood cells, excluding fusion or endogenous misexpression.</p>

<title>Systemic and Central Nervous System (CNS) Inflammation Increases Recombination in Purkinje Neurons</title>
<p>Hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineage have been shown to contribute to nonhematopoietic tissues by heterotypic cell fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Nygren1">[14]</xref>. These fusion events are very rare, but their number increases substantially after peripheral inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Johansson1">[5]</xref>, leading to speculation that heterotypic fusion and subsequent reprogramming of the hematopoietic nucleus represent a sort of rescue mechanism for damaged tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Singec1">[15]</xref>. Likewise, inflammatory stimuli may affect EVs signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Distler1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Bala1">[17]</xref>. We induced a chronic inflammation by injecting Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC2) into the flanks of double transgenic mice, leading to the formation of a peripheral tumor after 12 d. For an acute inflammation, we induced peritonitis by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycolate broth and killed the animals 4 d after injection. In both models, we observed a significant increase in the number of recombined Purkinje neurons of up to three orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>). To complement these models of a systemic inflammation with a pathology that directly affects neural tissue, we induced an ECL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Prang1">[18]</xref> in Vav-iCre-LacZ mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and 4 d postlesion, we observed a significant increase in the number of recombined Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Altogether, on the basis of a total population of approximately 150,000 Purkinje neurons per cerebellum, the relative quantity of recombined Purkinje neurons after inflammation thus averages 5.8% but goes as high as 26% in one individual case. Importantly, none of the recombined cells that we had analyzed in more detail were binucleated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>), indicating that in our model systems injury is not sufficient to induce heterotypic cell fusion.

<title>Peripheral inflammation increases the number of recombined Purkinje neurons.</title>
<p>The number of recombined Purkinje neurons is low in healthy animals (A) but increases dramatically after peripheral inflammatory conditions (B). Inflammatory injuries were induced by subcutaneous injection of LLC2s or peritonitis. Animals were analyzed 12 d after injection when tumors were formed. Peritonitis was induced by a single i.p. injection of thioglycolate broth (1 ml in 3% PBS). Mice with peritonitis and ECL were analyzed 4 d after injection.

<p>Microglia are the main immune cells of the brain and are able to secrete EVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Potolicchio1">[19]</xref>. Therefore, we examined whether this cell type could be a possible source of Cre RNA-containing EVs in our model. We first analyzed brains from early postnatal (P4–P8) double transgenic Vav-iCre/Tie2-Cre-LacZ mice—the peak time of microglia invasion to the brain. In line with recent findings that the origin of microglia precedes definitive hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Ginhoux1">[20]</xref>, none of the microglia were positive for the reporter gene (unpublished data). Equally, we did not observe microglia expressing the reporter gene either in the healthy adult brain or after inflammatory injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g005">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Thus, in our model, Cre-mediated recombination activity in neurons is not induced by EVs of microglial origin.</p>

<title>EVs Targeting Neurons May Enter the Brain Via the Circulation</title>
<p>To gain insight into whether blood-derived EVs reach Purkinje neurons directly via the circulation or by entry of leukocytes into the brain and subsequent local release of EVs, we screened serial cerebellar sections from mice with peritonitis for CD45-LacZ double-positive cells (<italic>n</italic> = 6). We did not detect a single double-positive cell in the brain parenchyma, arguing against a transfer of EVs from leukocytes to neurons over a short distance. Next, we wanted to test whether EVs themselves may influence BBB properties in order to facilitate their passage into the brain. To this end, we measured changes in the electric resistance and capacitance over a monolayer of bEnd5 brain endothelium cells, a system that has been previously described as an adequate approximation of BBB properties <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Paolinelli1">[21]</xref>. EVs from three separate preparations from the supernatant of BMCs were added to the transwells (three separate measurements in quadruplicate). The supernatants of these EV preparations after the ultracentrifugation step served as negative controls. Addition of EVs, but not the supernatant, led to a decrease in the resistance and a concomitant increase in the capacitance at 24 h and 48 h but not any more at 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g005">Figure 5H,I</xref>). This suggests that EVs from the bone marrow are sufficient to make the BBB more permeable without lasting toxic effects.</p>

<title>Reporter Gene-Positive Neurons Are Present in Various Areas of the Brain</title>
<p>Heterotypic cell fusion in the brain induced by peripheral inflammatory injury has only been reported in Purkinje neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Johansson1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Priller1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Weimann1">[23]</xref>.

Analyzing mice with an inflammation revealed different brain areas with recombined neurons. These were tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). For this area, we could also observe recombined cells with a neuronal morphology that were negative for TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating loss of TH expression due to inflammation. Additionally we detected recombination in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g006">Figure 6D–F</xref>) and in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g006">Figure 6G–I</xref>). In the animals with an ECL, neurons in the hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 were recombined as well as cells at the lesion site that were neither of a neuronal nor astrocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g006">Figure 6J–L</xref>). All neurons displaying marker gene expression contained only one nucleus, consistent with our observations in the cerebellum that cell fusion between hematopoietic cells and neurons is not the reason for the observed recombination events.</p>

<p>Next we wanted to test if an increase in recombination levels in Purkinje neurons is restricted to our injury model or constitutes a general response to any type of injury. Thus, we analyzed if a lesion that is specific for a selected group of neurons and that does not induce a systemic inflammation is capable of increasing recombination events in the Purkinje neuron population. To this end, we injected 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) into Vav-iCre-LacZ mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3). MPTP is converted to the toxin MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) in glial cells that is then released and taken up specifically via the dopamine transporter of dopaminergic neurons, leading to cell death by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I. Animals were intraperitoneally injected with MPTP (30 mg/Kg body weight per day) on 5 consecutive days. Two weeks after the last injection, animals were killed and their brains analyzed. MPTP treatment leads to a massive reduction in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SN, more than in the VTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s003">Figure S3 A,B</xref>). As a result, we did not observe an increase in the number of recombined Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum comparable to levels seen after peripheral inflammation (53.3±14.7 SD labeled Purkinje neurons per cerebellar hemisphere, <italic>n</italic> = 3). Therefore, an increase in recombined Purkinje neurons seems to be more injury-specific, particularly for a peripheral inflammation and not to limited mechanical damage, similar to findings in the context of cell fusion where mechanical trauma did not lead to an increase in heterokaryon formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Johansson1">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, we could detect numerous TH-negative LacZ-positive cells with neuronal morphology in the SN/VTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s003">Figure S3C–E</xref>). This could indicate an effect of a cell-type-specific lesion on a heightened signaling of blood-derived EVs, but we did not formally test this possibility.</p>

<title>Purkinje Neurons Display a Different miRNA Profile After Recombination</title>
<p>Finally, we wanted to test whether the EV transfer of Cre mRNA to Purkinje neurons is accompanied by other cellular changes that may indicate a more than transient physiological response. EVs and exosomes contain short noncoding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs), and it has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that functional miRNAs can be transferred by exosomes to target cells where they exert their effects on gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Valadi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-AlvarezErviti1">[28]</xref>.

Hence we asked whether we could observe differences in the miRNA profile in recombined Purkinje neurons compared to their nonrecombined counterparts. To this end, we induced peritonitis in two Vav-iCre-LacZ mice. Four days later, these animals were killed and their cerebella snap-frozen and serially cut. After brief fixation, sections were stained for X-Gal and screened for marker-positive Purkinje neurons on a microscope fitted for laser capture microdissection (LCM). Cells that were X-Gal–positive and clearly identifiable as Purkinje neurons based on morphology and location were cut out and collected. To obtain a reference population that was as similar as possible, for each recombined cell a corresponding neighboring X-Gal–negative Purkinje neuron (&lt;5 neuron distance) was cut out and collected in a separate tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We collected 100 and 50 pairs of recombined/nonrecombined neurons. Material obtained in this way showed little RNA fragmentation as well as high specificity for Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s006">Table S2</xref>). Next, miRNAs were isolated from all four samples and analyzed by miRNA qPCR arrays. Pairwise comparison of the miRNAs from recombined neurons with their nonrecombined counterparts revealed significant differences in the presence or absence of various miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s007">Table S3</xref>) as well as changes in expression levels of common miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Comparing the miRNAs that were present in both sets of recombined neurons but not in any of the nonrecombined neurons yielded three miRNAs (Box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

The vesicle preparations for each group were separated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation as described above, and only the exosomal fractions were used for further analysis. miRNAs were isolated from both preparations and analyzed on a miRNA qPCR array.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our current study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism behind how the hematopoietic system may influence cellular processes in the brain in response to inflammation. Our results show that EVs, including exosomes, are released from hematopoietic cells and transfer functional RNA to cells of multiple tissues, including Purkinje neurons in the brain. This EV transfer is a relatively rare event under nonpathological conditions but can rapidly increase by orders of magnitude after peripheral inflammation. It is not restricted to Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum but includes multiple other neuronal types, notably dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Importantly, Purkinje neurons that receive EV RNA, measured by Cre-mediated induction of reporter gene expression, display a different miRNA profile compared to their nonrecombined counterparts, indicating physiologically relevant changes.</p>
<p>Exosomes are increasingly recognized as an agent that can transmit genetic information between cells, but their analysis has largely been restricted to <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Therefore, the finding that functional Cre mRNA can be transferred by exosomes leading to loxP excision in target cells will serve as a valuable tool to understanding the physiological role of exosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, our results also caution against a lateral transfer of Cre mRNA as a possible confounding factor when using the Cre-lox system for lineage analysis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study, we used two transgenic mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase in hematopoietic cells and one additionally in the endothelial lineage. Although in the Vav-iCre mouse Cre is constitutively expressed in virtually all hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-deBoer1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Ogilvy1">[32]</xref>, Tie-2 expression in the adult animal is generally associated with endothelial cells and tumor-infiltrating proangiogenic monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-DePalma1">[33]</xref>. However, its expression has also been described or suggested in other hematopoietic cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Puri1">[34]</xref>. Additionally, cells may up-regulate Tie-2 in response to inflammatory injury in yet other subpopulations. Based on the similarity of marker gene expression in both mouse models, we rule out endothelial cells as a source for EVs. In contrast, mouse lines expressing Cre under the nonhematopoietic promoters for nestin, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and glycine transporter 2 did not show any marker-gene–positive Purkinje neurons, further arguing against unspecific Cre expression (unpublished data). Importantly, the fact that we do not observe microglia expressing the marker gene in both animal models demonstrates that a vesicular transfer to neurons does not involve the participation of this cell type. Neither are microglia the target of peripheral blood-derived secreted membrane vesicles, although our results from the intracerebellar injection of Cre RNA-containing exosomes as well as published work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Fitzner1">[35]</xref> suggest that microglia can in principle take up EVs.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the cell of origin, horizontal transfer of genetic material by EVs may occur in two fundamentally different, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, ways: EV release by hematopoietic cells into the blood stream increases in response to a peripheral inflammation. They then reach the different organs via the blood supply where they are taken up by local cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). The specificity of this uptake is unknown, but work by others generally shows that EV uptake can be membrane-receptor-mediated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-ElAndaloussi1">[36]</xref> or occur by phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Feng1">[37]</xref>. The essential question in this model though would be how EVs are able to pass through the BBB. As a second possibility, leukocytes enter the brain and secrete exosomes that are taken up by cells in close apposition to the secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001874-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). The fact that we do not find any marker-gene–positive leukocytes in the cerebellar parenchyma together with the presence of Cre mRNA-containing vesicles in the peripheral blood of Vav-iCre mice suggests to us that the first route, via EVs in the circulation, is the more likely scenario. Together with the results from direct injection of Cre-containing EVs into the cerebellum, this also argues against other conceivable mechanisms enabling a local Cre transfer—for example, via tunneling nanotubes or gap junctions. However, our observations do not rule out instances of such a local transfer by leukocytes after entering the brain. Particularly for more severe injuries and pathologies such as lethal irradiation and induced autoimmune encephalitis that were used in studies of cell fusion, a leukocyte entry into the CNS parenchyma is known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Hickey1">[38]</xref>. Our results from the ECL indeed indicate that local transfer of EV Cre mRNA also could occur. The similarities in recombination pattern, frequency, and induction by inflammation compared to the phenomenon of heterotypic cell fusion are intriguing. We reason that in both cases lipid bilayer membranes need to fuse and that the fusion of whole cells might represent an extreme case of vesicle-cell fusion, triggered by the experimental conditions. The fact that none of the recombined neurons in our inflammation models was binucleated underlines the fact that an inflammatory stimulus as such is not sufficient to lead to cellular fusion, in contrast to reports using various experimental approaches to generate blood chimeras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Johansson1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Nygren1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<title>Model for EV transfer of RNA from immune cells to the brain.</title>
<p>Possible modes of RNA transfer from blood to brain: (A) EVs are released from blood cells into the blood stream, where they can cross the BBB and fuse with neurons. (B) Alternatively, leukocytes enter the brain and only EVs released in short distance to the target cell are able to bind and release their content. This direct signaling of immune cells to the brain is independent of microglia.</p>

<p>The transfer of functional genetic material via EVs and concomitant changes in miRNA content of the receiving cells that we observe suggests a novel way in how the hematopoietic compartment may interact with multiple organs, including the brain, which deserves further study. Peripheral infections and inflammation have been linked to processes such as cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Grivennikov1">[39]</xref>, neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Glass1">[1]</xref>, and sickness behavior—that is, changes in cognitive functions due to peripheral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Dantzer1">[27]</xref>. So far, this link has been mainly explained as cytokine-mediated effects. Increasing evidence points to a central role of miRNAs in regulating neuronal function. In this respect our data open the possibility of a simultaneous lateral transfer of multiple miRNA species from blood cells via EVs as an additional factor contributing to inflammation-induced reactions. Interestingly, although the miRNA profile of nonrecombined Purkinje neurons from our analysis almost completely overlaps with published libraries specifically prepared from Purkinje neurons based on pcp2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-He1">[31]</xref>, we find significant differences in comparison to the miRNAs contained in the recombined Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001874.s009">Table S5</xref>). EV-derived miRNAs could act as a general stabilizer of transcription to compensate effects of cellular stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Schratt1">[40]</xref>. A recent report of oligodendrocyte-derived EVs increasing resistance of neurons against different types of stress <italic>in vitro</italic> could be a reflection of this function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Fruhbeis1">[41]</xref>. With regard to specific functions of individual miRNAs, interestingly miRNA-574-3p that we detect only in recombined Purkinje neurons as well as in exosomes from peripheral blood regulates and in turn is regulated by TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Kawahara1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Freischmidt1">[43]</xref>. TDP-43 is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein involved in RNA processing and stability and has a central role in neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration as the main component of brain inclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Baralle1">[44]</xref>. In the context of these diseases, miR-574-3p could be detected in the serum but also in cerebrospinal fluid, with a down-regulation in cerebrospinal fluid of affected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Freischmidt1">[43]</xref>. miR-484 has been reported to regulate mitochondrial fission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Wang1">[45]</xref>, and mitochondrial fission is involved in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and many neurological diseases. Finally miR-16 has been demonstrated to be a repressor for the serotonin transporter and is implicated in the therapeutic action of the antidepressant fluoxetine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Baudry1">[46]</xref>. Furthermore it is associated with neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Aranha1">[47]</xref>. Therefore, published evidence about the miRNAs that we identify in recombined Purkinje neurons is consistent with a functional role in neurons. Although we want to stress that our results are not formal proof for a direct transfer of miRNAs via EVs and that the presence of these miRNAs could also be the result of an indirect regulation, they nonetheless highlight the possibility of how miRNAs in body fluids may reach target cells in various organs, specifically neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that peripherally injecting exosomes containing exogenous siRNA against GAPDH and engineered to specifically target neurons could indeed lead to down-regulation of their target gene in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-AlvarezErviti1">[28]</xref>. Our data suggest that a more widespread gene regulation via changes in miRNA content in neurons naturally occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, there is increasing evidence that key proteins in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as α-synuclein or tau can associate with exosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Emmanouilidou1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Saman1">[49]</xref> or can be intercellularly transferred by as yet unknown mechanisms in Parkinson's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Clavaguera1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001874-Dunning1">[51]</xref>. In this context, our findings extend the possibility of a spreading of diseases between tissues with the involvement of EVs and provide an accessible method for further studies in this exiting field.</p>
