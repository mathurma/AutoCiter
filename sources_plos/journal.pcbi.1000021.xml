In response to microbial challenge, the TLR-stimulated macrophage undergoes an activation program controlled by a dynamically inducible transcriptional regulatory network. Mapping a complex mammalian transcriptional network poses significant challenges and requires the integration of multiple experimental data types. In this work, we inferred a transcriptional network underlying TLR-stimulated murine macrophage activation. Microarray-based expression profiling and transcription factor binding site motif scanning were used to infer a network of associations between transcription factor genes and clusters of co-expressed target genes. The time-lagged correlation was used to analyze temporal expression data in order to identify potential causal influences in the network. A novel statistical test was developed to assess the significance of the time-lagged correlation.

Stimulation of TLRs initiates a complex transcriptional program in which induced transcription factor genes dynamically regulate downstream genes.

A novel, unbiased method was developed to assess the significance of the time-lagged correlation. The inferred network of associations between transcription factor genes and co-expressed gene clusters was validated with targeted ChIP-on-chip experiments, and yielded insights into the macrophage activation program, including a potential novel regulator.

These networks typically involve a large number of transcription factors (TFs) that are activated in different combinations in order to produce a particular cellular response. The macrophage, a vital cell type of the mammalian immune system, marshals a variety of phenotypic responses to pathogenic challenge, such as secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, phagocytosis and antigen presentation, stimulation of mucus production, and adherence. In the innate immune system, the first line of defense against infection, the macrophage's Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role by recognizing distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as flagellin, lipopeptides, or double-stranded RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Underhill1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Takeda1">[2]</xref>. TLR signals are first channeled through adapter molecules (e.g., TICAM1/TRIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Hoebe1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Yamamoto1">[4]</xref> and MyD88 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Adachi1">[5]</xref>) and then through parallel cross-talking signal pathways. These activated pathways initiate a transcriptional program in which over 1,000 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref> and hundreds of TF genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref> can be differentially expressed, and which is tailored to the type of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nau1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Jenner1">[9]</xref>. The transcriptional network underlying macrophage activation can exhibit many distinct steady-states which are associated with tissue- and infection-specific macrophage functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Sasmono1">[10]</xref>. The transcriptional response is also dynamic and characterized by temporal waves of gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Jenner1">[9]</xref>, each enriched for distinct sets of gene functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Jenner1">[9]</xref> and likely to be controlled by different combinations of transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref>. Long-term, elucidating the transcriptional network underlying TLR-stimulated macrophage activation, and identifying key regulators and their functions, would greatly enhance our understanding of the innate immune response to infection and potentially yield new ideas for vaccine development.</p><p>Computational analysis of high-throughput experimental data is proving increasingly useful in the inference of transcriptional regulatory interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Basso1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Zhao1">[15]</xref> and in the identification and prioritization of potential regulators for targeted experimental validation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref>. Time-course microarray expression measurements have been used to infer dynamic transcriptional networks in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Wang1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Zhao1">[15]</xref> and static “influence” networks in mammalian cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Basso1">[11]</xref>. In the context of primary macrophages, expression-based computational reconstruction of the transcriptional control logic underlying the activation program is not straightforward and progress is difficult to measure, for several reasons. First, transcriptional control within mammalian networks in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-VanBuren1">[16]</xref>, and for key TLR-responsive genes in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref>, is combinatorial. Second, many induced TFs are subject to post-translational activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Honda1">[17]</xref> and dynamic control of nuclear localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>. Third, targeted genetic perturbations are presently infeasible to perform on a large scale in a mammalian animal model, and expression knockdown (RNAi) is difficult in macrophages due to the tendency of the vector to stimulate TLRs. Finally, the few transcriptional regulatory interactions that have been validated through targeted experiments in TLR-stimulated primary macrophages are not available in a single “gold standard” dataset. Therefore, in the context of transcriptional regulation in the mammalian macrophage, with presently accessible expression data sets, large-scale computational inference is primarily useful for statistically identifying potential regulatory interactions, rather than as an inference tool for predicting the transcriptional control logic for specific target genes.</p><p>For the reasons described above, in order to computationally infer transcriptional regulatory interactions in a mammalian system, it is necessary to include additional sources of evidence (beyond expression data) to constrain or inform the transcriptional network model selection. Computational scanning of the promoter sequences of clusters of co-expressed genes for known transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs has proved particularly valuable when combined with global expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Chiang1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Holloway1">[19]</xref>. Recently, Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref> used a combination of expression clustering and promoter sequence scanning for TFBS motifs to construct an initial transcriptional network of the macrophage stimulated with the TLR4 stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Their work identified two novel regulators, but the clustering was based on an expression dataset with a single stimulus, limited biological replicates, and few time points. Moreover, TFBS motif scanning of co-expressed clusters, without utilizing expression dynamics, provides only a limited and static picture of the underlying transcriptional network. Many TFBS motifs are often recognized by multiple TFs, making difficult the unambiguous identification of the regulating TF from TFBS enrichment alone. Furthermore, because of the tendency of TFBS motifs to co-occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Elkon1">[20]</xref>, it is difficult to determine from among a set of co-occurring motifs which associated TF is the most relevant to the condition-specific regulation of the target cluster. In the TLR-stimulated macrophage, core transcription factors already expressed in the cell (e.g., NFkB, AP1, and CREB) are rapidly activated and initiate transcriptional regulation of “second wave” TF genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>. Such transcriptionally regulated TF genes are key candidates for an integrated analysis combining TF-specific dynamic expression data and sequence-based motif scanning data.</p><p>This work is concerned with using computational data integration to identify a set of core differentially expressed transcriptional regulators in the TLR-stimulated macrophage and, in the form of statistical associations, the clusters of co-expressed genes that they may regulate. The clusters are differentiated based on temporal and stimulus-specific activation, and in this sense, the inferred associations constitute a preliminary dynamic transcriptional network for the TLR-stimulated macrophage. To achieve this, we used a novel computational approach incorporating TFBS motif scanning and statistical inference based on time-course expression data across a diverse array of stimuli. Our approach involved four steps. (i) A set of genes was identified that were differentially expressed by wild-type macrophages under at least one TLR stimulation experiment. (ii) These genes were clustered based on their expression profiles across a wide range of conditions and strains, grouping genes based on the similarity of the timing and stimulus-dependence of their induction. Gene Ontology annotations were used to identify functional categories enriched within the gene clusters. (iii) Promoter sequences upstream of the genes within each cluster were scanned for a library of TFBS motifs, each recognized by at least one differentially expressed TF, to identify possible associations between TFs and gene clusters. (iv) Across eleven different time-course studies, dynamic expression profiles of TF genes and target genes were compared in order to identify possible causal influences between differentially expressed TF genes and clusters.</p><p>Several techniques have been developed specifically for model inference from time-course expression data, notably dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Zou1">[21]</xref> and ODE-based model selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Bonneau1">[12]</xref>. However, the parametric complexity of these model classes makes it difficult to apply them to infer a network underlying a specific cellular perturbation (e.g., TLR activation in the macrophage) with a limited expression dataset. Here, potential transcriptional regulatory influence is inferred from time-course expression data using the time-lagged correlation (TLC) statistic, which has been used to infer biochemical interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Arkin1">[22]</xref> as well as transcriptional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Agrawal1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Raab1">[29]</xref>. The TLC has the advantage that it accounts for the time delay between differential expression of an induced TF and differential expression of a target gene. In contrast to standard correlation-based methods that identify co-expressed genes, the TLC method uses temporal ordering of expression to determine whether the time lag between two correlated genes is consistent with a causal interaction. We developed a novel method to identify the optimal time lag for each gene pair, and used a prior probability distribution of transcriptional time delays to score possible interactions.</p><p>By combining the promoter scanning-based evidence with the evidence obtained by the time-lagged correlation analysis of the expression data, we were able to identify a network of statistically significant associations between 36 TF genes and 27 co-expressed clusters. Overall, 63% of differentially expressed genes are included in the network. The network provided insights into the temporal organization of the transcriptional response and into combinations of TFs that may act as key regulators of macrophage activation. Finally, the analysis identified a potential transcriptional regulator, TGIF1 (<italic>Tgif1</italic>), which was not previously known to play a role in macrophage activation. As a targeted experimental validation of the inferred network, two transcriptional regulators, p50 (a component of NFkB) and IRF1, were assayed for binding to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in LPS-stimulated macrophages using ChIP-on-chip, and were confirmed to bind the promoters of genes in four out of five predicted target clusters at significantly higher proportions than expected for a random set of TLR-responsive genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gene selection and clustering</title><p>To probe a diverse set of transcriptional responses of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-stimulated macrophages, primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from five mouse strains (wild-type and four mutant strains; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000021.s019">Table S1</xref>) were stimulated with six purified TLR agonists representing various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

Genome-wide expression measurements of 45,037 probesets, representing 23,259 annotated genes, were made for time courses of up to 48 hours post-stimulation, using oligonucleotide microarrays (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Using a spline-based multivariate regression method specifically adapted for significance testing of temporal expression datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Storey1">[32]</xref>, annotated probesets were analyzed for differential expression across seven TLR-stimulated wild-type expression time-courses.

The clusters exhibit distinct temporal profiles of transcriptional activation and repression that vary in the time of initial response and the duration of differential expression. Across all four stimuli, cluster C28 is induced first (and has sustained induction), followed by cluster C27 (which undergoes transient (2–3 h) upregulation), and then by induction of C25 and C26. Induction of C27 and C28 is delayed approximately 1 h under poly I:C stimulation, while C26 fails to fully induce under poly I:C. A comparison of the responses of clusters under 8 hours post-stimulation (LPS, Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub>, poly I:C, and R848) enabled the segregation of these clusters based on the signal transduction pathway through which they are likely primarily regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000021-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

The set of time lags and the set of time-course experiments to use were selected according to a constraint (imposed to minimize interpolation error) that the target gene expression at maximum time lag must be interpolated from at least three measurements. Based on this constraint, and taking into account the expected precision at which the optimal time lag can be estimated (±5 min, based on the replicate variability in the expression data–see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), the set of time lags was chosen to be <italic>t</italic> ∈ {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 min}. Eleven time-course experiments satisfied the criteria (combining six stimuli and three genotypes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000021.s027">Table S9</xref>). The TLC <italic>ρ<sub>τ</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>(<italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>) was computed for each of the <italic>t</italic> values, for each pair of genes, using data from all eleven time-course experiments combined (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Consider a pair of genes (<italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>) satisfying the null hypothesis, and let <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>≡max(<italic>T</italic>), where <italic>T</italic> is the set of time points for a single time-course. In practice the expression of <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub> cannot be extrapolated beyond <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, so the effective number of data points for computing the TLC <italic>ρ<sub>τ</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>(<italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>) is limited to the number of time points within <italic>T</italic> that are less than <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>−<italic>t</italic>. Thus, the number of measurements that can be used to compute the TLC is <italic>t</italic>-dependent, and the distribution of TLCs for pairs of genes satisfying the null hypothesis depends on <italic>t</italic>. Therefore, one will more frequently observe (by chance) a TLC exceeding a given value (say, 0.9), by selecting the largest possible <italic>t</italic>. In addition, the high degree of synchronization within the transcriptional response, as well as the fact that all the SDR-transformed expression levels are zero at the initial time point, result in a second bias towards zero time lag. This effect is strengthened as the number of time points in the data set (per time-course) decreases.

Additionally, two filtering criteria were imposed: (i) <italic>P</italic><sup>scan</sup>(<italic>f</italic>,<italic>C</italic>)≤0.05, to ensure that there is a minimal enrichment of TFBS; and (ii) a cluster-average optimal time lag between <italic>f</italic> and <italic>C</italic> that was greater than 10 min, i.e., 〈<italic>θ</italic>〉<italic><sub>f,C</sub></italic>≥10 min (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

A total of 90 interactions involving 36 TF genes and 27 clusters (comprising 86% differentially expressed genes), were accepted based on the above criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000021-t001">Table 1</xref>). If the TLC <italic>P</italic> values were not included, and if the same rate of false discovery were imposed, the network would be significantly less parsimonious (∼150 interactions), due to the large number of TF gene families that map to a common motif. Overall network coverage was estimated by taking the fraction of differentially expressed genes that (i) are members of the 27 clusters in the network; and (ii) possess a match for a motif recognized by one or more of the TFs associated with the cluster. From this estimate the network contains 1,232 genes, or 63% of the 1,960 genes that are differentially expressed under TLR stimulation.</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-1000021-t001"

For each TF that was included in the transcriptional network, the number of targets was estimated using the promoter scanning data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The out-degree varied approximately 20-fold over the set of 36 TF genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000021.s015">Figure S14</xref>). The transcription factor MYC (which is involved in development and cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Mukherjee1">[53]</xref>) was found to be the most highly connected in the network (consistent with the high out-degree for MYC found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Basso1">[11]</xref>), followed by members of the E2F family of TFs (believed to play a role in cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Attwooll1">[54]</xref>).

Both the TFs and clusters were divided into subsets that are induced or repressed under LPS stimulation, and ordered within these subsets based on the time of 25% differential expression under LPS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Thus, the matrix is divided into quadrants; for example, the upper left quadrant contains connections between induced TF genes and induced clusters, and the lower-right quadrant contains connections between downregulated TF genes and downregulated clusters. The upper left and lower right quadrants contain primarily positive correlations, with most anti-correlated connections found in the upper right and lower left quadrants. In the upper left quadrant, the connections generally fall along an arc indicating the temporal sequence of TF gene activation. The anti-correlated “off arc” connections within this quadrant generally indicate the association between the falling edge of a transiently induced TF gene and the rising edge of a late-induced gene cluster. The only correlated “off arc” connections within this quadrant (<italic>Nfkb1</italic>→C28, and <italic>Junb</italic>→C11) have weak time-lagged correlation evidence, but a very significant motif scanning <italic>P</italic> value. In contrast, the downregulated gene clusters and TF genes are not as stratified as the upregulated clusters in terms of the time of differential expression, and thus associations appear throughout the lower-right quadrant.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000021-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000021.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Transcription factor genes associated with clusters in the inferred transcriptional network.</title><p>(A) The matrix shows associations between transcription factor genes and co-expressed gene clusters.

This validation consisted of demonstrating a statistical enrichment of ChIP-on-chip–identified binding for a given TF among genes within a cluster with which the TF was associated through our computational method, as compared to randomly selected TLR-responding genes.

This network consists of statistical associations between differentially expressed transcription factor (TF) genes and co-expressed clusters of genes, each indicating a possible role for the associated TF in regulating the cluster. Such associations have proved useful for generating and prioritizing testable hypotheses regarding transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Nilsson1">[7]</xref>. A novel computational approach was used that combined sequence- and expression-based evidence. Using expression data acquired under a comprehensive set of TLR stimuli (and sampled densely in time), differentially expressed genes were partitioned into clusters of co-expressed genes that revealed a diversity of induction time scales, functional enrichments, and stimulus-dependent activation patterns. The clustering enabled sensitive identification of TFBS enrichments despite uncertainty (due to limited sampling) in the position-weight matrices and in the appropriate score threshold for motif scanning. In addition, using the SDR-normalized expression data for clustering ensured that genes were clustered based on their temporal (and stimulus-dependent) activation profiles, rather than by the magnitude of fold-change. Early-upregulated clusters were found to be enriched for TFs, consistent with the idea that many regulators of the transcriptional program are themselves produced on-demand in response to TLR stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>. The early induction of a large number of TFs was an important indicator of the potential utility of analyzing temporal expression as an evidence for transcriptional regulatory interactions (TRIs).</p><p>The time-lagged correlation (TLC) was used to analyze temporal gene expression for TFs and gene clusters, and in addition to the correlation strength, the biological plausibility of the estimated optimal time lag was factored into the significance assessment for the TLC. This time lag is useful for distinguishing between genes that are linked by a regulatory interaction and genes that are merely co-expressed. The TLC is efficient to compute, and in general requires fewer measurements than methods that rely on estimating the joint probability distribution of the expression of two genes (e.g., pairwise mutual information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Basso1">[11]</xref>). This observation is related to the most notable drawback of the TLC, namely, that it is sensitive only to the covariance of the joint probability distribution, and not higher order moments (with significantly more expression measurements, a possible extension of this method could be to use time-lagged mutual information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Schreiber1">[75]</xref>). A second limitation of the TLC (and of any evidence based solely on lagged expression comparison) is that in practice it can be difficult to distinguish between indirect transcriptional regulation through a rapid-acting intermediary, and direct transcriptional regulation. Finally, while it is not a significant issue in the cluster analysis described in this work, we note that the proposed method for estimating the significance of the expression data for a single gene pair (Equation 6) is potentially not robust with respect to noise in the data. For the purpose of single-gene analysis, it could be improved by using a polynomial fit to the <italic>τ</italic> dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000021.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or by defining the optimal time lag to be the time lag that minimizes <italic>σ</italic>.</p><p>The specific implementation of the TLC approach used in this study has two key advantages. First, by selecting the optimal time lag for a TF–gene pair based on minimizing the lag-dependent <italic>P</italic> value rather than maximizing the squared correlation coefficient, the inherent bias of the TLC technique in selecting time lags was avoided. This made it possible to include the contributions of (i) the magnitude of the correlation, and (ii) the probability of observing the optimal time lag, to the significance of a pairwise association. Second, the probability distribution for time lags among true interactions was incorporated as a prior in the significance calculation. This enabled taking into account the biological plausibility of the time lag in computing the significance. This significance test for the TLC has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported.</p><p>With any network inference method based on pair-wise comparison of the expression profiles of a regulator and a possible target (including the TLC method), it is difficult to accurately resolve the multi-factorial control of a target gene. This is particularly true when the effect of one TF is simply to modulate (amplify or dampen) the time-varying influence of another TF on a target gene. Several additional mechanisms can confound or eliminate the correlation between the expression level of a TF gene and the chromatin-bound activity of the corresponding TF, including multimeric TF assembly from protein products of several genes, post-translational activation of the TF, dynamically regulated nuclear translocation, and dynamically regulated TF protein turnover. For example, in the case of ATF3, there is little correlation between differential expression and nuclear localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Gilchrist1">[6]</xref>, and as a result, this TF is not strongly implicated in the network via TLC. However, we note that the CREB/ATF binding motif was identified as enriched within the core early response cluster C27. Additionally, we note that given that the expression data set used in this work is densely sampled at early times (1–2 hours) and sparsely sampled at late times, our ability to leverage expression data as an evidence for TRI is reduced for very late-responding TF genes (e.g., <italic>Lmo2</italic>). In summary, with a limited expression dataset, a high-significance TLC by itself should not be regarded as sufficient evidence to infer a TF-to-target association, underscoring the importance of incorporating additional sources of evidence.</p><p>In the present work, promoter sequence scanning was used to identify TFBS motifs enriched within co-expressed gene clusters. Due to the often one-to-many mapping between TFBS motifs and TFs, the scanning-based evidence often identifies multiple candidate TFs with a gene cluster, of which perhaps a single TF may be the relevant regulator in the given condition. The TLC approach described here provides an objective statistical framework for evaluating the suitability of a proposed TF-to-target association based on a large set of time-course expression measurements. In particular, the approach enabled the preferential identification of TF-to-target associations for which the optimal time lag is biologically plausible, and the rejection of associations with a biologically implausible (e.g., zero) time lag. Four (TF,cluster) associations were validated using ChIP-on-chip assays, in which enriched binding of the relevant TF was shown among genes within the relevant cluster. The ChIP-on-chip enrichment <italic>P</italic> values are conservative estimates of the genome-wide binding enrichment, due to the fact that genes were selected for inclusion in the tiling array based on differential expression under LPS stimulation in a macrophage-like murine cell line (RAW 264.7). We note that for each of the two TFs assayed, two (TF,cluster) pairs were found to be enriched for binding based on ChIP-on-chip, but not based on the network analysis. Such false-negative predictions may be the result of binding sites sometimes occurring upstream of the 2 kbp region selected for TFBS motif scanning, the target TF being cross-linked to a DNA-bound co-regulator recognizing a different motif than the TF, or due to the TF recognizing a TFBS motif variant not represented in the motif database.</p><p>The inferred transcriptional network resulting from our analysis associates at least one TF with 27 of the 32 clusters. The 27 clusters comprise 86% of all differentially expressed genes, with an overall network coverage (including motif matches for individual targets) of 63%. An average of 3.3 TF genes were associated with each cluster, which may reflect the prevalence of combinatorial control in the transcriptional network. The TFs implicated in the network are also highly interconnected at the level of protein-protein interactions, and interacting TFs are found to co-associate with clusters in the network. Many TFs known to play a role in macrophage activation were strongly associated with clusters in the inferred network (e.g., NFκB, AP1, IRF family members, and STAT1). NFκB and AP1 appear to be the most prolific activators in the network. EGR family members appear to be associated with early-induced clusters, and IRF family members are associated with later-induced clusters. In particular, the network associated specific TFs with immunologically important gene clusters (e.g., EGR1/2 and AP1 regulating cluster C27; and NFκB and IRF1 regulating cluster C13). Finally, incorporating expression data enabled identifying a specific TF from among members of a large TF family recognizing a motif enriched within a target cluster; for example, the predicted interaction between IRF1 and C25 was validated by ChIP-on-chip. However, we note that more ChIP-on-chip data, with a variety of TF targets, would be required to quantitatively assess the performance of the combined network analysis compared to single-evidence analysis using sequence data or expression data alone.</p><p>We note that by including in the analysis only TFBS motifs for which at least one associated TF gene was differentially expressed, the inferred network does not include TFs for which there is <italic>no</italic> transcript-level differential expression; this trade-off enabled network inference based on <italic>dual</italic> criteria of motif match enrichment and the estimated time lag prior probability. Work is in progress to extend the analysis to include all 208 TFBS motifs corresponding to TFs that are transcriptionally expressed in the TLR-stimulated macrophage. Another limitation related to sequence scanning is that the promoter sequence data set used is purely upstream of the annotated transcription start site (TSS); recent evidence suggests that some TFs may be equally likely localized downstream of the annotated TSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Birney1">[76]</xref>. In future work, it could be productive to scan for TFBS motifs both upstream and downstream of the annotated TSS.</p><p>In addition to recapitulating known regulators, the analysis identified a potential transcriptional regulator not previously known to play a direct role in TLR-stimulated macrophage activation, TGIF1. TGIF1 is a three-amino acid loop extension homeobox protein that acts as an obligate repressor through either direct binding to the retinoic acid responsive element on DNA, or through its interaction with SMAD2 in the TGFβ pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Bartholin1">[71]</xref>. Its associated TFBS motif is enriched within the promoters of genes within cluster C26 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−2</sup>) and cluster C4 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−2</sup>), and <italic>Tgif1</italic> is strongly (11-fold) upregulated in murine macrophages in response to <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000021-Goldmann1">[77]</xref>. Particularly intriguing is the possibility that, in light of motif scanning evidence, TGIF1 may act as a transcriptional repressor of the cytokines <italic>Csf2</italic> and <italic>Gm1960.</italic></p><p>The approach of combining promoter scanning-based evidence with expression dynamics-based evidence enabled more specific identification of the TF gene(s) regulating a cluster than would have been possible using promoter scanning alone. Time-course expression data allowed, in some cases, the disambiguation of which TF gene (out of a family of TF genes associated with a given TFBS motif) is the likely regulator of a cluster enriched for the corresponding TFBS motif. Inclusion of expression data provided a second source of evidence to indicate the relevance of a given TF gene for predicting the condition- and time-specific expression of a target gene cluster. In total, these results validate the strategy of computationally integrating two distinct large-scale data sources (expression and genomic sequence) to infer a murine macrophage transcriptional network. In a future study, additional sequence-based data sources, such as evolutionarily conserved elements in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region, could be incorporated into the method.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All data were analyzed in MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) unless otherwise stated.

For each gene cluster with which a TF gene was associated, the number of genes within the cluster for which a motif match was found (corresponding to the TF gene), was tabulated.
