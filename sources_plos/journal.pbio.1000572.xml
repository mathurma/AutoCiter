</abstract><abstract>
<p>Rodents move their whiskers to locate and identify objects. Cortical areas involved in vibrissal somatosensation and sensorimotor integration include the vibrissal area of the primary motor cortex (vM1), primary somatosensory cortex (vS1; barrel cortex), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). We mapped local excitatory pathways in each area across all cortical layers using glutamate uncaging and laser scanning photostimulation. We analyzed these maps to derive laminar connectivity matrices describing the average strengths of pathways between individual neurons in different layers and between entire cortical layers. In vM1, the strongest projection was L2/3→L5. In vS1, strong projections were L2/3→L5 and L4→L3. L6 input and output were weak in both areas. In S2, L2/3→L5 exceeded the strength of the ascending L4→L3 projection, and local input to L6 was prominent. The most conserved pathways were L2/3→L5, and the most variable were L4→L2/3 and pathways involving L6. Local excitatory circuits in different cortical areas are organized around a prominent descending pathway from L2/3→L5, suggesting that sensory cortices are elaborations on a basic motor cortex-like plan.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The neocortex of the mammalian brain is divided into different regions that serve specific functions. These include sensory areas for vision, hearing, and touch, and motor areas for directing aspects of movement. However, the similarities and differences in local circuit organization between these areas are not well understood. The cortex is a layered structure numbered in an outside-in fashion, such that layer 1 is closest to the cortical surface and layer 6 is deepest. Each layer harbors distinct cell types. The precise circuit wiring within and between these layers allows for specific functions performed by particular cortical regions. To directly compare circuits from distinct cortical areas, we combined optical and electrophysiological tools to map connections between layers in different brain regions. We examined three regions of mouse neocortex that are involved in active whisker sensation: vibrissal motor cortex (vM1), primary somatosensory cortex (vS1), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Our results demonstrate that excitatory connections from layer 2/3 to layer 5 are prominent in all three regions. In contrast, strong ascending pathways from middle layers (layer 4) to superficial ones (layer 3) and local inputs to layer 6 were prominent only in the two sensory cortical areas. These results indicate that cortical circuits employ regional specializations when processing motor versus sensory information. Moreover, our data suggest that sensory cortices are elaborations on a basic motor cortical plan involving layer 2/3 to layer 5 pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensation in the rodent vibrissal system relies on active whisking for interactions with the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Ahissar1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Kleinfeld1">[2]</xref>. Motor circuits control whisker movement, while sensory afferents collect information about contact with objects. Interactions between motor and sensory systems are necessary for object localization and identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Ahissar2">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Nelson1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ascending sensory and descending motor pathways interact at multiple levels including the brainstem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Nguyen1">[6]</xref>, thalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Urbain1">[7]</xref>, and cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Chakrabarti1">[8]</xref>. Three areas in the cerebral cortex are activated by whisker stimulation. Primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) responds with short latencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-ArmstrongJames1">[9]</xref>, whereas secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) respond 10–20 ms later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Ferezou1">[10]</xref>. These areas are also strongly interconnected in a bidirectional manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Chakrabarti1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Hoffer1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In rodents, some of the cytoarchitectonic features of vM1, vS1, and S2 are area-specific, such as the presence of “barrels” in layer (L) 4 of vS1, and others are not, such as the presence of most cortical layers, including L1, L2/3, L5A, L5B, and L6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Zilles1">[12]</xref>. Here, to explore the synaptic organization of cortical circuits in these three areas, we used glutamate uncaging and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to map the local sources of excitatory synaptic input to individual excitatory neurons in vM1, vS1, and S2. We recorded from postsynaptic neurons distributed across L2–6 (i.e., all the cortical layers that contain excitatory neurons) and, for each one, stimulated presynaptic neurons also distributed across L2–6. The collection of synaptic input maps for each area was analyzed to extract a laminar connectivity matrix representing the local pathways between excitatory neurons in each area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Weiler1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Anderson1">[14]</xref>. These connectivity matrices provide a quantitative survey of the interlaminar organization of local excitatory networks in each of these three cortical areas.</p>

<title>Identification of Cortical Areas</title>
<p>We identified vibrissal motor cortex (vM1), primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex (vS1), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) based on anatomical coordinates, cytoarchitectonic features, anatomical labeling experiments, and in the case of vM1, optical microstimulation mapping. vM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was located in the posteromedial part of frontal agranular cortex, anteromedial to the barrel cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Ferezou1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Brecht1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Li1">[17]</xref>. When anterograde tracers were injected into vM1, fluorescently labeled axons were observed in brainstem nuclei involved in whisker motor control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s002">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Grinevich1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, microstimulation mapping using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) revealed that vM1 had the lowest thresholds for whisker movements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s015">14</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Ayling1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Hira1">[20]</xref>. vS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) was identified by the presence of cytoarchitectonic “barrels” in L4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Woolsey1">[21]</xref>. S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) was located in dysgranular cortex, lateral to the barrel cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Chakrabarti1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Ferezou1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Carvell1">[22]</xref>. Axons projected from vS1 to S2, and from S2 to vM1 and vS1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s002">Figure S1</xref>). These experiments enabled us to target our mapping experiments to specific cortical locations corresponding to vM1, vS1, and S2.</p>

<title>Mapping Local Excitatory Pathways with Laser Scanning Photostimulation (LSPS)</title>
<p>We prepared coronal brain slices containing vM1, vS1, or S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and used LSPS with glutamate uncaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Callaway1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Shepherd1">[25]</xref> to map excitatory inputs to excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1D–G</xref>). We excited small clusters of neurons at each site in an array of locations while recording from individual excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>), obtaining maps of local intracortical sources of excitatory input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1F,G</xref>).</p>
<p>To calibrate LSPS, we recorded in cell-attached mode from excitatory neurons, while uncaging glutamate on a grid around the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The spatial distribution of action potentials (APs) evoked by uncaging (the “excitation profile”) provides a measure of the effective spatial resolution of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). These data were used to estimate neuronal photoexcitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and the spatial resolution of LSPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) for photostimulating neurons in different cortical layers and areas. Photostimulation-evoked APs always occurred in perisomatic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s003">Figure S2</xref>) with short latencies, and almost always as singlets. Stimulation of strong synaptic pathways, such as L4→L3 in vS1, did not cause APs in the target location (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s003">Figure S2</xref>), indicating that synaptic activity did not cause APs in neurons that were not directly photostimulated. Ultraviolet (UV) attenuation in scattering tissue causes photoexcitation to decline as a function of depth in the slice; consistent with this, excitation was not observed for neurons deeper than 100 µm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s004">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Shepherd2">[26]</xref>. The total number of neurons excited per stimulus, estimated from the excitation profiles and measured densities of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s005">Figure S4</xref>), was in the range 50–200, consistent with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Weiler1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Shepherd2">[26]</xref>.

<title>vM1 Maps</title>
<p>Unlike vS1, vM1 lacks a distinct granular L4. The superficial layers L2/3 and L5A are compressed, and deeper layers L5B and L6 are expanded, consistent with vM1's location at the crest of a cortical convexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-vonEconomo1">[28]</xref>. In addition, L1 was thicker than in the other areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000572-t001">Table 1</xref>). Both superficial and deep L5 neurons had dense basal dendrites and a single apical dendrite extending to L1, and L6 neurons had apical dendrites that did not extend to L1; in some cases, these were inverted pyramids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

Distance is measured in normalized units along the radial directions (pia, 0; white matter, 1). Because of the curvature of vM1 at the cortical flexure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>), we converted map data from the coordinates of the slice image (<italic>x, y</italic>) to coordinates corresponding to an unfolded cortex (<italic>h, r</italic>), where <italic>h</italic> is the horizontal distance along the laminar contour and <italic>r</italic> is the distance along the radial axis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6</xref> provides a graphical illustration of the process of converting the pixels in an input map from <italic>x-y</italic> coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), using a spatial transform defined on the basis of the radial structure of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), into <italic>r-h</italic> coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6C,D</xref>).</p>

<title>Converting input maps to input vectors for connectivity matrices.</title>
<p>(A–D) Assigning coordinates of radial and horizontal distance to presynaptic locations in an input map: (A) Input map of a vM1 neuron. (B) Image of vM1 slice, overlaid with stimulus grid (blue dots), and radial spokes (yellow lines). Spokes were user-drawn along radial lines of the cortex. A central dashed spoke through recorded neuron's soma defines horizontal position <italic>h</italic>  =  0. These are used to measure stimulus grid locations (<italic>x, y</italic>) to transform them into (<italic>h</italic>, <italic>r</italic>) coordinates, where <italic>h</italic> is the horizontal arc distance (in µm) from the center spoke, and <italic>r</italic> is the normalized radial distance from the pia. Rainbow-like plots show interpolated maps of radial distance (C) and horizontal distance (D) for given points in an input map. (E–H) We selected points at a given presynaptic radial distance (two white boxes shown for adjacent superficial regions in E), within a limited horizontal range from the postsynaptic neuron. These regions were used to select points in the input map for binning purposes. By averaging the selected points in the input map at the given presynaptic depth (within the white boxes in F, for example), we converted input maps to input vectors (G). The postsynaptic radial distance for each recorded neuron was then used to place the input vectors in order, with vectors from superficial neurons in the top rows and deeper neurons in lower rows. By stacking the input vectors for every cell in a given cortical region, ordered by postsynaptic radial distance, a rough outline of the connectivity matrix can be presented (H).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000572.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>This approach allowed us furthermore to convert input maps into vectors, by averaging input across the horizontal dimension (<italic>h</italic>) at a given presynaptic radial distance (<italic>r</italic>) into bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6E–G</xref>; a similar analysis in the horizontal dimension is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s010">Figure S9</xref>). This is identical to averaging along the rows of input maps, except that it takes into account the curvature of the cortex. One neuron's input vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6G</xref>) thus represents the inputs to one neuron from different laminar locations; i.e., the horizontal dimension has been collapsed. Each neuron was also assigned a postsynaptic radial distance. This allowed us to group all the input vectors and then sort them by the postsynaptic neuron's depth in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Stacking the vectors on top of each other, sorted by depth, provided a raw connectivity matrix, <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>raw</sup></italic>(<italic>r</italic><sub>post</sub>, <italic>r</italic><sub>pre</sub>), describing connectivity between neurons at different locations along the radial axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g006">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The rows in such a connectivity matrix represent synaptic input to a particular laminar location, and the columns represent synaptic output from that laminar location. Intralaminar connections lie along the main diagonal. We note that intralaminar connectivity was undersampled because of direct excitation of the postsynaptic neurons' dendrites.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used glutamate uncaging and LSPS to map local synaptic connections among excitatory neurons in mouse vM1, vS1, and S2, three cortical areas centrally involved in vibrissa-based somatosensation. From single cell input maps recorded at different cortical depths, we derived connectivity matrices that compactly describe the local network. Our main findings were that vM1 contains a strong pathway from L2/3 to upper L5; that vS1 and S2 contain two strong pathways, corresponding to L4→L3 and L2/3→L5; and that S2 contains these plus pathways between L6 and L5B.</p>

<title>Connectivity Matrix Descriptions of Cortical Circuits: Neuron→Neuron and Layer→Layer</title>
<p>The connectivity matrix description allows us to directly contrast local circuits in different cortical regions. The elements (pixels) in the neuron→neuron connectivity matrices, <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>neuron</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7B,E,H</xref>), represent the mean strength of postsynaptic response in a single neuron extrapolated to a single presynaptic AP in a single cell of the indicated layer (<italic>q</italic><sub>con</sub>). Pixel values were 10–100 times lower than typical unitary EPSCs, reflecting both the generally low probability of connections between excitatory neurons in cortical circuits (typically 0.1–0.2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Lefort1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Song1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Morishima1">[35]</xref>, and the fact that the current amplitude in the maps represents a mean over 50 ms rather than the peak of the EPSC.</p>
<p>In contrast, the elements in the layer→layer connectivity matrices, <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>layer</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7C,F,I</xref>), represent the average strength of connections extrapolated to the entire projection from one layer to another. The <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>layer</sup></italic> matrices differ from the <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>neuron</sup></italic> matrices in that they enhance thicker and more neuron-dense layers and diminish thinner and less neuron-dense layers. For example, because in vS1 the L5A is thin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000572-t001">Table 1</xref>) and both L5A and L5B are low in neuronal density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s005">Figure S4</xref>), the projections to and from L5, such as L5A→L2/3 and L2/3→L5B, are relatively strong at the level of neuron→neuron connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) but relatively weak at the level of layer→layer connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Interestingly, in rat vS1 the L4→L2/3 projection is functionally weak compared to the structural density of L4 axons and L2/3 dendrites, while the converse holds for the L5A→L2/3 projection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Shepherd3">[36]</xref>. Our results here show how weak neuron→neuron connections may be strong in aggregate at the layer→layer level. Further structure-function analyses will be required to determine whether it is generally the case that larger and more neuron-dense layers have weaker neuron→neuron but stronger layer→layer projections.</p>

<title>Major Features of Connectivity Matrices in the Three Areas</title>
<p>The connectivity matrix representations of vM1 show strong descending projections from L2/3→upper L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7A–C</xref>), similar to the forelimb area of mouse M1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Weiler1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Anderson1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Yu1">[37]</xref>. This input straddled the L5A/B border. L5B received an additional hotspot from itself, which appeared strong when considered as an entire layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). The deepest one-third of vM1 (consisting mostly of L6) had weak inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>The vS1 excitatory circuits were more complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7D–F</xref>). The major ascending pathway from L4→L3 was paralleled by an ascending component from L5A. The high cell density in L4 made the L4→L3 connection prominent in the laminar analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Another prominent projection was from L2 and L3 to L5A and L5B; inputs originating in more superficial regions of L2/3 targeted relatively more superficial regions of L5A/L5B (note the diagonal shape of the L2/3→L5 hotspot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). On a neuron→neuron basis, the L3→L5B connection was stronger than L4→L3, although the layer→layer analysis showed a reduction in cell density relative to L4. L2 received input from L3, and weaker input from L5A. However, L2 was thin and thus contributed little to <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>layer</sup></italic>. As in vM1, deep layers had weak inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>In S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7G–I</xref>), an ascending L4→L2/3 pathway and descending L3→L5 pathway were present. Neurons on the L5A/L5B border also showed strong intralaminar connections. The L6 output evident in the input maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s008">Figure S7</xref>) also supplied potent input to L5B. Although not as strong at the single cell level, the entire L6 excited L5B as much as L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g007">Figure 7I</xref>). L6 was enhanced in S2 relative to other regions as both a source of synaptic output and a recipient of synaptic input, due to the relatively high density of neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s005">Figure S4</xref>) and their relatively low photoexcitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2C–E</xref>). The functional connectivity in the local excitatory circuits of all three regions is simplified into quantitative laminar wiring diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>LSPS with glutamate uncaging simultaneously excites a group of presynaptic neurons, while the postsynaptic response is measured. To derive average connection strength per neuron (<italic>q</italic><sub>con</sub>), the number of excited neurons needs to be estimated, based on the excitability (<italic>S</italic><sub>AP</sub>), neuron density (<italic>ρ</italic><sub>cell</sub>), and excitation volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>exc</sub>) at the uncaging location (Equation 1). The accuracy of the estimate of <italic>q</italic><sub>con</sub> is limited by our measurement of <italic>ρ</italic><sub>cell</sub> and neuronal excitation (<italic>S</italic><sub>AP</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>exc</sub>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s019">Text S1</xref> Equations 3–4): Measurements of neuronal density vary by a factor of two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Lefort1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Schuz1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Tsai1">[39]</xref>. Although excitation profiles give a direct measure of evoked APs in brain slices under the relevant recording conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g002">Figure 2</xref>), excitation varies across neurons and somewhat across cortical areas, and decreases with depth in the slice; these effects together introduce uncertainty roughly on the order of a factor of two (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s004">Figure S3</xref>). Despite these uncertainties, our estimates of <italic>q</italic><sub>con</sub> are broadly consistent with those derived from pair recordings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s014">Figure S13</xref>).</p>
<p>Because LSPS excites many neurons, this strong stimulus allows weak pathways to be detected. However, the average connection strength, <italic>q</italic><sub>con</sub>, reflects both the connection probability and unitary connection strength:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000572.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>It is therefore not possible to separate connection probability and unitary connection strength directly. Furthermore, <italic>p</italic><sub>con</sub> is inversely related to the horizontal separation between cell pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Holmgren1">[34]</xref>. LSPS averages inputs from a range of presynaptic locations with varied horizontal offset. For each cell class, a broad distribution of <italic>p</italic><sub>con</sub> values contributes to LSPS maps.</p>
<p>In addition, by computing the average connection strength, we average out the underlying distribution of unitary connection strength, which is a skewed distribution of numerous weak and a few strong connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Lefort1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Song1">[33]</xref>.

<title>Comparisons with Previous Studies of vS1 Connectivity</title>
<p>Comparison of our neuron→neuron connectivity matrix with a pair-recording study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Lefort1">[27]</xref> reveals qualitative similarities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s014">Figure S13</xref>). After both methods are corrected to similar units (peak amplitude in pA/AP), the general shape of the connectivity matrix and values for neuron→neuron connectivity are similar. The major interlaminar pathways are L2/3→L5 and L4/5A→L2/3. However, local intralaminar connections are underestimated in our data set due to direct responses to uncaging. Furthermore, descending projections from L4→L5A and from L5A→L5B may be underestimated in LSPS relative to pair recording due to exclusion of direct responses along the apical dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron (see L5A and L5B maps in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s007">Figure S6</xref>). Under-sampling of connected pairs in low-<italic>p</italic><sub>con</sub> pathways, such as L4→L6, may account for differences from LSPS, where many L4 neurons are excited during each L6 recording. Lastly, L2 connectivity differs in part because of differences in the definition of this layer.</p>

<title>Inter-Areal Comparisons: Ascending Pathways to Supragranular Layers</title>
<p>We compared the matrices for the four areas so far studied, vM1 (present study), the forelimb region of somatic M1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Weiler1">[13]</xref>, vS1 (also the present study) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Lefort1">[27]</xref>, and S2 (present study). Overall, the main differences are attributable to the presence of a distinct granular layer in somatosensory cortex. Specifically in vS1, L4 outflow contributed strongly to the connectivity matrix. L4→L2/3 is also a major pathway in rodent V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Dantzker1">[44]</xref>. In S2, the local excitatory circuit differs from vS1 most prominently in that the L4→L3 pathway is reduced. LSPS analyses of auditory cortex circuits have found L4→L2/3 inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Barbour1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Oviedo1">[46]</xref>, which is adjacent to S2. However, ascending pathways were not unique to vS1, as a similar but weaker L3/5A→L2/3 pathway was prominent in forelimb M1, and present but weaker still in vM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s006">Figure S5C</xref>, leftmost panels). The upward compression of layers in vM1, typical of cortical convexities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-vonEconomo1">[28]</xref>, may be why L3/5A→L2 was less distinct in vM1 than in forelimb M1 (e.g., it was more prone to masking by dendritic responses of L2 neurons). However, inspection of individual maps and traces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s006">Figure S5C</xref>) showed that these ascending pathways were present for some L2 neurons.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3f">
<title>Inter-Areal Comparisons: Descending Pathways to Deep Layers</title>
<p>A second main interlaminar hotspot in vS1 was the descending pathway(s) L2/3→L5, which was the predominant hotspot in the two motor areas. We noted that this pathway was present in all three cortical regions studied here and was similarly prominent in somatic M1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Weiler1">[13]</xref>. Indeed, it was the predominant pathway in S2. Thus, a strong supragranular to infragranular descending connection emerged as a common element of local cortical circuits examined here. Superficial L5B neurons and deep L5A neurons at the laminar border were most strongly activated, suggesting that the cytoarchitectonic boundaries identified do not correspond well with functional gradient within L5. Perhaps an alternative molecular marker, such as Etv1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s009">Figure S8</xref>), better denotes this functional division.</p>

<title>Inter-Areal Comparisons: Involvement of Deep Neurons in Local Circuit Function</title>
<p>In three of the four areas, L6 neither received nor sent strong projections (but vS1 neurons in L6 received a weak projection from L4). L6 output is provided by an ascending connection to L4 in cat visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Stepanyants1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Binzegger1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-TarczyHornoch1">[47]</xref> but was absent or reduced in all vibrissal areas we studied. L6→L4 projections studied in mouse somatosensory and auditory cortical areas have “modulator” rather than “driver” properties, including paired pulse facilitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Lee1">[48]</xref>. Although deeper neurons tend to have relatively small dendritic arbors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Andjelic1">[49]</xref>, which may account for a reduction (but not absence) of inputs, this difference in arbor size is not of sufficient magnitude to account for the paucity of inputs. Similarly, the paucity of outputs was not due to lack of photoexcitability of these neurons. Channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Petreanu2">[50]</xref> have shown that the supragranular layers indeed connect preferentially to upper rather than lower infragranular neurons. Thus, the lack of inputs was not due simply to slice-related artifacts such as severing of pathways. Consistent with weak local inputs, in vivo recordings in cat motor cortex suggest that a large number of L6 neurons are virtually silent, even during motor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Sirota1">[51]</xref>. Thus, the sources and modes of excitation for L6 neurons remain to be determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Andjelic1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Zarrinpar1">[52]</xref>. However, L6 was more engaged in local circuits in S2, supplying a measurable output to L5A and L5B and to other L6 neurons. In addition to input from L5B, L6 neurons in S2 collected inputs from a wide horizontal distance, sometimes &gt;300 µm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s008">Figure S7B</xref>,C at right). Thus, S2 may be better suited for studying L6 function.</p>

<title>Quantitative Comparison of Cortical Microcircuits</title>
<p>One major difficulty in making a comparison of connectivity between two cortical areas is selecting the laminar position of pre- and postsynaptic neurons for the comparison. Is it better to compare identical relative laminar depths between cortical areas, not accounting for the decreased thickness of superficial layers, and increased thickness of deep layers, in motor areas? How shall we treat the presence or apparent absence of a distinct layer 4? We present a direct quantitative comparison of three major areas identified in our study, based on cytoarchitectonic laminar divisions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000572-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s009">Figure S8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In vS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Svoboda1">[53]</xref> and vM1 (Tianyi Mao, BMH, GMGS, KS, unpublished observations) these layers correspond to distinct cell types with different projection patterns. The descending projection from L2/3→L5A/B was prominent in all areas, but the strength of the pathways at a neuron→neuron level varied by a factor of four between the areas. Ascending projections from middle layers to superficial ones (L4→L2/3 in vS1 and S2; L5A→L2/3 in vM1 for comparison) were also present in all regions but were the least prominent in agranular vM1. Lastly, the L6→L5 projection identified in S2 was more than twice as strong at the neuron→neuron level than in vS1 (and the difference was greater with vM1). Our approach provides a defined framework for measuring similarities and differences between cortical microcircuits in a quantitative manner.</p>

<title>Slice Preparation</title>
<p>Mice were decapitated at postnatal day 20–25 under isofluorane anesthesia, and the brain rapidly placed in ice cold choline solution (in mM: 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.1 sodium pyruvate, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Coronal brain slices (300 µm) were cut (Microm HM 650V), incubated 30 min at 37°C in oxygenated ACSF (in mM: 127 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-Glucose, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and maintained in a holding chamber at 22°C for up to 5 h during recording. For vM1 slices, the brain was pitched upward ∼10° to optimize alignment with the radial axis of vM1, and slices ∼0.7–1.3 mm anterior to bregma were used; for vS1 and S2 slices, the brain was cut coronally, and slices ∼1–2 mm posterior to bregma were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To determine the optimal slice angle for each area, we used the appearance of the intact apical trunk at high magnification to select slices for recording and avoided those sections where the apical dendritic trunk was at an angle with respect to the slice plane. Thus, only one or two sections per animal could be used for recording. Separate experiments in our laboratory using the photostimulation methods in vS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Petreanu1">[42]</xref> and vM1 (unpublished data) measure input to L1 dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons, confirming the apical trunk is intact using this slice angle. We added biocytin to visualize a subset of dendritic arbors, some of which are reconstructed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000572-g005">Figure 5</xref>. These neurons appeared radially symmetric, with arbors ranging from 300–500 µm in diameter. Since the neurons were 50–100 µm deep in the slice, a portion of the apical and basal dendrites are truncated by slicing and the deep half of the arbor is intact.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Recordings were performed at room temperature (22°C) in ACSF. Neuronal excitability was reduced by increased divalent ions (4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and NMDA receptor blockade with 5 µM 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP; Tocris). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass with filament (4–6 MΩ). Intracellular solution contained (in mM): 128 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 sodium phosphocreatine, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 3 sodium L-ascorbate, 1 EGTA, and 0.4 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP (pH 7.25; 290 mOsm). To visualize dendritic arbors, 20 µM Alexa 594 or 488 (Molecular Probes) was added to the internal solution. In some cases, 2–3 mg/mL biocytin was included. Electrophysiological signals were amplified with an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 4 KHz, and digitized at 10 KHz. Data I/O were controlled by <italic>Ephus</italic>, a suite of custom Matlab-based (Mathworks) software tools available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openwiki.janelia.org" xlink:type="simple">https://openwiki.janelia.org</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Suter1">[54]</xref>).</p>
<p>Neurons were selected based on pyramidal appearance, or in the case of L4 recordings in vS1, either pyramidal or stellate appearance.

MNI-glutamate (0.2 mM; Tocris, MO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Canepari1">[55]</xref>) was added to a recirculating bath. Photolysis was performed by shuttering (1.0 ms pulse) the beam of an ultraviolet (355 nm) laser (DPSS Lasers, San Jose, CA), ∼20 mW in the specimen plane, set by a combination of a gradient neutral density filter wheel and Pockels cell (electro-optical modulator; Conoptics). A 16×16 standard stimulus grid for <bold>input maps</bold> had row and column spacing of 110 µm for vM1 and 90 µm for vS1 and S2 recordings. Maps were recorded in voltage clamp at −70 mV.

The 256 grid sites were visited in a sequence that optimized the spatiotemporal separation between sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000572-Shepherd1">[25]</xref>. The sequence was repeated 2–4 times per neuron. In vS1 and S2, the map was aligned to the top of the pia and centered on the soma. In vM1, the medial edge of the map was aligned to the interhemispheric fissure, and the top to the dorsal-most edge of pia.</p>
<p>To convert each map's set of traces into an array of pixels that represent response amplitudes, we calculated the average current over a 50 ms post-stimulus window.

Individual recorded neurons were also assigned a postsynaptic radial distance based on the same criteria. Individual input maps for a given neuron could then be averaged together based on postsynaptic radial distance. Furthermore, when computing the input to a given neuron for the purpose of determining the connectivity matrix, a presynaptic point would be averaged into a bin appropriate to its location. Most aspects of local connectivity were robust to changes in binning. Subsequent corrections to the connectivity matrices were made to account for variations in excitability between layers, and the number of neurons in pre- and post-synaptic layers; these were then presented as neuron→neuron connectivity matrices and layer→layer connectivity matrices (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000572.s019">Text S1</xref>).</p>
