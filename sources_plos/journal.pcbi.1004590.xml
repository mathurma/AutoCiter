<abstract>
<p>Cancer genomes contain vast amounts of somatic mutations, many of which are passenger mutations not involved in oncogenesis. Whereas driver mutations in protein-coding genes can be distinguished from passenger mutations based on their recurrence, non-coding mutations are usually not recurrent at the same position. Therefore, it is still unclear how to identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory driver mutations, particularly when chromatin data from the same patient is not available, thus relying only on sequence and expression information. Here we use machine-learning methods to predict functional regulatory regions using sequence information alone, and compare the predicted activity of the mutated region with the reference sequence. This way we define the Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer (PRIME). We find that the recently identified driver mutation in the <italic>TAL1</italic> enhancer has a high PRIME score, representing a “gain-of-target” for MYB, whereas the highly recurrent <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutation has a surprisingly low PRIME score. We trained Random Forest models for 45 cancer-related transcription factors, and used these to score variations in the HeLa genome and somatic mutations across more than five hundred cancer genomes. Each model predicts only a small fraction of non-coding mutations with a potential impact on the function of the encompassing regulatory region. Nevertheless, as these few candidate driver mutations are often linked to gains in chromatin activity and gene expression, they may contribute to the oncogenic program by altering the expression levels of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Precise regulation of gene expression is controlled by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRM) containing binding sites for transcription factors (TF). The genome-wide location of all TF binding sites can often be obtained by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing), yet in most cases only a minority of the binding peaks actually represent functional CRMs that control the transcription initiation of a <italic>bona fide</italic> TF target gene. Here, we investigated for 45 cancer-related TFs how machine-learning approaches can be used to predict functional TF target CRMs. After careful evaluation of their performance, we used these TF-target classifiers to predict which <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations may have a significant impact on gene regulation by evaluating whether the mutation causes a significant gain or loss in the probability that the CRM is a functional TF target. We found that Random Forest classifiers can achieve more than 100-fold higher specificity for mutation prediction compared to the simple approaches based on scanning with position weight matrices. By scanning somatic mutations in breast cancer genomes and in the HeLa genome, we finally show that our TF-target classifiers can identify high impact non-coding mutations that are associated with concordant TF binding, gene expression changes and chromatin activity. In conclusion, TF-specific Random Forest classifiers can be used to prioritize <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations in cancer genomes with high accuracy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene regulation determines the identity and behaviour of all cells, and perturbations of gene regulatory programs can cause cells to change their identity or become transformed into cancer cells. Such perturbations of gene regulatory networks can be caused by driver mutations in signalling molecules, transcription factors (TF), and chromatin modifiers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, driver mutations can also occur within the non-coding genomic regions that control transcription, the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRM). CRMs harbour recognition sites for one to many transcription factors and regulate the transcription initiation rate at one or more nearby target genes. Recently two cancer-related CRM mutations have been discovered, namely: a highly recurrent mutation in the <italic>TERT</italic> promoter that is found in many cancer types [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; and a more distally located enhancer mutation upstream of the <italic>TAL1</italic> gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These two examples of driver mutations generate <italic>de novo</italic> binding sites for oncogenic transcription factors. Particularly, the <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations create new ETS-like binding sites (GGAA), while the <italic>TAL1</italic> mutation creates a MYB binding site. Interestingly, the latter is associated with a very significant gain of the activating histone modification H3K27Ac, indicating that the neomorphic enhancer actively regulates <italic>TAL1</italic> expression.</p>
<p>To analyze <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation on a genome-wide scale and to prioritize candidate driver mutations, several types of information can be exploited and integrated [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A first class of methods is based on <italic>filtering</italic> all candidate variants, such as single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small indels, to retain only those that affect “interesting” nucleotides. For example, a method called FunSeq retains mutations that affect “sensitive” genomic positions (FunSeq also combine other types of data [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Sensitive positions are determined by FunSeq as positions that are significantly infrequently substituted in the normal human population. Other methods, like OncoCis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and RegulomeDB [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], retain mutations that are located in candidate regulatory regions, as determined by publicly available regulatory data (e.g., from ENCODE [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). The disadvantage of this approach is that regulatory activity observed in a cancer sample may not correspond to any of the available annotation, particularly when the mutation creates a gain-of-function CRM, or in other words, publicly available regulatory annotation is not always indicative for the function of the CRM in the cancer sample under study. A solution to this problem could be to profile chromatin states in the actual cancer sample itself, but the currently available biochemical methods (mainly open chromatin profiling and ChIP-seq) still require relatively large amounts of input material, which is often not available for tumor biopsies. A second class of approaches is based on QTL analyses, whereby DNA variants are correlated with DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, or gene expression. These methods have been mostly applied to identify variation in the normal population [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] but when larger cohorts of more than 200 cancer samples become available (full genome, methylome, and transcriptome for each sample), they can, in principle, also be applied to identify cancer driver mutations. A related approach is to select mutations that cause allelic shifts in ChIP-seq reads, which was shown to identify functional SNPs that change enhancer activity in HepG2 cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A third class of approaches, which can be used in combination with the first two, investigates the mutated sequence itself, using information about TF recognition motifs and selects mutations that affect transcription factor binding sites. This can be achieved by scoring the reference and mutated sequences with a position weight matrix (PWM) of a particular TF, assessing the impact of the mutation by the difference of the scores for the reference and mutated sequence. For example, FunSeq calculates “motif maker” and “motif breaker” scores for PWMs and returns a list of all affected PWMs, for each mutation. A limitation of these methods is that PWM-scanning methods are notorious for generating high amounts of false positive predictions, which can affect the accuracy of PWM-based mutation scoring, yielding excessive amounts of false-positive mutations. The prediction of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations using PWMs would therefore benefit from more advanced models of TF target prediction, so that the impact of a mutation can be assessed more accurately, in the context of an entire CRM. By incorporating CRM context into a predictive model, we may achieve a higher accuracy for predicting functional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations. When using CRM prediction and classification methods to assess mutations, we can build on a large body of previous methods, using various kinds of features such as TF motifs, other (higher-order or structural) sequence features, sequence conservation, or chromatin related data. CRM prediction methods that are based on motif scanning usually score (sliding) sequence windows for the presence of clusters of TF binding sites, either for the same TF (i.e., homotypic clusters) or for different co-regulatory TFs (i.e., heterotypic clusters) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. CRM classification methods applying machine learning, using a training set of positive CRMs, are more flexible in terms of the types of features, and once a model is trained, it can be used to predict similar CRMs in the genome. For example, Narlikar et al., employed a Lasso model with a collection of 701 position weight matrices (PWMs), <italic>de novo</italic> discovered motifs and Markov models and were able to predict heart enhancers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. kmer-SVM [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or IMM [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] use a PWM-blind approach whereby the features are entirely learned from the sequence of training CRMs, as over-represented k-mers or Markov chains. Classifiers can also be trained using chromatin data, such as Chromia [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which uses chromatin data such as histone modification profiles as features in its model, trained on TF binding sites defined by ChIP-seq. It was shown for Chromia that such models, when combined with a PWM, can yield accurate genome-wide predictions of TF targets. More recent methods for enhancer classification use multiple layers of epigenomic data, such as chromHMM [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>We reasoned that such complex CRM models, when trained on sets of CRMs targeted by specific oncogenic or tumor suppressor TFs, could provide an interesting approach to score putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations, and to assess whether the mutation may cause a gain or loss of a functional TF target. To this end, we developed 45 Random Forest classifiers for more than forty different TFs, each trained on subsets of <italic>functional</italic> CRMs (i.e., regions bound by the TF that actively regulate target gene expression). We validate these models by cross-validation and genome-wide scoring, and apply them to identify PRIME mutations (mutations with high PRIME score: Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer), both using simulated substitutions and real somatic mutations in a large breast cancer cohort from TCGA and in the HeLa genome.</p>

<title>Training TF-specific enhancer classifiers to predict functional TF binding regions</title>
<p>Chromatin immuno-precipitation coupled with sequencing (ChIP–seq) allows identifying genome-wide locations of TF binding, however usually only a fraction of observed ChIP-seq peaks (0.9%-54.6%) are functional, in the sense of being actively involved in regulating target gene expression [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Here, we wanted to develop TF-specific enhancer models by training them only on <italic>functional</italic> target CRMs (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To identify such training sets of functional ChIP-seq peaks we searched for peaks that are located near up- or down-regulated genes in response to a perturbation of the TF, or that are located near tightly co-expressed target genes with the TF (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). To obtain statistically significant correlations between ChIP-seq data and co-expressed gene sets, we applied a procedure called “track discovery”, whereby ChIP-seq peak sets from ENCODE and other resources are tested for their enrichment on a gene set [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Particularly, we compared 344 sets of TF target genes against 1000 ChIP-seq tracks. This led to the identification of 45 sets of positive training CRMs for 41 distinct transcription factors, most of which are related to cancer. The average size of the training sets ranges between 6 (POU5F1) and 3901 (YY1) positive samples (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Overview of the methodology.</title>
<p>A) To identify functional CRMs we searched for significant correlations between TF ChIP-seq tracks and TF target genes using i-cisTarget [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; and selected peaks (marked in green) that are located in 20 kb regulatory space around up- or down-regulated TF target genes. B) Feature selection was performed on the set of functional CRMs to select TF and co-regulatory PWMs and data tracks. C) The performance of each of the 45 TF models was evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, using area under the precision-recall and receiver-operating characteristic curves. D) The 45 learned classifiers where used to identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory somatic mutations that have an impact on the CRM score, defining a PRIME score (Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer).</p>

</fig>
<p>For each set of positive CRMs we trained Random Forest (RF) classifiers each consisting of 151 decision trees that optimally distinguish the positive CRMs from sets of negative sequences. As negative sequences we used randomly sampled regions from the human genome with the same size and GC content as the positives, in a 1:20 ratio. We trained different types of RF models depending on the type of features used in the decision trees (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The first model, M1, uses ten motifs of the TF and ten motifs of co-regulatory TFs. These twenty motifs are selected by motif discovery on the training CRMs, out of a collection of nearly 10.000 candidate position weight matrices. The second model, M2, uses as features the fifteen most representative regulatory tracks: five open chromatin tracks, five active histone modification tracks, and five ChIP-seq tracks of potential co-regulatory TFs. Model M3 combines all features of M1 and M2, in total twenty motifs and fifteen tracks. Similarly to motif features, these tracks were selected by track discovery (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). To avoid over-fitting, ChIP-seq tracks of the query TF itself were excluded as candidate features. The performance of each of the 45 TF models (for the three different RF types) was evaluated using the area under the precision-recall (AuPR) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AuROC) curves, as achieved by the model in a five-fold cross-validation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We compared the performances to a baseline model (M0) that predicts TF targets by simple PWM-scanning using the PWM of the query TF; and to a previously published alternative classifier based on Support Vector Machines trained on k-mers (Mk) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Collectively, M1 (the RF classifiers utilising only motif information) achieved on average across the 45 datasets an AuPR of 0.62; similar to Mk (kmer-SVM: AuPR = 0.61), and both are much higher than M0 (PWM-only: 0.37). Note that we prefer the AuPR since the AuROC is less reliable for imbalanced training sets with high numbers of negative sequences [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The best performing M1 models are for SRF, GABPA, CEBPB, STAT2, and YY1. In total, thirty of the RF classifiers achieved an AuPR greater than 0.5 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Additional quality control and robustness analysis revealed that most models show stabilization of cross-validation performance (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>); that Random Forests outperform other machine-learning approaches on the same data such as Support Vector Machines or Logistic Regression (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs); and that the performance of the models does not depend on the size of the training set (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>) nor on the information content of the main PWM (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>) of the query TF.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the performance of M2 models that use data tracks instead of motifs. These models have drastically higher AuPRs than motif-based models (average AuPR = 0.87), with all 45 models having an AuPR above 0.5. For M2, the best performing models are for SRF, E2F4, JUNB, NFE2L2, and TP53. Interestingly, several TFs with ill-performing M1 models have a much improved AuPR score; for example TAL1 has an M1 model with AuPR = 0.13, whereas M2 with tracks achieves an AuPR of 0.69 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Finally, for combined models the performance increases even further, although not much beyond M2 (average AuPR = 0.9). Interestingly, TFs can be grouped into different classes, where each class has different types of features contributing to the classifier, as determined by Gini impurity (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). For 20/45 models, the TF PWMs contribute more than 20% of all features (e.g., TP53 in <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). For another class of 7/45 models the co-regulatory factor PWMs contribute more than 20% of all features and dominate over the TF PWMs (NANOG in <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>); and for 39/45 models the sum importance of the three data tracks groups was dominant providing more than 50% of the feature importance (e.g., MYC in <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Feature importance.</title>
<p>A) Three examples of TFs, each with several (for NANOG and TP53) or one (for MYC) target CRMs, illustrating the feature importance in the Random Forest classifier, in the M3 model. For NANOG co-regulatory PWMs contribute more to the classification performance than the PWM of NANOG itself. For TP53, the contribution of the co-regulatory PWMs is not strong and the classification decision is largely based on the presence of strong binding sites of TP53 itself. For the MYC model the most important features are regulatory tracks. B) Examples of a decision tree in the ensemble.

<p><xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> also shows an example decision tree from the ensemble for the TP53, NANOG, and MYC examples. By investigating the feature importance we can obtain more insight into the CRM code; for example that TCF12 and ATF2 tracks are important to predict NANOG targets; or that SIN3A ChIP-seq peaks in MCF-7 are important to predict MYC binding. Note that this does not mean that SIN3A and MYC necessarily co-bind in the same cell.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we trained multiple well performing models for the classification of TF-specific regulatory target regions. The results suggest that not all information in a CRM can be captured by TF and co-regulatory TF motifs. The track-based M3 models yield an upper-limit to the classification performance based on sequence/motif information alone. Ultimately however, to identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations (see further below), we will rely on sequence/motif-based models because those are generally applicable, as they do not depend on the availability of multiple regulatory tracks in the cancer and normal sample.</p>

<title>Genome-wide prediction of functional TF targets</title>
<p>To further validate our trained CRM classifers we applied them genome-wide to predict new functional TF target CRMs (including M1, M3, and Mk models). To this end, we split the genome into overlapping sliding windows with sizes corresponding to the average lengths of the sequences in the training set (ranging from 400 bp for NANOG to 2350 bp for GLI3, with an average of 900 bp). The number of newly predicted functional binding sites for M1 models ranges from several hundreds to several tens of thousands. To assess the accuracy of new predictions, we calculated the enrichment of the TF ChIP-seq peaks among newly predicted CRMs, excluding training CRMs. We found a significant recovery for 31 of the 45 models using a RF classifier with motifs only (M1). The five best performing models regarding genome-wide predictions, as measured by the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) given by i-cisTarget [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], are TP53 (NES = 31.1), IRF1 (NES = 21.5), STAT2 (NES = 17.45), POU5F1 (NES = 16.25), and SPI1 (NES = 14.15). Interestingly, although the cross-validation performances of the motif-only RF and k-mer SVM models were highly similar, the genome-wide prediction accuracies are overall much higher for the RF models (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Particularly, 31 of the 45 M1 models show significant recovery of the correct ChIP-seq peaks, compared to only 17 of the 45 Mk models (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). We also performed genome-wide predictions for M3 models, which incorporate regulatory data tracks as features in the model. Although the cross-validation performance of M3 models is much better than M1, the M3 models did not result in more TFs with high-confidence genome-wide scoring, since again 31 models show significant recovery of correct ChIP-seq peaks. This indicates that M1 models with motif-information alone are already very performant in genome-wide predictions, and this is confirmed by inspecting the correlation between the validation scores (i.e., TF track enrichment scores), being very high between M1 and M3 (0.876), while they are both better than Mk (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). We also analyzed whether predicted CRMs show enrichment for active chromatin marks, such as H3K27Ac. Indeed, for 26 to 40 models this is the case for M1 and M3 models respectively. More generally, for the majority of TFs (39/45 models) the newly predicted CRMs are enriched for regulatory active chromatin states, as determined by chromHMM segmentations [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] from ENCODE (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>), with the strongest models overlapping with promoter states being E2F1, TAF1, YY1, E2F7, and KLF5, and the strongest models overlapping with enhancer states being E2F7, TCF12, and FOSL1. In conclusion, we evaluated the quality of the TF-target classifiers in an alternative way, independent of cross-validation performances and found that most RF classifiers are enriched for ChIP-seq peaks of the query TF and active chromatin marks.</p>

<title>Using enhancer models to predict high-impact <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations</title>
<p>Whereas current methods for the prediction of changes in TF binding sites assess local changes in the actual TF binding site, for example using a change in the PWM score [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], here we wanted to assess whether TF-specific enhancer models allow identifying <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations that have an impact on the global CRM score. Firstly, we simulated mutations by creating substitutions in gene promoters. Particularly, we selected the 900 bp promoter of 752 curated cancer driver genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and changed at each position the sequence into each of the three alternative nucleotides. To measure the impact of each possible single nucleotide variation (SNV) we introduce a score, called PRIME, that is calculated as the difference between the RF classifier scores for mutant and reference sequences. PRIME values range between -1.0 to 1.0 and allow capturing both gains and losses of CRM function. To evaluate the quality of PRIME, we hypothesized that nucleotides with higher PRIME scores should be more conserved. Indeed, nucleotides tend to be under higher constraint with increasing absolute PRIME score (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). There is one caveat to this analysis however: low PRIME scores can represent a mixture of sites that are not bound by either allele, and bound sites where the variant does not change binding. To distinguish between these, we simulated substitutions inside ChIP-peaks (true sites) versus substitutions outside ChIP-peaks (not bound by either allele) in terms of conservation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). The results demonstrate that although nucleotides belonging to real binding sites tend to be more conserved with increasing PRIME score, also high-scoring mutations outside ChIP peaks are enriched for high phastCons scores. We performed a similar validation experiment using open chromatin data and found that substitutions with high PRIME score tend to be more located in accessible regions than low PRIME substitutions, suggesting their potential involvement in CRM function (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). As an example, we show in <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> the promoter of the <italic>E2F1</italic> gene, where the E2F4 model identifies a hotspot of high PRIME substitutions. Convincingly, these positions overlap with the summit of an E2F4 ChIP-seq peak and cover the entire E2F4 consensus site. We expected an increased specificity (rather than sensitivity) of mutation detection with Random Forest models (M1) compared to the simple PWM model (M0), because PWMs are known to suffer from high false positive rates [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To test whether this is indeed the case for the <italic>E2F1</italic> promoter, we scored all possible substitutions in this promoter with several E2F4 PWMs, and indeed found many non-functional positions that show a change in PWM score (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). This suggests that random forest classifiers are better suited to detect <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation than PWMs.</p>

<p>We then scored a large collection of real non-coding somatic mutations collected from three cancer whole genome sequencing studies: 50 AML samples (N = 19797) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 21 breast cancer samples (N = 183703) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and 25 melanoma samples (N = 1875157) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly to the simulated substitutions, we found that predicted high-impact mutations are more conserved than mutations with low predicted regulatory impact (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref>). Also, mutations with high absolute PRIME score (greater than 0.4) are enriched for chromatin states corresponding to functional regulatory elements such as active promoters, weak promoters, and strong enhancers (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>). When compared to measuring the impact of a mutation by the change in PWM score, also on this set we find that the Random Forest models show greater specificity than PWMs (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Previously known driver mutations in the <italic>TAL1</italic> enhancer are predicted as high-impact <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations</title>
<p>To test whether the Random Forest CRM models may be suitable to identify cancer driver mutations we examined in detail a recently published <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutation in the <italic>TAL1</italic> promoter in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Particularly, a recurrent (5.5% of patient T-ALL samples) mutation is caused by a short insertion that creates one or two <italic>de novo</italic> binding sites (depending on the length of the insertion) for the MYB transcription factor, a well-known regulator involved in T-ALL. Our 45 models do not contain a MYB-specific model (only a MYBL2 model), and none of the 45 models predicted a high PRIME score for this site. However, when we trained a MYB-specific M1 model, using MYB target CRMs as training set (obtained by anti-MYB ChIP-seq in the Jurkat T-ALL cell line [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]), the <italic>TAL1</italic> mutation yields a very high PRIME score (from 0.054 in the reference to 0.3774 in the mutated CRM). Thus, only the MYB model identifies this gain-of-function mutation. In contrast, when we used the PWM for MYB, which yields an increase in PWM score of 0.1 for the actual driver mutation compared to reference (from 0.844 to 0.949), we also find two other PWMs of the 45 tested M0 models (GABPA and CEBPB) that yield a similar PWM score increase (more than 0.1) and that have a high PWM score (&gt;0.9) for the mutant sequence. In other words, although the MYB PWM can identify the mutation, it is also falsely predicted by other PWMs, but not by other Random Forest models.</p>
<p>For a MYB model to prioritize this mutation in the genome, out of all possible somatic mutations, the model also needs to be specific. To test this, we scored a large set of control somatic mutations (both SNVs and insertions) with the same MYB model (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). These control mutations were selected from breast cancer somatic mutations from TCGA. Since MYB is not known to be involved in breast cancer, we could argue that each mutation with a high PRIME score for the MYB model would be a false positive prediction. This analysis shows a remarkable specificity, with only 2/19796 SNVs and 0/7323 insertions predicted as high-impact mutation for MYB (PRIME&gt;0.3). For comparison, using the MYB PWM identifies 179 SNVs and 354 insertions with a delta of 0.1 or more in the control set. For the <italic>TAL1</italic> promoter mutation we can conclude that the predicted high impact corroborates the gain of CRM activity observed in the Jurkat cell line that harbors this mutation, as measured by H3K27ac (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>The empirical distribution of background PRIME scores for the MYB model allows estimating the significance of this PRIME score using a z-score (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), which is 26.5 for the Jurkat insertion. A similar but shorter insertion was found in the MOLT-3 cell line and in several patient samples; these insertions generate only one new MYB binding site and yield z-scores between 1.41 and 21.45 for the MYB model. Note that we used these thresholds based on the MOLT-3 insertion, determined from the empirical distribution of PRIMEs for SNVs or insertions thresholds (9.65 and 14.03, respectively) to determine model-specific PRIME thresholds for other models, further below.</p>
<p>To investigate why the Random Forest model for MYB achieves such high specificity compared to the PWM, we analysed the feature importance within the MYB model and found that both MYB motifs and co-regulatory TF motifs contribute significantly to the classification decision. Interestingly, the most important co-regulatory motif is RUNX, a known co-regulatory factor of MYB (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The combination of MYB motif clusters and co-regulatory motifs allows assessing the impact of a mutation taking the context of a CRM into account. To illustrate this, we tested whether inserting exactly the same sequence at random position does not always produce a similar gain of function. Indeed, when we inserted the same sequence into 100 randomly chosen genomic loci having the same 3 bp flanking nucleotides we found that the PRIME score strongly depends on the surrounding sequence context. For example, the Jurkat insertion generates a PRIME score equal or higher than 0.32 (the observed PRIME in the <italic>TAL1</italic> enhancer) in only 10/100 locations, indicating that most genomic locations are not susceptible to this insertion, in terms of MYB-dependent activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We also performed this analysis for another well-known promoter mutation, in the <italic>TERT</italic> promoter. The <italic>TERT</italic> promoter harbors two recurrent mutations and these are among the highest recurring mutations in cancer (between 33% and 85% in melanoma [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). The original articles reporting this mutation suggested that this mutation generates an ETS-like binding site (GGAA) and that ETS family members might cause an up-regulation of the <italic>TERT</italic> gene due to this gain of function binding site mutation. More recently, these mutations were linked to <italic>de novo</italic> binding by GABPA, which also binds to a GGAA motif [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, our GABPA model did not result in a significant PRIME score (PRIME = 0.026; Z-score = 0.99). We constructed four alternative models for different ETS-like factors using their respective top ChIP-peaks as training set (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), namely ELF1, ELK1, ELK4, and ETS1. For two of these models, namely for the EFL1 and the ELK1 model, we found significant PRIME scores (z-score = 2.83 and 6.49, respectively), although the PRIME score was much lower than for the <italic>TAL1</italic> mutation (the highest PRIME is 0.097 for ELK1 = &gt;<italic>TERT</italic>, compared to 0.32 for MYB = &gt;<italic>TAL1</italic>). Remarkably, looking at promoter activity data by H3K27Ac, across a cohort of melanoma samples we generated before [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], we could not observe any gain of activity in the samples that harbor the mutation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). We can conclude for the <italic>TERT</italic> promoter that the predicted impact scores are significant but modest and that they corroborate with low observed impact at the promoter activity level.</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations linked to gene expression and chromatin activity</title>
<p>Next we used the TF-specific random forest models to prioritize <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations in 498 re-sequenced breast cancer genomes from TCGA, for which gene expression data is available [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We specifically scored all SNVs and insertions located in promoters (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). To evaluate whether mutations with high PRIME scores could have a functional impact on gene expression, we evaluated the expression level of the target gene in the sample with the mutated promoter, compared to all other samples (using z-scores). Indeed, this shows a clear association of changes in gene expression with predicted impact of promoter mutations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the median absolute z-score values of gene expression increases with increasing PRIME score. When we focused on promoters of cancer related genes (the list of 752 curated cancer driver genes), we found only 36 genes having single nucleotide mutations with absolute PRIME score &gt; 0.3 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Using the model-specific z-scores (with a cutoff of 9.65 for SNVs and 14.03 for insertions), 84 genes are found with significant mutations. When we applied our models to small insertions in promoters, we found only three high impact insertions, namely in the <italic>SOX9</italic> promoter (gain for E2F1), the <italic>METTL14</italic> promoter (YY1 loss), and the <italic>NLGN2</italic> promoter (PAX5 gain). Interestingly, two of these three mutations are recurrently mutated across the TCGA cohort (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Expanding our search to 10 kb, and focusing only on breast-cancer related transcription factors as targets (along the lines of the MYB-<italic>TAL1</italic> gain), we found an additional 91 SNVs and 11 insertions with high impact (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s027" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), including a gain of TP53 CRM upstream of <italic>SOX5</italic>, and a loss of a SIX5 site upstream of <italic>NR3C1</italic>. Interestingly, these two latter insertions are recurrent across the TCGA cohort (39 and 59 samples, respectively). Furthermore, expression of <italic>SOX5</italic> target gene is significantly higher in the samples with the insertion, compared to the samples without the insertion (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Overall, we thus found a limited number of potentially harmful <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations, given that in <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> we pooled together all the results across 498 breast cancer genomes.</p>

<p>Finally, we reasoned that if a mutation really causes a gain of CRM activity, this should be directly visible as a change in chromatin activity, such as increased chromatin accessibility, increased H3K27Ac signal, or decreased DNA methylation. Unfortunately, none of these data are available at the genome-wide level for the TCGA cohort (DNA methylation is currently available for 450K probes, which is too sparse for our low number of high-impact mutations). To test a potential correlation between mutations with high PRIME scores and chromatin, we therefore used the HeLa genome [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], for which H3K27Ac data is available from ENCODE (GSM733684) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Scoring all 13923 small insertions located in 10 kb regulatory space around TSS of the HeLa genome, for our 45 models, we found 141 variations with significantly high PRIME scores, based on the model-specific z-scores (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S17 Fig</xref>). A small subset of these are indeed located in regions with H3K27Ac signal that is specific, or semi-specific for the HeLa cell line (compared to H3K27Ac data for 108 other samples, see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), possibly indicating that these mutations have a local effect on the activity of the enhancer (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). To test whether any particular TF has more mutated CRMs, we compared the amount of gains and losses for each TF model stratified on whether the variation is a known polymorphism from dbSNP or not, the latter representing possibly somatic mutations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). Interestingly, this shows that oncogenic TFs that are important for HeLa, namely MYC, E2F7, JUND, and STAT1, have more gains than losses, specifically for variations not in dbSNP. Vice versa, YY1, a known repressor related to cancer, has almost no gains in non-dbSNP variations, while dbSNP variations have an almost equal amount of gains and losses. We believe that such skews towards “relevant TFs” strongly indicate a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effect for this group of mutations. AP-1 (JUN/FOS dimer) is indeed a relevant factor for HeLa, because it is the most enriched motif and track among all the HeLa-specific H3K27Ac peaks (AP-1 motif rank = 1, NES = 7.36; FOS ChIP-seq NES = 7.20). A clear example of a SNP with a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effect is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>, where a heterozygous SNP that is predicted to generate a gain in JUN binding (PRIME = 0.21; z-score = 16.28), indeed shows a gain of JUN binding in the HeLa ChIP-seq data for JUN (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>). All the reads in the JUN ChIP-seq peak contain the alternative (non-reference) allele, which generates an AP-1 binding site in a favorable CRM context. Note that compared to the MYB-<italic>TAL1</italic> interaction (see above), which generates a <italic>de novo</italic> super-enhancer that is unique to the Jurkat and MOLT-3 samples, for the HeLa genome we did not identify such strong effects in H3K27ac gains. Indeed, only four insertions are located in a H3K27Ac peak that is unique to HeLa. One of these four has an absolute PRIME score close to 0.3 (-0.295) (i.e., observed frequency is 0.25). Interestingly, this predicted mutation is located near <italic>CDH10</italic>, a gene that is specifically expressed in HeLa, compared to other cell types of the human body map, as determined by Landry et al.

<p>A) Scatter plot of PRIME scores (45 M1 models) for heterozygous SNVs in the HeLa cell line versus z-scores of H3K27Ac peak scores (the higher the z-score the more exclusive the H3K27Ac signal to Hela, compared to 108 other samples). The arrow indicates an example SNV that generates a <italic>de novo</italic> JUN binding site (shown in C-D). B) Using high-scoring SNVs falling in acetylation peaks for each TF model we plotted fractions of gains and losses in dbSNP (polymorphisms) versus not in dbSNP (possibly somatic mutations). Oncogenic TFs that are important for HeLa, namely MYC, E2F7, JUND, and STAT1, have more gains than losses, specifically for variations not in dbSNP. <italic>Vice versa</italic>, YY1, a known repressor related to cancer, has almost no gains in non-dbSNP variations, while dbSNP variations have an almost equal amount of gains and losses. C) H3K27Ac signal around SNP that is predicted to generate a gain in JUN binding (PRIME = 0.21; z-score = 16.28) indeed shows a moderate exclusivity of H3K27Ac to HeLa. D) This position shows an allele-specific binding of JUN, only having ChIP-seq reads with the variant allele that causes a gain in JUN binding sites.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Whole genome sequencing of cancer samples has revealed that cancer genomes harbour thousands to hundreds of thousands of non-coding mutations. Sifting through all these mutations to identify mutations that contribute to the oncogenic process is a key challenge in cancer genomics, as it is yet unclear to what extent regulatory mutations can be actual driver mutations. For coding mutations, driver mutations are usually identified by their significant recurrence across a patient cohort. For example, <italic>TP53</italic> is mutated in 37% of breast cancer samples in the TCGA and Sanger cohorts [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus far, although non-coding mutations are more numerous than coding mutations, very few recurrent <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations have been found, and recent pan-cancer analyses concluded that in fact only one potential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutation, in the <italic>TERT</italic> promoter is highly recurrent [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations have been identified in 6 of 14 cancer types where they occur in 3 to 62% of cancer samples, depending on the type of cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. They are associated with higher expression of <italic>TERT</italic>, both in promoter-luciferase assays [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and in patient samples [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Because these mutations generate GGAA sites, it was hypothesized that this could lead to increased activation by TFs of the ETS-family, which recognize GGAA consensus sites. Recently, it was shown that the TF is in fact GABPA. While the <italic>TERT</italic> mutation has relatively low PRIME scores and no gain of H3K27Ac, the <italic>TAL1</italic> promoter mutation, which generates a <italic>de novo</italic> MYB binding site, causes neomorphic/ectopic enhancer activity as seen by a very strong and broad H3K27Ac signal spanning a large region encompassing the mutation. Interestingly, our enhancer models for MYB predict the <italic>TAL1</italic> mutation as a high-impact mutation.</p>
<p>We have applied CRM prediction methods to the reference genome and to cancer genomes, and calculated the differential CRM score between the reference sequence and the sequence carrying a single nucleotide variant or a small insertion. CRM prediction methods are computational techniques to predict regulatory regions (e.g., promoters, enhancers) based on their sequence content and usually take advantage of transcription factor motifs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whereas CRM prediction methods have often been applied to identify tissue-specific enhancers (e.g., human heart enhancers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Drosophila tissue-specific enhancers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], etc.), their application to identify TF-specific target CRMs is relatively limited [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Here we specifically train models on training sets of <italic>functional</italic> TF ChIP-seq peaks. We define functional peaks as the signficant subset (or “leading edge” [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) of peaks that are located near genes that are up- or down-regulated upon perturbation of the TF. Compared to previous methods that often rely on k-mers, Markov chains, or <italic>de novo</italic> discovered motifs in the training set [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we have here assessed the power of using large PWM collections. Since we know (to a large extent) the identity of the TF for each PWM, this strategy allows selecting a set (we choose 10) of specific PWMs for the query TF, and a set of PWMs for potential co-regulatory TFs. We furthermore believe that the power of using PWMs for CRM predictions will further increase, given the recent progress in high-throughput determination of TF binding specificities [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that for a subset of TFs the co-regulatory transcription factor motifs have a higher feature importance than the motifs of the query TF itself. An important example of this category is the cancer-related TF FOXM1, which requires a Random Forest model with co-regulatory factor motifs to identify FOXM1 targets in the genome. This is also corroborated by the fact that FOXM1 ChIP-seq peaks are not enriched for any FOXM1 motif [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, when potential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations are scored for their potential motif-breaking or motif-making effects, using the FOXM1 motif would render meaningless results.</p>
<p>As an alternative we have also trained CRM models using regulatory data as features, such as histone modifications and chromatin accessibility. Corroborating previous work by others [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], such models have a higher performance compared to sequence-based prediction methods. This likely implies that CRM function/output cannot entirely be captured by sequence and motif content of the CRM itself. In this respect, we consider the models using experimental regulatory data to represent an upper limit to the CRM prediction problem. Although for some TFs the sequence-based models reach an accuracy close to their respective data-based model, the performance of most TF models is still far from perfect (15 TFs with AuPR&lt;0.5). To evaluate our models and to compare different approaches we used standard cross-validation. Importantly however, we included a complementary evaluation approach, namely the genome-wide prediction of CRMs. We then tested the performance of each model by assessing the overlap between predicted TF-specific CRMs and TF ChIP-peaks, excluding the ChIP-peaks used in the training set. This allowed to functionally validate our predictions, and to compare our models with alternative modelling approaches (namely, a simple PWM, a k-mer SVM approach, and a gapped k-mer SVM), showing that Random Forest classifiers outperformed these alternative methods (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S19</xref> Figs). In addition, this experiment showed that the predicted CRMs using sequence-based models represent regions with typical characteristics for CRMs, such as cross-species conservation and enhancer/promoter-related chromatin states, including DNAse I hypersensitivity and H3K27Ac enrichment.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the high CRM prediction performance, we then applied the optimized TF-specific CRM models to mutated cancer genomes, to predict <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations with potential impact on CRM function. Using thresholds of the PRIME score based on a z-score, which is calculated on a TF model-specific empirical distribution, by scoring that model on 20000 variants from TCGA; we found relatively few mutations, with only 0.1%– 1.2% high impact mutations with PRIME&gt;0.3 (comparable to the MYB-<italic>TAL1</italic> mutation) per cancer genome, on average. This was true for the large TCGA breast cancer cohort, but also for smaller cohorts of melanoma (25), another breast cancer (21), and AML (50) genomes. Nevertheless, the high-scoring mutations, as well as simulated substitutions we introduced in promoters of cancer genes, overlap significantly with conserved nucleotides and with enhancer/promoter chromatin states, indicating that these predictions are valuable. The low number of high-impact mutations was again confirmed when we scored insertions found in the HeLa genome (scoring 10 kb regions around TSS) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], where we found only one insertion (near <italic>CDH10</italic>) with high impact and associated with a gain in H3K27Ac signal (as the reported insertion in the <italic>TAL1</italic> enhancer). Note that although the thresholds we have applied to PRIME scores are based on model-specific z-scores, the stringent z-score cutoffs are largely inspired by the TAL1 examplars, and could be fine-tuned or relaxed in the future if more experimentally validated cis-regulatory mutations are discovered. Another reason why we identify few mutations may be partly due to the limited number of models we have built (currently 45; with an additional nine models specifically added for the HeLa genome), but we speculate that even with more models, the total number of high impact <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations will be low. This is indeed corroborated with the low number of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations that are found to be recurrent across cancer samples [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Importantly, when PWMs are used to score <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations, more than 100-fold excess of false-positives are predicted. This is mostly due to the context of the CRM, for example, when multiple binding sites of the same factor are present in a CRM (i.e., a homotypic cluster [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]), adding or deleting a single binding site may not have any dramatic effect on the CRM. This is measured in the first layer by the CRM score, but not by the individual PWM scores. In a second layer, different features are combined via optimized parameters in an ensemble of decision trees, further increasing the specificity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S20 Fig</xref>). Recently, a similar method was published, called deltaSVM [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which also uses a machine-learning approach to train a model and score reference and variant sequence, to calculate a delta score. Although deltaSVM was mainly applied to GWAS data to score natural variation, it could in principle also be applied to cancer mutations. This method is complementary to our Random Forest models because it is trained on a different type of training set (all open chromatin regions of a sample, rather than TF-specific models) and it uses entirely different features (k-mers for the deltaSVM, compared to PWMs and data tracks for our PRIME scores). Therefore these two approaches are complemenatary and both can predict the impact of mutations in an enhancer, as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S21 Fig</xref>, on a data set of synthetic enhancer sequences. Nevertheless, since our RF models are often more specific in genome-wide scorings, they may also yield less false-positive predictions on genomic variation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S22 Fig</xref>). A future challenge will be to use M3 models to score mutations, incorporating epigenomic data tracks into the model. To this end however, besides a fully re-sequenced cancer genome and germline control, also a cancer and control epigenome would be required. As an alternative, if full genomes can be phased into haplotypes, M3 models could be exploited to score the allele-specific impact of heterozygous variants.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we presented an approach to model <italic>CRM context</italic> allowing to predict and prioritize candidate <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations in cancer genomes that could affect CRM function, and provide a solution to the excess of false-positive predictions obtained by approaches using position weight matrices. Our predictions on cancer genomes furthermore suggest that the majority of non-coding mutations may be passenger mutations, and that only few top-scoring mutations may contribute to the oncogenic program as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory drivers.</p>

<title>Identification of a subset of functional ChIP-peaks</title>
<p>For each target gene set we performed “track discovery” using i-cisTarget [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], on all available TF ChIP-seq tracks. If the corresponding TF ChIP-seq track was significantly enriched, the leading edge was selected as optimal target CRMs. As parameters of i-cisTarget we used a search space size of 20 kb around TSS. For four TFs (E2F1, FOXM1, ESRRA, MYC) we found two different studies that provided a target gene set for this TF and for which i-cisTarget found the ChIP-seq of the factor enriched, thus for which we could identify a training set of functional target CRMs. These models are named as E2F1_2, FOXM1_2, ESRRA_2, MYC_2.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Feature selection</title>
<p>To select DNA motifs and regulatory tracks enriched in the set of training CRMs we again used i-cisTarget, but now using regions as input. i-cisTarget uses a large collection of motifs (9,713 PWMs) and human regulatory tracks (2,046) derived from different resources [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Two groups of motifs where selected: the top ten enriched motifs of the query TF and the top ten motifs of co-regulatory TFs. In addition, for M2 and M3 models, three groups of the most representative regulatory tracks were selected: up to five open chromatin tracks, five histone modification tracks (active marks), and five ChIP-seq tracks of potential co-regulatory TFs selecting only enriched tracks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Cross-validation</title>
<p>We performed 5-fold cross-validation. The selection of features using i-cisTarget was performed only once, on the entire training set. This does not affect the cross-validation performance because this filtering step is performed in an unsupervised way (without using the negative samples) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We confirmed this by performing i-cisTarget on every fold, without using the left-out samples, thereby using different features during each fold, but as expected this had no influence on the the AuPR values for cross-validation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S23 Fig</xref>). Note that for small training sets (e.g., POU2F1 has only 6 positive CRMs in the training set, the 5-fold cross-validation leaves out only 1 or 2 samples, thus making it more a leave-one-out cross-validation.</p>

<sec id="sec015">
<title>Feature-vector representation of the DNA sequence and Random Forest</title>
<p>Selected enriched PWMs and tracks were used for numerical representation of the DNA regions. For the motif scores we used Cluster-Buster (with default parameters except option -c was set to zero to obtain a score for every sequence) employing a Hidden Markov Model to score CRM sequences for clusters of binding sites [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We consider the PWMs as features and for each PWM we calculate on a CRM (which is a sample, so positive or negative) the total Cluster-Buster motif-cluster score for that PWM. This means that for each feature (PWM) we have one score per CRM (so per window). The final M1 models thus contain only 20 features, and each region’s feature vector contains 20 Cluster-Buster scores. For M2 and M3 models we also include data tracks as features. For their scores we assigned the maximum score of broad or narrow peaks (corresponds to signalValue column in the bed file format) overlapping with the scoring region (the overlap was obtained using BEDtools [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]). As negatives we used 20x more sequences, randomly selected from the genome without restriction on genomic locations, with the same length and GC distribution as the positives. As Random Forest implementation we used the scikit-learn Python package [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] 151 decision trees were used for each classifier. Changing the number of trees can be indicative of the stabilisation of the cross-validation performance (<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The parameter max_features (responsible for number of features to consider when looking for the best split) was set to sqrt(number of features). To calculate the feature importance we used the Gini impurity criterion averaged across trees, using the whole training data, again with the implementation from scikit-learn library [<xref rid="pcbi.1004590.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p>

The performance of the Mk, Mgk, M1, M2, M3 models where evaluated in 5-fold cross-validation. To evaluate performance of the M0 we obtained AuROC and AuPR curves varying the motif score threshold.

<title>Comparison of genome-wide scoring results between models.</title>
<p>Correlation of the TF ChIP-seq peak enrichment scores for genome wide predictions obtained with Mk, M1, M3 models. Random forest models (M1 and M3) utilizing various set of features show high agreement with each other (r = 0.876) and both models are less correlated with the TF ChIP-seq peak enrichment of predictions obtained with Mk. This demonstrates that for the same TFs both RF classifiers (M1 and M3) have similar enrichment of the corresponding ChIP-seq peaks in the newly predicted CRMs. Diagonal shows density profile of the enrichment scores for each of the 45 models from M1, M3 and Mk.</p>
