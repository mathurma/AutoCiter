<article-title>Cell Fate-Decision as High-Dimensional Critical State Transition</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>In some recent studies, a view emerged that stochastic dynamics governing the switching of cells from one differentiation state to another could be characterized by a peak in gene expression variability at the point of fate commitment. We have tested this hypothesis at the single-cell level by analyzing primary chicken erythroid progenitors through their differentiation process and measuring the expression of selected genes at six sequential time-points after induction of differentiation. In contrast to population-based expression data, single-cell gene expression data revealed a high cell-to-cell variability, which was masked by averaging. We were able to show that the correlation network was a very dynamical entity and that a subgroup of genes tend to follow the predictions from the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory. In addition, we also identified a small group of functionally related genes encoding proteins involved in sterol synthesis that could act as the initial drivers of the differentiation. In order to assess quantitatively the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression and its evolution in time, we used Shannon entropy as a measure of the heterogeneity. Entropy values showed a significant increase in the first 8 h of the differentiation process, reaching a peak between 8 and 24 h, before decreasing to significantly lower values. Moreover, we observed that the previous point of maximum entropy precedes two paramount key points: an irreversible commitment to differentiation between 24 and 48 h followed by a significant increase in cell size variability at 48 h. In conclusion, when analyzed at the single cell level, the differentiation process looks very different from its classical population average view. New observables (like entropy) can be computed, the behavior of which is fully compatible with the idea that differentiation is not a “simple” program that all cells execute identically but results from the dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The differentiation process has classically been seen as a stereotyped program leading from one progenitor toward a functional cell. This vision was based upon cell population-based analyses averaged over millions of cells. However, new methods have recently emerged that allow interrogation of the molecular content at the single-cell level, challenging this view with a new model suggesting that cell-to-cell gene expression stochasticity could play a key role in differentiation. We took advantage of a physiologically relevant avian cellular model to analyze the expression level of 92 genes in individual cells collected at several time-points during differentiation. We first observed that the process analyzed at the single-cell level is very different and much less well ordered than the population-based average view. Furthermore, we showed that cell-to-cell variability in gene expression peaks transiently before strongly decreasing. This rise in variability precedes two key events: an irreversible commitment to differentiation, followed by a significant increase in cell size variability. Altogether, our results support the idea that differentiation is not a “simple” series of well-ordered molecular events executed identically by all cells in a population but likely results from dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The classical view of a linear differentiation process driven by the sequential activation of master regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref001">1</xref>] has been increasingly challenged in the last few years both by experimental findings and theoretical considerations.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent development in single-cell profiling technologies, researchers are now able to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression in more detail. In this context, several experimental studies at single-cell level involving the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation processes in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref008">8</xref>] and the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref009">9</xref>] have shown that gene expression variability might be involved in cell differentiation. To support this claim, recent researches on hematopoietic stem cells highlighted the role of molecular heterogeneity in differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref011">11</xref>]. Further evidence was also obtained during an ex vivo differentiation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref012">12</xref>], and in the generation of cells of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The overt cell-to-cell variability is deeply rooted in the inherent stochasticity of the gene expression process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref023">23</xref>]. Numerous explanations have been put forward regarding the molecular and cellular sources for such variability (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref024">24</xref>] and references therein). Some of those causes involve biophysical processes (e.g., the random partitioning during mitosis, as discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref025">25</xref>]), whereas others are more related to biochemical regulation (e.g., the dynamical functioning of the intracellular network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref026">26</xref>] or the chromatin dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref027">27</xref>]).</p>
<p>At least three models of cell differentiation based on stochastic gene expression have been proposed, in which a peak in the gene expression variability is expected to occur. In the first model, stochastic gene expression is the driving force of cell differentiation that generates cell type diversity, on which a selective constraint is then exerted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref028">28</xref>]. In the second model, noise in gene expression causes bifurcations in the dynamics of gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref021">21</xref>]. In the third model, cell differentiation is viewed as a dynamical process in which differentiating cells are thought of as particles moving around in a state space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref030">30</xref>]. This formal space can be used to display gene expression patterns. Hence, when some parameters that describe gene regulatory interactions change, the cell particle “moves” in the state space. In this view, discrete identified cell states (e.g., self-renewing, differentiated) correspond to different regions of this space that could be seen as different attractor states. The transition process between attractors therefore first requires the exit from the original state that may be fueled by an increase in gene expression stochasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref031">31</xref>]. Regardless of the differences between these models, they all assume that the differentiation process is represented by cell trajectories leading from one state to another through a phase of biased random walk in gene expression. This phase is followed by stabilization (convergence) toward a particular pattern of gene expression corresponding to a stable attractor state, the differentiated final state, in which noisy fluctuations of gene expression is minimized by the stabilizing effect of the attractor. Therefore, changes in the extent of cell-cell variability could be a new observable metric to characterize the cell differentiation process.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was then to assess whether gene expression variability changes during the differentiation process, as suggested by the above-quoted models, and whether such variation concurs with any physiological cellular change. We investigated the extent of gene expression variability at the single-cell level, both before and during the cell differentiation process. To do this, we analyzed the differentiation process of T2EC, which is an original cellular system consisting of non-genetically modified avian erythrocytic progenitor cells grown from a primary culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref032">32</xref>]. These cells can be maintained ex vivo in a self-renewal state under a combination of growth factors (TGF-<italic>α</italic>, TGF-<italic>β</italic>, and dexamethasone) and can also be induced to differentiate exclusively toward erythrocytes by changing the combination of the external factors present in the medium. The primary cause for differentiation is therefore known and relies upon change in the information carried by the extracellular environment. The differentiation process in those cells has been previously analyzed at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>We first selected a pool of 110 relevant genes on the basis of RNA-Seq analysis performed on populations of T2EC in self-renewal state or induced to differentiate for 48 h. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data allowed us to select 92 genes for further analysis. We then performed high-throughput reverse transcription followed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of the 92 selected genes on single-cells collected at six time-points of differentiation. Several dimensionality reduction algorithms were used to visualize trends in the datasets. In agreement with the above hypothesis, cell heterogeneity, as measured by entropy, significantly increased during the first hours of the differentiation process and reached a maximal value at 8 to 24 h before decreasing toward the end of the process. The peak in entropy preceded an increase in cell size variability at 48 h. These observations suggested that 24 h is a crucial turning point in the erythrocytic differentiation process, which was experimentally verified by showing that T2EC committed irreversibly to the differentiation process between 24 h and 48 h.</p>

<title>Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes Between Self-Renewing and Differentiating Progenitors</title>
<p>In order to identify a pool of genes potentially relevant in the differentiation process, we analyzed the transcriptome of self-renewing and differentiating primary chicken erythrocytic progenitor cells (T2EC) using RNA-Seq. We sequenced two independent libraries from self-renewing T2EC and two independent libraries from T2EC induced to differentiate for 48 h. For each condition, we first verified that read counts between replicates were reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). We then identified 424 significantly differentially expressed genes (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Gene ontology analysis using the DAVID database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref060">60</xref>] revealed a clear over-representation of genes involved in sterol biosynthesis in this list (not shown). This finding was in line with our previous analysis showing that the oxydosqualene cyclase (OSC), which is involved in cholesterol synthesis, is required to maintain self-renewal in T2EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref035">35</xref>]. However, no other over-represented function emerged from the present analysis.</p>

<title>Identification of Genes Relevant to Analyze the Erythrocytic Differentiation Process</title>
<p>To identify a smaller subset of relevant genes for further analysis by RT-qPCR using the Fluidigm array (see below), we tested 56 down-regulated and 77 up-regulated genes among the above 424 genes differentially expressed in self-renewing versus differentiating cells, which had the smallest set of <italic>p</italic>-values. We also included 32 non-regulated genes, selected among the most invariant ones. We then measured the expression of these 165 genes first using RNA from bulk cell populations taken at five time-points during differentiation (0, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h). Based on qPCR primer efficiency, 55 genes were removed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref>), which left a total of 110 genes for the subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>A principal component analysis (PCA) on the bulk gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) showed a clear separation of the time-point 0 h (self-renewal) from the differentiation time-points. Samples along the differentiation process were well ordered according to the first principal component (PC1). PC1 explained 56.2% of the data variability suggesting that the differentiation process is the main source of variability at the population level for the selected genes.</p>

<title>Analysis of bulk-cell gene expression during the differentiation process.</title>
<p>Gene expression data were produced by RT-qPCR in triplicate from three independent T2EC populations collected at five differentiation time-points (0 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h). The expression level of 110 genes (18 invariants, 50 down-regulated and 42 up-regulated) was analyzed by two different multivariate statistical methods: (A) Principal component analysis (PCA), and (B) Dendogram resulting from hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The dots in (A) and leaves in (B) indicate the different cell populations and the colors indicate the differentiation time-points at which they were collected.</p>

</fig>
<p>We also performed a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), which again showed a clear arrangement of the samples according to their position along the differentiation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We further noticed that the gene expression patterns at 0, 8, and 24 h time-points were more similar to each other, while those at 48 h and 72 h time-points were also more similar to each other.</p>
<p>Thus, the 110 selected genes allowed us to clearly distinguish cell populations according to their progression along the differentiation sequence, indicating that they were relevant for analyzing this process. However, since the single-cell measurement technology used in this study could only accommodate 92 genes (not including two spikes and two repeats for the <italic>RPL22L1</italic> gene), we further refined our gene choice by performing a K-means clustering on the above data. The algorithm grouped genes based on their expression profile, and identified seven different gene clusters with respect to expression kinetics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The patterns mainly showed decreasing or increasing gene expressions during the differentiation process, while one cluster displayed a more complex dynamic (cluster 4). The latter was composed of genes whose expression decreased during the first 8 h, then increased and stabilized between 24 h and 48 h, before decreasing again until 72 h. Interestingly, all genes belonging to this cluster were linked by their involvement in sterol biosynthesis, reinforcing the previously noted role of this pathway in erythroid differentiation. Based on the result of K-means clustering, we selected around thirteen genes per group to represent each cluster equally. This left us with 92 genes for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s010">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>We then used STRING database to search for known connections among these genes. The result confirmed the existence of a strongly connected subnetwork associated with sterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Moreover, this analysis also revealed the presence of another highly connected subnetwork mostly composed of genes involved in signaling cascades and two transcription factors (BATF and RUNX2). Those two main networks are linked by the gene <italic>HSP90AA1</italic> which encodes the molecular chaperone HSP90<italic>alpha</italic>. Its activity is not only involved in stress response but also in many different molecular and biological processes because of its important interactome.

<title>Cell-to-Cell Heterogeneity Blurred Cell Differentiation Process</title>
<p>We measured the expression level of the selected 92 genes by single-cell RT-qPCR using 96 cells isolated from the most informative time-points of the differentiation sequence. Based upon preliminary experiments, we decided to analyze cells from six time-points during differentiation. After data cleaning (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref>), we obtained the expression level of 90 genes in 55, 73, 72, 70, 68, and 51 single cells from 0, 8, 24, 33, 48, and 72 h of differentiation, respectively.</p>
<p>One should note that the variability we observed at the single-cell level originates from two types of sources: biological sources and experimental sources. We therefore tested the technical reproducibility of different RT-qPCR steps liable to generate such experimental noise (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref>). As expected, reverse transcription (RT) was the main source of experimental variability, since pre-amplification and qPCR steps brought negligible amount of variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Moreover, using external RNA spikes controls whose Cq value depends only on the experimental procedure, we noted that technical variability was negligible compared to the biological variability (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref>). Quality control (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref>) led to the elimination of 2 genes, letting us with 90 genes for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>We first used PCA on the single-cell expression of these 90 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast to the whole-population data, the single-cell data did not immediately demarcate into well-separated clusters. The differentiation process was most apparent by looking at the second principal component (PC2), which explained 9.9% of the variability in the dataset. Hence, unlike in the population-averaged data, the differentiation process did not represent the main source of variability at the single-cell level.</p>

<p>Gene expression data were produced by RT-qPCR from individual T2EC collected at six differentiation time-points (0, 8, 24, 33, 48, and 72 h). The expression of 90 genes was analyzed in single-cells by five different multivariate statistical methods: (A) Principal component analysis (PCA), (B) Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), (C) t-SNE, (D) Diffusion map, and (E) kernel PCA. The dots in (A, C, D, and E) and leaves in (B) indicate the single-cells, and the colors indicate the differentiation time-points at which they were collected. t-SNE analysis was performed using the following parameters: initial_dims = 30; perplexity = 60. Diffusion map was run using the following parameters: no_dims = 4, t = 1, and sigma = 1000. Kernel PCA was run with a parameter for computing the “poly” and “gaussian” kernel of 0.1. Only the first two dimensions are plotted.</p>

</fig>
<p>The application of HCA further confirmed that the classification became more complex for single-cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Contrary to bulk analysis, individual cells from the same time-point were not necessarily more similar to each other than to cells from neighboring time-points. Consequently, the clustering of individual cells into groups became complicated. The picture of cell differentiation process that emerged from the single-cell analysis thus far was more complex than the one obtained from the population level analysis. This difference between single-cell and population-level analysis arises from the unraveling of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the single-cell data, which could have been hidden by the averaging effect of the population (see below).</p>
<p>PCA is a linear method for dimensionality reduction of single-cell data. In view of non-linear relationships of cell states in state space, recently nonlinear techniques like t-SNE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref055">55</xref>] or diffusion maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref063">63</xref>] have been applied in single-cell data analysis. t-SNE is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding deemed capable of capturing more local structures than classical PCA, while also revealing global structure such as the presence of clusters at several scales. Diffusion maps use a non-linear distance metric (referred to as diffusion distance), which is deemed conceptually relevant in view of noisy diffusion-like dynamics during differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref063">63</xref>]. We therefore applied these algorithms on our datasets, as well as another non-linear version of PCA, called Kernel PCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref064">64</xref>], not previously applied to single-cell gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g002">Fig 2C to 2E</xref>). The general conclusions obtained by PCA did not appreciably change when using these non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. There was again an obvious trend reflecting the differentiation process, as well as a significant amount of intermingling of cells from different time-points.</p>

<title>Single-Cell Data Embed Population Information and Reveal New Discriminating Genes Involved in the Differentiation Process</title>
<p>In order to assess to what extent the differentiation process was still visible in the single-cell data, we performed PCA on datasets from the two extreme time-points, 0 and 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The result showed a clear separation of both time-points with only a few cells intermingled. We also performed HCA on datasets from the same time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Again, the segregation of the cells was still not perfect, but cells were not as mixed as before. Here, there exist two clusters of self-renewing and differentiating cells. When compared to the analysis of the entire time series, the separation between cells from the two extreme time-points looked clearer. Therefore, the analysis of single-cell data confirmed that part of the information present in the single-cell data is linked to the differentiation process.</p>

<p>The idea that shared information was present in single-cell and population-based data was reinforced by the analysis of the correlation matrices within and between the two datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). It was apparent that (1) the global intensity of the correlations was higher with population-based data and (2) there existed a co-structure between the two datasets. At the population level, we showed that the set of genes selected was relevant to analyze the differentiation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The cross-correlation analysis strengthened this view and demonstrated that when looking at the single-cell scale, the information held by these genes was not totally erased by cell-to-cell variability.</p>
<p>We then looked at the genes that contributed the most to the PCA outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

Among the genes that contributed the most to discriminating differentiated cells, one could highlight <italic>RHPN2</italic> and <italic>betaglobin</italic>.

<title>Single-Cell Data Averaging Recapitulates Results from Population-Level Analysis</title>
<p>Given that the analysis of single-cell gene expression did not produce a clear separation of the temporal stages, in contrast to whole populations, we hypothesized that by averaging over a population of individual cells, we should be able to reproduce the bulk results. For this purpose, we generated three pseudo-populations (sub-populations) of about one-third of cells from the single-cell data and computed their average gene expressions for each time-point. By performing PCA on the mean gene expressions of these pseudo-populations, we noticed that the averaged data showed more organization and, importantly, that the differentiation progression materialized along the PC1 dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>The PCA result of the pseudo-population therefore looked much more like the population than the single-cell results. Similarly, HCA generated a clustering that was not quite as clear as the analysis of bulk RNA data, but much better than the single-cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The HCA results showed for example similarities between gene expressions from time-points 48 and 72 h. Together the pseudo-population analysis obtained by statistical averaging of single-cell data mostly recapitulated, albeit not entirely, the population-based results, suggesting that the clear-cut classification of bulk-cell-based data is due to the (physical) averaging effect in populations, in line with a previous account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref065">65</xref>].</p>

<p>For each time-point, we computed a correlation matrix to evaluate how correlated the expression of any pair of genes was, across all cells at a given time. Since data were log-normally distributed, we employed the Spearman correlation coefficient.

Two genes (the nodes of a graph) that exhibited a significant correlation were connected by an edge. Finally, we sub-sampled 85% of the cells for 10,000 iterations, so as to obtain robust correlation networks that will not depend upon the sampling process. We then constructed a gene correlation network for each time-point. Although both positive and negative correlations were computed, negative correlations proved much less robust and were eliminated by the sub-sampling process, in which we only kept significant correlations that appeared in all of the 10,000 subsampling.</p>

To qualify for a DNB, three conditions have to be fulfilled: (1) the coefficent of variation (CV) of each variable in the DNB should increase, (2) the correlation (PCCin) within the DNB should increase, and (3) the correlation (PCCout) between the DNB and outside genes should decrease. All three conditions can be simultaneously quantified using the I score (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref>).

<p>Although PCCin slightly decreased with time, this group of genes nevertheless might still qualify for a DNB since they matched two out of the three criteria used to identify DNBs. Their I value first sharply increased before returning to lower values. This rise is mostly due to a sharp decrease in PCCout between 0 and 8 h, accompanied by a more modest increase in CV. As mentioned, the internal correlation value PCCin decreased, and therefore was not driving the I value. One must note that we computed a Pearson correlation coefficient as advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref051">51</xref>]. We also tried a Spearman correlation value, which showed a slightly different behavior with a modest increase in PCCin between 8 and 24 h and continued to increase steadily up to 72 h, not affecting the global surge in I value (not shown).</p>

<title>The Initial Driver Genes belong to the Sterol Synthesis Pathway</title>
<p>Since we observed major changes after 8 h of differentiation, one asked how early changes in gene expression could be detected. For this we performed a second single-cell kinetic experiment, where we obtained the expression level of 90 genes in 48, 48, 39, and 41 single cells from 0, 2, 4, and 8 h of differentiation, respectively.</p>
<p>We then defined the first wave of response as genes that showed a significant difference between 0 and 2 h.

<p>The second wave was defined as genes not belonging to wave 1 and showing a significant difference between 2 and 4 h of the response. Five genes satisfied this criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g007">Fig 7</xref>). It was remarkable that six out of the seven genes from waves 1 and 2 belonged to the same functional group, that is the group of genes associated with sterol synthesis. This proved to be highly statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). We therefore can propose that the sterol synthesis pathway could act as one of the drivers of the changes that will update the internal network from the changes in external conditions.

<title>A Surge in Cell-to-Cell Variability</title>
<p>A critical novel opportunity provided by single-cell analysis is to study cell-to-cell variability of gene expression as an observable per se and also to add new insight to characterize the temporal progression of differentiation. The question as to what may be the best metrics for quantifying gene expression variability is still open. An aggregated measure called the Jensen-Shannon divergence has been proposed previously as a measure for gene expression noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref009">9</xref>]. One of the main drawbacks of this metric is that it was not possible to assess whether or not the differences observed were statistically significant. We therefore decided to use a simpler Shannon measure of the heterogeneity among the cells for their gene expression profile (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Such a measure provided a distribution of entropy values per gene per time-point, allowing to perform statistical tests. We observed that this entropy increased gradually along the differentiation process, reaching its maximal value at 8 to 24 h, before declining toward 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>

<p>Such an increase of entropy between 0 and 8h resulted from a global increase of each gene entropy, except for a few (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The observed rise in entropy value was highly significant as early as 8 h when compared to 0 h of differentiation. Furthermore, decrease in entropy also became significant between 24 and 33 h of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Consequently, since entropy can be defined as a measure of the disorder of a system, this result suggested that a maximal heterogeneity was achieved at 8–24 h of the differentiation process in the expression of our 90 genes, before significantly decreasing to a much lower level of heterogeneity.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Potential Explanation for the Rise in Variability</title>
<p>Different potential causes can be envisioned to explain this increase in entropy, including cell size and cell-cycle stage variations, asynchrony in the differentiation process, and more dynamical causes.</p>
<p>As suggested in some previous works, cell size and cell-cycle stage variations could influence gene expression, and become confounding factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref069">69</xref>]. Nevertheless, variability due to variations in cell cycle has been shown to be quantitatively negligible in erythroid precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref070">70</xref>]. We also added in our gene list the CTCF gene, known to be cell-cycle regulated in chicken cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref071">71</xref>]. Almost no correlation was detected between this gene and any of the 91 other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g009">Fig 9A</xref>) demonstrating that our gene list contained virtually no other cell-cyle-regulated gene. Furthermore, we assessed whether or not the repartition of our cells within the different phases of the cell cycle could have been modified at a time where entropy was peaking. No significant difference in cell cycle repartition could be seen at 8 h of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Altogether, those results demonstrate that a potential effect of cell cycle variation would only marginally explain our data. Regarding cell size, it is important to note that in our system the peak in gene expression variability at 8–24 h occurs at a time where cell size is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). If anything, we observed a slight increase in cell size, which could be responsible for a decrease, and not an increase, in noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref072">72</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>We then assessed a potential effect of asynchrony in the differentiation process. For this, we first employed the following algorithms: SCUBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref052">52</xref>], WANDERLUST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref053">53</xref>] and TSCAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref054">54</xref>] to reorder the cells according to the calculated pseudotimes. However, SCUBA led to a cell re-ordering that was highly inconsistent with the actual time-points, where all self-renewing cells (time 0 h) were placed in the middle of the SCUBA order (not shown). WANDERLUST and TSCAN produced a more reasonable cell ordering. However, the trajectories of the gene expression profiles following this ordering were quite erratic (not shown). Nevertheless, the entropy of sub-populations of cells, grouped according to either their WANDERLUST pseudotimes or TSCAN clusters, showed the same rise-then-fall profile as with the original single cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g009">Fig 9C and 9D</xref>).</p>
<p>In theory, these algorithms are supposed to reconstruct a posteriori the “hidden” order along the differentiation pathway. Within this frame, the behavior of entropy in re-ordered cells tends to support the idea that asynchrony in the differentiation process is not the leading cause of our observed increase in entropy.</p>
<p>However the intrinsic burstiness of the gene expression process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref073">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref075">75</xref>] might cause some issues in the use of cell re-ordering algorithms. We therefore examined this question by using a more formal approach. We reasoned that a modeling strategy might be useful in establishing the role asynchrony might play, especially since forcing a synchronous differentiation is not accessible in vitro, but can be done in silico. We used a two-state model of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref056">56</xref>], for which we could learn the parameters from the data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials and Methods</xref>). In the synchronous case, we obtained a variation in entropy resembling the one we calculated from the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). The introduction of asynchrony induced a flatter time profile of the entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g009">Fig 9F</xref>).</p>
<p>This finding did not, however, prove that our cells are synchronously differentiating, but only demonstrated the effect of asynchrony: in the background of bursty gene transcriptional process, asynchrony will tend to smoothen (and not augment) the entropy of the system. Therefore the observed surge in entropy can not be attributed to the asynchrony of the process.</p>
<p>The rise-and-fall of entropy in our data is in line was examined in a different setting, namely a reprogramming process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref058">58</xref>]. The authors stated, “The initial transcriptional response is relatively homogeneous,” offering the opportunity to examine the entropy time profile in such a homogeneous process. Our analysis of this dataset produced a similar behavior for entropy which significantly increased initially, before returning to lower values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether our analysis is compatible with the notion that the rise and fall in entropy is the consequence of the dynamical behavior of the underlying gene regulatory network.</p>

<title>The Point of No Return in T2EC Differentiation is Located between 24 h and 48 h</title>
<p>The above analysis of single-cell transcript profiles displays the following pattern:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>A decrease in correlation value is observed between 0 and 8 h, and then correlation increases between 24 and 72 h.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>An increase in I score value is observed between 0 and 8 h, then a return to its initial value at about 33 h, before continuing to decrease gradually.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A surge in entropy is significant at 8–24 h, and significantly decreases between 24 and 72 h.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Altogether, those results point toward the 8 and 24 h time-points as being a possible decision point, hence, a “point-of-no-return” in the differentiation process, beyond which cells are irreversibly committed toward erythrocytic differentiation. Consequently, we hypothesized that committed cells would be unable to revert back to a self-renewal process after 24 h of differentiation. To test this hypothesis we induced T2EC to differentiate for 24 h or 48 h, after which cells were transferred back into the self-renewal medium, in order to determine whether or not cells could revert back to the undifferentiated state after they had received differentiation signals for a given period of time. We observed that T2EC induced to differentiate for 24 h were still able to self-renew upon change of medium, while cells induced for 48 h could not do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g010">Fig 10A</xref>).</p>
<p>T2EC induced for 48 h seemed to stay in a quiescent state until they died. We therefore concluded that the physiological point of no return is located between 24 h and 48 h of our differentiation process, as suggested by our in silico analysis. Finally we determined whether cell size, a phenotypic integrated variable that has historically been used to monitor erythroid maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref077">77</xref>] would manifest the behavior of the underlying molecular network with respect to cell-cell variability. We therefore assessed cell size variation during the differentiation process. As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref032">32</xref>], mean cell size started to decrease during differentiation to reach a minimum by 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Interestingly, cell size variability significantly peaked at 48 h before dropping precipitously by 72 h. Thus the high variability of gene expression observed at 24 h preceded a significant peak in cell size variability 1 d later.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present work we assessed, using single-cell RT-qPCR, the temporal changes of gene expression in individual cells in a population of cells undergoing differentiation. For this, we used a physiologically relevant cellular system, which presents three main advantages: (i) those cells are primary, non-transformed cells; (ii) they do not show any tendency to spontaneous differentiation; and (iii) they can only differentiate along the erythrocytic lineage, excluding heterogeneity arising from coexistence of cells differentiating along different lineages.</p>
<p>To quantitatively assess the role of gene expression variability, we first defined a subset of genes relevant for analyzing the differentiation process. At the level of whole-population analysis this gene subset allowed a clear distinction among differentiation time-points. However, when assessed at the single-cell level, our analyses revealed a much higher cellular heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, the selected genes were still effective in separating the two most extreme time-points in T2EC differentiation, confirming that information associated with the differentiation process is embodied in the gene expression data at the single-cell level. From the dataset that we generated at the single-cell level, two main results could be obtained: (i) regarding the biology of the erythroid differentiation, we identified previously unidentified genes as being important components of the self-renewal and differentiation of erythroid progenitors, and (ii) on a larger perspective, our results fully supported a dynamical view where differentiation can be seen as a critical phase transition driven by stochasticity.</p>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Identification of new genes involved in the erythroid differentiation process</title>
<p>One question deals with the possible identification of important genes that can be seen as “drivers” of the process. At least three list of genes were generated during the course of this work that may qualify:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>the “early drivers,” genes identified in the wave analysis;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the genes qualifying for the DNB, and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the most densely connected genes in the correlation graph;</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Restricting only to the most densely correlated genes at 0 and 8 h (since the two other lists were validated on those time-points), one observed a partial overlap between the three lists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), with no gene being common to all three lists. One possible explanation is simply that the three lists were obtained through different approaches, not supposed to identify the same set of genes. This result nevertheless suggests that although all of those genes might be functionally important for the differentiation process, they might be involved in the global response at different levels. The early drivers might be more important for informing the whole network at early time points, whereas the two other genes sets might be involved in a more global reconfiguration of the network at later time-points. In any case those gene lists are to be seen as traces resulting from the behavior of the underlying dynamical network, and should not be mistaken for the dynamical network itself. It would therefore be of utmost importance to be able to correctly infer such a network. We are actively pursuing this goal in our group.</p>
<p>We discuss below possible functions of some of those genes, a full discussion for all genes being out of the scope of the present paper.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, <italic>Sca2</italic> is a gene which we have previously shown to be associated with the self-renewal of erythroid progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>LDHA</italic> encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, and has been involved in the Warburg effect (or anaerobic glycolysis), which is the propensity of cancer cells to take up glucose avidly and convert it to lactate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref078">78</xref>]. Furthermore, deletion of <italic>LDHA</italic> has been shown to significantly inhibit the function of both hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during murine hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref079">79</xref>].</p>
<p>Since <italic>LDHA</italic> expression is under the control of HIF1<italic>α</italic> transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref079">79</xref>], it could be involved in the response of immature erythroid progenitors to anemia. Those cells have to show a significant amount of self-renewal for recovering from a strong anemia, implying low oxygen condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref080">80</xref>]. It makes perfect sense that in this case the metabolism of self-renewing progenitors would rely upon an anaerobic pathway.</p>
<p>Moreover, HIF1alpha has also been shown to be an upstream regulator of HSP90<italic>alpha</italic> secretion in cancer cells in a protective way against the hypoxic tumoral environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref081">81</xref>]. Therefore, our results are in line with other findings showing that anaerobic glycolysis is favored in hypoxic conditions, such as the bone marrow environment, and required for stem cell maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref082">82</xref>]. Otherwise, since <italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>HSP90alpha</italic> form part of the lists of potentially important genes between 0 and 8 h, our finding suggests that erythroid differentiation might be accompanied by a change from anaerobic glycolysis toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as recently proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref083">83</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, our analysis highlighted the importance of the sterol synthesis pathway in the self renewal process since:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Among genes identified by RNAseq whose expression changed significantly, we found different genes associated to the sterol synthesis, such as <italic>HMGCS1</italic>, <italic>CYP51A1</italic>, <italic>DHCR24</italic>, <italic>DHCR7</italic>, <italic>STARD4</italic>, and <italic>NSDHL</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s004">S4 Fig</xref>);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The expression of those genes decreased promptly after the change of the external conditions, i.e the induction of the differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g007">Fig 7</xref>);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>STARD4</italic> was both an early driver and one of the genes that displayed the highest number of edges at 0 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002585.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that <italic>STARD4</italic> expression could be used as poor prognosis gene in a six genes signature that defines aggressive subtypes in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref084">84</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These observations support the importance of sterol synthesis in the maintenance of cellular self renewal state and the necessity of a decrease of some sterol associated genes expression to allow the differentiation. The question as to why this group of genes act as the early sensors of change in environmental conditions remains elusive. In line with our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref035">35</xref>], one could hypothesize that cholesterol synthesis is a barrier toward differentiation/apoptosis that has to be lowered for differentiation to proceed.</p>

<sec id="sec016">
<title>A functional role for the surge in gene expression during critical transition?</title>
<p>On a more global perspective, the importance of cell-to-cell heterogeneity as a “biological observable” at the single-cell level, even among cells classified as belonging to the same “cell type” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref085">85</xref>], is increasingly recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref086">86</xref>]. But to what extent and when is such heterogeneity functionally important? Most single-cell transcript profile analyses of cell populations have so far focused mostly on computational descriptive analysis to identify clusters, and temporal progression, or to test dimensionality reduction and visualization tools, but less so to test a biological hypothesis. Here we used the single-cell granularity of gene expression analysis to test the long-standing hypothesis that stochastic cell-cell variability is not simply the byproduct of molecular noise but that such randomness of cell state plays a key role in differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref028">28</xref>]. In this Darwinian view, differentiation starts with an unstable gene expression pattern, generating cell type diversity. Therefore, one testable prediction was that an increase in gene expression heterogeneity should be observed during the critical phase of cell differentiation whenever the irreversible decision to commit is made.</p>
<p>Our main contribution is a demonstration that the increase in molecular variability precedes critical functional variations in cellular parameters, most importantly including the commitment status of the cells. Taken together, the timing of three observables achieved at single-cell resolution provides a coherent picture of a temporal structure of differentiation that would be invisible to traditional whole-population averaging techniques: (i) the surge in cell-to-cell variability of gene expression patterns of individual cells at 8–24 h; (ii) a sudden drop in the overall correlation, concomitant with the emergence of a DNB; and (iii) followed by the phenotypic marker of differentiation, the decrease of cell size, for which variability peaks at 48 h.</p>
<p>An important question is the relevance of that peak in variability. We demonstrated experimentally that no cell was able to return to a self-renewal state after 48 h in a differentiation medium. A similar timing for point-of-no return has previously been suggested in FDPC-mix cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref087">87</xref>]. Such an irreversible commitment to differentiation preceded by a highly significant increase in cell-to-cell variability is consistent with the explanation that cells differentiate by passing through two phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref087">87</xref>]: a first phase in which the self-renewing state is destabilized and primed by perturbation of their extracellular environment, followed by a second phase of a stochastic commitment to differentiation.</p>
<p>These observables (emergence of a DNB, drop in correlation, significant increase in entropy, surge in cellular parameters variations) jointly suggest a critical state transition, a class of dynamical behaviors that has been proposed to explain the qualitative, almost discrete and noise-driven “switching” into a new cell state as embodied by differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref088">88</xref>]. This conceptual framework naturally explains the irreversibility of fate commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref089">89</xref>]. Indeed the maximum of the above three observables coincided with the functionally demonstrated point-of-no return to the self-renewal state in T2EC differentiation process, which was located between 24 and 48 h.</p>
<p>From a more biological perspective, we can view differentiation induction as a process of adaptation in which the cell’s internal molecular network, adapted for growth in self-renewal conditions, has to adjust to the new external conditions when differentiation is induced by the change in external conditions. For example, in yeast, it has been shown that a nonspecific transcriptional response reflecting the natural plasticity of the regulatory network supports adaptation of cells to novel challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref090">90</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms are yet to be discovered, but one would expect global mechanisms to be involved. Modifications of the chromatin dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref027">27</xref>] under the possible control of metabolic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref091">91</xref>] are obvious candidates for such a role. Fluctuation in important transcription factor level has also been proposed to be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref092">92</xref>]. The surge of non-specific variability would allow exploration of new regions in the gene expression space. Preventing such an increase in variability has been associated to trapping cells in an undifferentiated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref093">93</xref>]. This increase would lead to a reconfiguration of the gene expression network into a state which is compatible with differentiation conditions and which is robust and consistent with a new attractor state in the network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref029">29</xref>]. Then the decrease of molecular variability might reflect the implementation of the fully differentiated phenotype as cells settle down in the next stable state.</p>
<p>In this study, we exploited the wealth of information available in single-cell data by highlighting the critical molecular changes occurring along the differentiation sequence. First, the initial gene expression waves might represent a very early signal that happens between 0 and 8 h, followed by a pre-transition warning signal revealed by the DNB analysis, concomitant with the drop in gene correlations and the rise in cell-to-cell variability. Such a pattern are thought to reflect the underlying dynamical molecular mechanisms that drives the evolution of cells through the differentiation process. The first signals could be seen as an adaptative response to environmental changes, as suggested above, whereas the last warning signal, before irreversible commitment, could be seen as the point of cell decision making. At that stage it is hard to really be sure that the DNB genes actually drives the critical transition, but at the very least they represent a clear signal that our cells are experiencing such a transition. Until 24 h, at least, cells would still be able to functionally respond to self-renewal signals. This implies that at that stage the state of the network would be compatible with both a differentiation and a self-renewal process. One of the remaining challenging questions is what makes the cell takes the irreversible decision to differentiate at a point when the system seems to be totally disorganized. We strongly believe that this will be an emerging properties from the behavior of dynamical high-dimensional molecular network.</p>
<p>While the current study offers a single-cell resolution view on gene expression, it does so only through snapshots at strategically selected time-points. In the future it would therefore be of great importance to obtain a continuous measurement of the underlying gene expression network in order to explain the state changes in individual cells and to reconstruct the entire trajectory of each cell in gene expression state space. This information would expose the actual process of diversification that leads to the maximal heterogeneity marking the point of no return of differentiation.</p>

<title>RT-qPCR: low-level data analysis</title>
<p>First, a manual examination was performed regarding data quality. RTqPCR data were exported from the BioMark HD data collection software. On every microfluidic-based chip, each gene was controlled in a qualitative manner in order to keep only reliable and good quality data. For this we manually edited the data files by adding a new column named “DELETED.” Numbers “0” or “1” were appended in this column according to various criteria. Quality control was based both upon amplification and melting curves examination. For one given gene all the melting curves had to be centered on a unique melting temperature. When a given melting curve peak shifted to a higher or lower Tm, “1” was added into the DELETED column for this amplification. Moreover, data displaying a double peak were also considered unreliable and annotated with a “1.” Finally, “noisy” amplification curves departing from the smooth classical sigmoidal shape were also tagged as “1.” We allowed the quantification cycle (Cq) to be as high as 30. For a higher number of cycles, the machine returned a value of 999, meaning that there were not enough molecules to be detected. After this quality control, Cq values of data tagged as “1” were replaced with UD (for “undefined”) in the raw data file, since they would not be taken into account in later analysis. Then the new table underwent an automatic formatting consisting in a second multiple-criteria cleaning process using an in-house R script. Cq values were converted into (approximately) absolute numbers of molecules according to the following steps. First, we selected cells with at least one valid spike measurement (i.e., whose Cq is different from UD and 999). Then, we normalized the raw value <inline-formula id="pbio.1002585.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.1002585.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002585.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>Cq</mml:mtext> <mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> for cell <italic>i</italic> and RNA <italic>j</italic> according to the cell mean spike value <inline-formula id="pbio.1002585.e002"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.1002585.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002585.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M2"><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mtext>Cq</mml:mtext> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> (or the only available spike if one is invalid), with the global mean spike value <inline-formula id="pbio.1002585.e003"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.1002585.e003g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002585.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M3"><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mtext>Cq</mml:mtext> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> as reference.

<title>Technical Reproducibility</title>
<p>Since RT-qPCR experimental procedure introduces unavoidable technical noise, we decided to explore which steps were the main sources of this variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We first assessed the reproducibility of the cDNA pre-amplification step by amplifying four cDNA samples from the same RT before analyzing it by qPCR. Gene expression levels differences between pre-amplification replicates were found to be negligible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). We then checked the RT-qPCR amplification step by analyzing the <italic>RPL22L1</italic> gene three times per chip. Expression levels between <italic>RPL22L1</italic> triplicates were quantitatively extremely similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s001">S1C to S1E Fig</xref>), confirming that amplification brings a negligible amount of variability as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref043">43</xref>].

We observed significant gene expression level differences between three RT from the same sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s001">S1A and S1F Fig</xref>), contrary to replicates from other critical steps. Indeed, it has been demonstrated and discussed that the RT reaction is the main source of technical noise, since it introduces biases through priming efficiency, RNA integrity and secondary structures and reverse transcriptase dynamic range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref045">45</xref>]. In order to estimate the amount of variation introduced in our experiments by this step, we used external RNA spikes. The variation affecting those spikes spanned 5.8 Cqs (mean of Cq<sub>max</sub>−Cq<sub>min</sub> across the spikes) whereas the variability affecting the genes spanned a much larger region of 22.9 Cqs (mean of Cq<sub>max</sub>−Cq<sub>min</sub> across the genes), showing that the biological variability was much larger than the variability introduced by the RT step.</p>

<title>Re-ordering algorithms</title>
<p>We performed the pseudotemporal ordering of cells using three different algorithms: SCUBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref052">52</xref>], WANDERLUST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref053">53</xref>] and TSCAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref054">54</xref>]. SCUBA is a two-step cell-ordering algorithm, in which one first reduces the data dimensionality by using t-SNE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref055">55</xref>] and then determines the principal curve in the low-dimensional projection. We applied SCUBA by reducing the data into 2-D using tSNE (perplexity = 30) and by adopting k-segments algorithm (maximal number of segments = 8) as the option for the principal curve analysis. Since the differentiation path estimated by SCUBA was undirected, we set <italic>LDHA</italic> as the anchor-gene/marker to define the beginning and the end of pseudotime.</p>
<p>In contrast, WANDERLUST is a non-branching trajectory detection algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref053">53</xref>]. The method estimates the pseudotimes by representing each single-cell as a node in an ensemble of k-nearest-neighbor graph, followed by assigning a trajectory for each graph. This trajectory is defined by connecting cells with similar gene expressions through the shortest path. To reinforce this path assembly, a set of cells is randomly chosen as waypoints. The final cell ordering corresponds to the average trajectories over the ensemble of graphs. Here, we adopted the cosine similarity distance function for the trajectory detection, in which the single cell with the maximum <italic>LDHA</italic> expression was used as the initial node. Each cell’s pseudotime has a value normalized between 0 and 1, reflecting its position along the differentiation path. For the entropy calculation, we grouped the cells into five pseudo-clusters, by collecting cells within five evenly spaced pseudotime window between 0 and 1 (e.g., pseudo-cluster 1 contained cells with pseudotime between 0 and 0.2, pseudo-cluster 2 contained cells with pseudotime between 0.2 and 0.4, and so on).</p>
<p>Finally, TSCAN is a cluster-based minimum spanning tree ordering algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref054">54</xref>]. The algorithm begins with clustering cells according to the similarity in their gene expressions, and continues with building the minimum spanning tree (MST) connecting the centroids of these clusters. The pseudotime is calculated by projecting each single cell to the MST edges. The algorithm also implements a preprocessing step involving gene clustering and dimensional reduction in order to alleviate the effect of drop-out events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref054">54</xref>]. The preprocessing of our data produced 36 gene clusters, on which we employed the independent component analysis (ICA) to obtain a 2-D projection. Finally, we applied TSCAN using five cell clusters to generate the cell pseudotimes.</p>
<p>We computed the entropy for each cluster of cells following the procedure described above.</p>

<title>In silico simulations of the differentiation process</title>
<p>In order to stabilize the model before differentiation start, we ran the simulation for 100 h (model time) with constant parameters (value corresponding to 0 h). In silico differentiation was induced by a change in parameters values to now impose the parameters deduced from the in vitro data at different time-points. At each time step we computed parameters value with a linear interpolation between the two nearest time-points. For example at simulation time 4 h parameters values correspond to the mean value between 0 and 8 h. We simulated 100 cells at each time-point. In order to study the impact of asynchronous differentiation, we compared two situations:</p>

<p>All cells had their parameters changed simultaneously, corresponding to a synchronous differentiation.</p>

<title>Representation of the 92 selected genes.</title>
<p>(A) On the basis of RNA-Seq data and k-means analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), the 92 genes selected for the single-cell analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002585.s010">S1 Table</xref>) can be separated into three types: up-regulated (red circles), invariant (green circles), and down-regulated genes (blue circles) at 48 h of the differentiation process. For each gene (<italic>x</italic>-axis) the fold-change (FC) between the self-renewal state and the differentiation state at 48 h (Diff/SR) was plotted along the <italic>y</italic>-axis. (B) Representation of known connections among the 92 genes selected according to the STRING database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://string.embl.de/" xlink:type="simple">http://string.embl.de/</ext-link>). Each edge between two genes corresponds to a known association between those genes. The densely connected component at the center of the network graph is composed of genes involved in sterol biosynthesis. A cluster of gene encoding porteins involved in signal transduction is apparent on the top right part of the network.</p>

<title>Cross-correlation analysis between the gene expression value in populations and in single cells.</title>
<p>The correlation matrix is divided into four smaller matrices: the correlation matrix of each dataset (populations: top-left panel; single-cells: bottom-right panel) and the correlation matrix between the two datasets (top-right and bottom-left panels, showing the same values). The values of the correlations are color-coded according to the scale given below. Correlation are calculated for each gene either accross populations samples or across single cells.</p>

<title>Variation of entropy during a reprogramming process.</title>
<p>We computed differential gene expression between 0 and 2 d using the scRNA-seq data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002585.ref058">58</xref>]. We then computed an entropy value per time-point for the 776 resulting genes. Statistical significance was computed using a Wilcoxon test.</p>

<title>Overlapping genes between DNBs, early drivers and correlation network nodes at 0–8 h of differentiation.</title>
<p>The Venn diagram shows the overlap of the three lists of genes obtained from the initial expression waves analysis (green), the correlation networks (pink), and the DNB theory (blue). The common genes between these lists were searched at 0 and 8 h when all three analyses have been performed (early driver genes were only identified between 0 and 8 h).</p>
