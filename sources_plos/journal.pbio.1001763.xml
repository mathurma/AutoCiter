<p>This study identifies a GPCR, S1PR2, as a receptor for the Nogo-A-Δ20 domain of the membrane protein Nogo-A, which inhibits neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Nogo-A is a membrane protein of the central nervous system (CNS) restricting neurite growth and synaptic plasticity via two extracellular domains: Nogo-66 and Nogo-A-Δ20. Receptors transducing Nogo-A-Δ20 signaling remained elusive so far. Here we identify the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) as a Nogo-A-Δ20-specific receptor. Nogo-A-Δ20 binds S1PR2 on sites distinct from the pocket of the sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and signals via the G protein G<sub>13</sub>, the Rho GEF LARG, and RhoA. Deleting or blocking S1PR2 counteracts Nogo-A-Δ20- and myelin-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth and cell spreading. Blockade of S1PR2 strongly enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of wild-type but not Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup> mice, indicating a repressor function of the Nogo-A/S1PR2 axis in synaptic plasticity. A similar increase in LTP was also observed in the motor cortex after S1PR2 blockade. We propose a novel signaling model in which a GPCR functions as a receptor for two structurally unrelated ligands, a membrane protein and a sphingolipid. Elucidating Nogo-A/S1PR2 signaling platforms will provide new insights into regulation of synaptic plasticity.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated an important role of Nogo-A signaling in the repression of structural and synaptic plasticity in mature neuronal networks of the central nervous system. These insights extended our understanding of Nogo-A's inhibitory function far beyond its well-studied role as axonal-growth inhibitor. Repression is mediated via two different Nogo-A extracellular domains: Nogo-66 and Nogo-A-Δ20. Here, we identify the G-protein coupled receptor S1PR2 as a high-affinity receptor for Nogo-A-Δ20 and demonstrate that S1PR2 binds this domain with sites different from the recently proposed S1P binding pocket. Interfering with S1PR2 activity, either pharmacologically or genetically, prevented Nogo-A-Δ20-mediated inhibitory effects. Similar results were obtained when we blocked G<sub>13</sub>, LARG, and RhoA, components of the downstream signaling pathway. These findings revealed a strong increase in hippocampal and cortical synaptic plasticity when acutely interfering with Nogo-A/S1PR2 signaling, similar to previous results obtained by blocking Nogo-A. We thus provide a novel biological concept of multi-ligand GPCR signaling in which this sphingolipid-activated GPCR is also bound and activated by the high molecular weight membrane protein Nogo-A.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Factors inhibiting nerve fiber growth substantially contribute to the limited regenerative capacity of the adult central nervous system (CNS) after injury. They play important roles in stabilizing the complex wiring of the adult CNS of higher vertebrates and in establishing neuronal pathways in the developing nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Akbik1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Schwab1">[2]</xref>. One of the best-studied factors is the membrane protein Nogo-A, which occurs in myelin and certain neurons, inhibiting axonal regeneration and plasticity after CNS injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Filbin1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Yiu1">[5]</xref>. Neutralization of Nogo-A has been shown to enhance axonal growth and compensatory sprouting in the adult spinal cord and brain, as well as to improve functional recovery after CNS injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Schwab2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Kempf1">[6]</xref>. Recent studies have shown novel important roles of Nogo-A signaling in the repression of synaptic plasticity in mature neuronal networks, indicating an inhibitory potential of Nogo-A far beyond its well-studied restriction of axonal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Akbik1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Delekate1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Tews1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Nogo-A exerts its inhibitory effects via two distinct extracellular domains: Nogo-66 (rat amino acid (aa) 1026–1091) and Nogo-A-Δ20 (rat aa544–725; part of “Amino-Nogo”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Schwab1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Oertle1">[12]</xref>. Nogo-66 induces growth inhibition via two membrane proteins, Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Fournier1">[13]</xref>, together with accessory proteins, and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Atwal1">[14]</xref>. By contrast, the molecular identification and characterization of the receptor(s) transducing signals from the inhibitory Nogo-A-Δ20 domain has failed so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Schwab1">[2]</xref>. Nogo-A-Δ20 has been shown to partially mediate its inhibitory activity by interfering with integrins, but proof of a direct interaction has remained elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hu1">[15]</xref>. Here we identified the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) as a functional receptor for the Δ20 domain of Nogo-A.</p>
<p>S1PR2 belongs to the subfamily of five S1PRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Spiegel1">[16]</xref>. S1PRs are known to be activated by the low molecular weight (MW) lipid ligand sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which exerts diverse receptor-specific effects on various cell types, including regulation of apoptosis, cell motility and cytoskeleton dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Spiegel1">[16]</xref>. In the brain and spinal cord, S1P has been shown to regulate angiogenesis and neurite outgrowth: activation of S1PR1 promotes neurite outgrowth <italic>in vitro</italic> via G<sub>i/o</sub> and Rac1, whereas activation of S1PR2 leads to neurite retraction, involving G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>q</sub>, or G<sub>12/13</sub> and the RhoA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Spiegel1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Toman1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we demonstrate that Nogo-A-Δ20 binds S1PR2 <italic>via</italic> extracellular receptor loops 2 and 3, which are distinct from the previously described binding site of S1P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hanson1">[19]</xref>. Nogo-A-Δ20 signals through the G protein G<sub>13</sub>, leukemia-associated Rho guanine exchange factor (RhoGEF) LARG and RhoA. Deleting or blocking S1PR2 counteracts Nogo-A-Δ20- and myelin-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth and cell spreading. Acute S1PR2 blockade increases hippocampal and cortical long-term synaptic plasticity similarly to Nogo-A neutralization. These results strengthen the recently proposed physiological role of Nogo-A in restricting synaptic plasticity to stabilize neuronal circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Akbik1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Mironova1">[9]</xref>. Further, these data support the paradigm shift for GPCR signaling from the classical “one ligand – one receptor” situation towards more dynamic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-BenShlomo1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Kenakin1">[21]</xref>.</p>

<title>Nogo-A Binds to S1PR2</title>
<p>The GPCR S1PR2 was identified as a novel receptor candidate of the Nogo-A-Δ20 domain using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen of custom-made adult and fetal human brain libraries. In the adult CNS, S1PR2 is mainly expressed in the grey matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Hippocampal pyramidal cells, cerebellar Purkinje cells, cortical neurons and spinal motoneurons, as well as retinal ganglion cells are S1PR2-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g001">Figure 1A–1K</xref>). Importantly, S1PR2 is also expressed in Nogo-A-Δ20-responsive cells <italic>in vitro</italic> including 3T3 fibroblasts and immature cerebellar granule neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001763.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To validate the interaction of Nogo-A-Δ20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and S1PR2, His-tagged Nogo-A-Δ20 was co-incubated with membranes of S1PR2-overexpressing cells and subsequently immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). S1PR2 was specifically detected in immunoprecipitation fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Vice versa, His-tagged Nogo-A-Δ20 could be specifically probed in S1PR2 immunoprecipitated fractions, suggesting that the two proteins interact <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments of Nogo-A or S1PR2 from whole mouse brain protein extracts further demonstrated that endogenous S1PR2 interacts with Nogo-A under physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine the binding affinity, binding of the entire Δ20-containing extracellular N-terminal domain of Nogo-A (Nogo-A-ext; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) to biosensor-immobilized membrane preparations expressing functional full length S1PR2 protein or non S1PR2-expressing control membranes was monitored in real-time using Bio-Layer interferometry (OctetRED). Non-linear fitting revealed that Nogo-A-ext binds to S1PR2 with an apparent equilibrium binding constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of ∼142 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The binding affinity was not influenced by the addition of S1P versus vehicle control (MeOH) (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> <sub>MeOH</sub>∼192 nM; <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> <sub>S1P</sub>∼202 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). For a mapping of binding sites, individual extracellular domains (N-terminus and extracellular loops [ECLs]) of S1PR2 were synthesized as peptides and analyzed for binding to Nogo-A-Δ20 by microscale thermophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Nogo-A-Δ20 was found to bind primarily to ECL2 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>∼280 nM) and 3 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>∼350 nM), less strongly to ECL1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>∼2 µM) and negligibly to the N-terminus of S1PR2 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>∼11 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, binding analysis of the other bioactive domain of Nogo-A, Nogo-66, to S1PR2 extracellular domains revealed only unspecific binding in the high micromolar range (<italic>K</italic><sub>D ECL1</sub>∼46 µM; <italic>K</italic><sub>D ECL2</sub>∼7 µM; <italic>K</italic><sub>D ECL3</sub>∼67 µM) or complete absence of binding (N-terminus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Collectively, these data show that Nogo-A-Δ20 but not Nogo-66 binds to specific extracellular domains of the GPCR S1PR2.</p>

To investigate whether S1PR2 is co-internalized upon Nogo-A-Δ20 treatment, cell surface S1PR2 expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence using a custom-made antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g003">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001763.s002">S2B</xref>, and S2C). Cell surface S1PR2 levels were reduced by ∼64% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) 30 min after addition of Nogo-A-Δ20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To confirm this, plasma membranes of 3T3 cells were prepared 15 and 30 min post-incubation with Nogo-A-Δ20 and analyzed for S1PR2 levels by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001763.s002">S2A</xref>). We found that cell surface S1PR2 levels were reduced by ∼77% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.01) and ∼70% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) after 15 and 30 min incubation with Nogo-A-Δ20, respectively, indicating that S1PR2 is internalized upon binding to Nogo-A-Δ20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the majority of internalized Nogo-A-Δ20 puncta colocalize with S1PR2 as well as with the endosomal marker EEA1 at 15 and 30 min post-incubation with Nogo-A-Δ20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Ubiquitination of GPCRs is a critical post-translational modification, which is often dispensable for initial receptor endocytosis but important for endosomal trafficking to proteasome/lysosomal degradation pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hanyaloglu1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Verzijl1">[24]</xref>.

S1PR2-ubiquitin conjugates were not detected upon internalization of Nogo-A-Δ20 as opposed to S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that Nogo-A-Δ20 signaling is not permanently terminated in the lysosomal degradation pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hanyaloglu1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Oo1">[25]</xref>.

<p>To investigate the functional importance of S1PR2 in Nogo-A-Δ20-mediated neurite outgrowth inhibition, we focused on postnatal day (P) 5–8 cerebellar granule neurons that express S1PR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001763.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Pharmacological blockade of S1PR2 using JTE-013 led to a ∼39% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.01) and ∼44% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05) increase in outgrowth on a Nogo-A-Δ20 and myelin substrate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g004">Figure 4G and 4H</xref>).

<title>Nogo-A-Δ20-Mediated Inhibition Is Modulated by Exogenous S1P</title>
<p>To determine possible functional interactions of Nogo-A-Δ20 and S1P at the level of S1PR2, we first investigated whether Nogo-A-Δ20 itself modulates S1P production. Extra- (EC) and intracellular (IC) S1P levels were quantified in 3T3 and cerebellar granule neuron cultures after a 30 and 60 min stimulation with Nogo-A-Δ20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g005">Figure 5G and 5H</xref>).

<p>We then addressed the role of endogenous S1P in Nogo-A-Δ20-mediated inhibitory effects. Pharmacological blockade of the S1P-producing enzymes sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1 and 2 using D,L-<italic>threo</italic>-dihydrosphingosine (DHS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Dragusin1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Liu1">[35]</xref> had no effect on Nogo-A-Δ20-mediated inhibition of cell spreading, suggesting that SphKs are not downstream elements of Nogo-A-Δ20-induced inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). To confirm this result, MEFs isolated from SphK1<sup>−/−</sup> or SphK2<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Olivera1">[36]</xref> were plated on a Nogo-A-Δ20 substrate. Similarly to SphK blockade, no differences in cell spreading inhibition were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g005">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>
<p>Because S1P is found in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Miller1">[37]</xref> used in our experimental conditions, we investigated if serum-derived S1P modulates Nogo-A-Δ20-mediated inhibition. For this purpose, extracellular S1P was scavenged using the monoclonal anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Ponnusamy1">[38]</xref>. Cell spreading analysis revealed that Nogo-A-Δ20-induced inhibition was alleviated by ∼28% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05) in the presence of the anti-S1P antibody when compared to the anti-BrdU control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g005">Figure 5J</xref>). To exclude that disinhibition of Nogo-A-Δ20 signaling by blocking or silencing S1PR2 is mediated by an increased activation of Rac1-coupled S1PR1 through serum-derived S1P, anti-S1P was applied together with JTE-013. No differences could be observed between anti-S1P- and anti-BrdU-treated cells in the presence of JTE-013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g005">Figure 5J</xref>). Together, these results suggest that S1PR2-mediated inhibition by Nogo-A-Δ20 occurs independently of S1P but that S1P can modulate Nogo-A-Δ20-mediated effects. Indeed, addition of S1P to cells resulted in an ∼31% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) and ∼28% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) decrease in cell spreading inhibition on a control and Nogo-A-Δ20 substrate, respectively, when compared to the MeOH + DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g005">Figure 5K</xref>). These results point to a modulatory function of S1P in Nogo-A-Δ20-mediated inhibition of cell spreading, presumably by independently activating RhoA-coupled cell surface S1PRs, e.g., S1PR2. Concordantly, S1P has been previously described to modulate cell adhesion and growth of different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Toman1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Strochlic1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Lebman1">[39]</xref>.

<title>Blockade of S1PR2 phenocopies the increase in hippocampal and cortical LTP observed upon Nogo-A neutralization.</title>
<p>(A,B) Hippocampal WT (A) and Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup> (B) slices were treated with JTE-013 or vehicle (DMSO) (WT<sub>DMSO</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 8; Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup><sub>DMSO</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 10; WT<sub>JTE-013</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 11; Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup><sub>JTE-013</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 9). 60 min after theta-burst stimulation (arrow), a significant difference in LTP could be observed between JTE-013 and DMSO treatment in WT (A) but not Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup> (B) slices. (C,D) Input-output strength revealed no differences in JTE-013- versus DMSO-treated slices of WT (C) and Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup> (D) mice (WT<sub>DMSO</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 6; Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup><sub>DMSO</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 6; WT<sub>JTE-013</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 7; Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup><sub>JTE-013</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 6). (E,F) PPF revealed no alterations in JTE-013- versus DMSO-treated slices of WT (E) and Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup> (F) mice (WT<sub>DMSO</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 7; Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup><sub>DMSO</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 6; WT<sub>JTE-013</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 5; Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup><sub>JTE-013</sub>: <italic>n</italic> = 6). (G) LTP was measured upon simultaneous neutralization of S1PR2 using JTE-013 and of Nogo-A using 11c7 (IgG1 + DMSO: <italic>n</italic> = 7; IgG1 + JTE-013: <italic>n</italic> = 6; 11c7 + DMSO: <italic>n</italic> = 8; 11c7 + JTE-013: <italic>n</italic> = 6). (H) LTP was measured upon simultaneous neutralization of S1PR2 using JTE-013 and of NgR1 using anti-NgR1 (DMSO: <italic>n</italic> = 7; JTE-013: <italic>n</italic> = 9; anti-NgR1 + JTE-013: <italic>n</italic> = 8). (I) Rat motor forelimb area brain slices were treated with JTE-013 (<italic>n</italic> = 7) or DMSO (<italic>n</italic> = 8).

<p>Next, the outcome of a combined neutralization of the ligand Nogo-A by the function-blocking anti-Nogo-A antibody 11c7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Oertle1">[12]</xref> and of the receptor S1PR2 by JTE-013 was analyzed. A synergistic effect of the combined treatment as compared to either treatment alone would indicate that additional molecules, e.g., S1P are involved in S1PR2-mediated LTP restriction. A similar increase in LTP for all treated groups when compared to the IgG1 + DMSO control with no difference between the groups was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). To assess the relative contribution of the Nogo-A receptors NgR1 and S1PR2 onto Nogo-A-mediated restriction of synaptic plasticity, we simultaneously blocked both receptors. No significant difference could be observed between application of JTE-013 alone versus the combined application of JTE-013 and of the function-blocking anti-NgR1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g006">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated the effect of S1PR2 blockade on long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus. In line with the results obtained after acute Nogo-A neutralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Delekate1">[7]</xref>, JTE-013 application did neither modulate LTD induction nor maintenance compared with control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001763.s006">Figure S6G</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent data indicate that Nogo-A also restricts synaptic plasticity in the primary motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Tews1">[11]</xref>. LTP saturation in this region was also significantly increased in JTE-013 versus DMSO-treated slices (∼39%; <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). No differences in the I/O curves were observed after S1PR2 blockade, indicating that the JTE-013-mediated increase in synaptic plasticity was not due to alterations in baseline synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001763-g006">Figure 6J</xref>). Together, these results show that Nogo-A represses synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and motor cortex via S1PR2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two distinct domains of Nogo-A can induce growth inhibition: Nogo-A-Δ20 and Nogo-66. Here, we identified the GPCR S1PR2 as the first functional receptor for the inhibitory Δ20 domain of Nogo-A. S1PR2 fulfills essential key criteria to be a Nogo-A-Δ20-specific receptor: (i) Expression in the CNS as well as in non-neuronal Nogo-A-Δ20-responsive cells; (ii) high-affinity binding to Nogo-A-Δ20; (iii) prerequisite for Nogo-A-Δ20-induced inhibition of cell spreading and neurite outgrowth; (iv) Nogo-A-Δ20-induced activation of RhoA; (v) restriction of hippocampal and cortical synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title>S1PR2 Is a Receptor for a Lipid and a Protein Ligand</title>
<p>Until very recently, GPCRs were generally thought to be activated by physical and low MW chemical stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Liebscher1">[40]</xref>. However, a few adhesion GPCRs were found to also bind to membrane-bound and matrix ligands via an extended N-terminal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Yona1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Paavola1">[42]</xref>. Many of these receptors such as EGF-containing CD97, the first GPCR shown to bind to the cellular ligand decay accelerating factor, are predominantly expressed by immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hamann1">[43]</xref>. To our knowledge, Nogo-A is the first mammalian membrane protein shown to bind to and signal through a non-orphan GPCR of the rhodopsin-like family. In contrast to adhesion GPCRs, S1PR2 does not bind Nogo-A-Δ20 via its N-terminal domain.</p>
<p>The recent characterization of the crystal structure of S1PR1 provided substantial structural information on its activation by S1P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hanson1">[19]</xref>. Access of the ligand to the binding pocket from the extracellular space is occluded by the N-terminus and the ECLs, and may be gained from within the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hanson1">[19]</xref>. Our data provide strong evidence that Nogo-A-Δ20 primarily interacts with ECL2 and ECL3 of S1PR2, suggesting a different mechanism of activation compared to S1P. Our results also suggest that S1PR2-mediated inhibition by Nogo-A-Δ20 does not require S1P but can be exogenously modulated by the latter. Although binding of Nogo-A-Δ20 to S1PR2 does not require S1P, modulation of receptor-specific physiological outputs by binding of the bioactive lipid to its pocket within the membrane may further expand the signaling repertoire of S1PR2. It may also enable fine-tuned cellular responses depending on the ratio of ligands present under given conditions, as recently suggested for the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Sparvero1">[44]</xref>. Future biochemical and structural studies will be necessary to address this and show how binding is transferred into ligand-specific G-protein-dependent signaling. Detailed investigations will also need to determine whether the presence of additional receptors, i.e. NgR1, affects the binding properties of Nogo-A-Δ20 to S1PR2 as described for other multi-receptor systems, e.g., the viral surface glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 and the GPCR co-receptor CCR5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Lee2">[45]</xref>. We could show that Nogo-A interacts with S1PR2 <italic>in trans</italic>. However, interaction at the surface of the same cell <italic>in cis</italic> might also be possible, similar to what has been proposed for the Nogo-A–NgR1 interaction in Purkinje cells recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Petrinovic1">[46]</xref>. Yet, such mechanisms have not been proven and their existence needs to be investigated in detail.</p>

<title>Multi-ligand/Multi-receptor Cross-Talk</title>
<p>The classic “one ligand–one receptor” paradigm has recently been challenged by an increasing number of multi-ligand/multi-receptor interactions, which could be identified in different biological systems, adding another level of complexity for fine-tuning of cellular responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-BenShlomo1">[20]</xref>. Examples include neurotrophin receptors, Wnt receptors, and receptors for axonal guidance molecules such as plexins and neuropilins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-BenShlomo1">[20]</xref>. We propose that the Δ20 domain of Nogo-A binds to S1PR2 and the Nogo-66 loop to NgR1 and/or PirB, resulting in the formation of a multi-site/multi-ligand receptor complex. NgR1 and PirB can also interact with ligands other than Nogo-A, thereby increasing the dynamics of signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Kempf1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Mironova1">[9]</xref>. Additional Nogo-A co-receptors and downstream signaling components potentially located within or attached to these multi-receptor complexes might further amplify Nogo-A-mediated inhibitory effects. It was recently demonstrated that canonical GPCR signaling also occurs from endosomes for, e.g., the Wnt receptor Frizzled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Niehrs1">[47]</xref> and the β2-adrenoceptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Irannejad1">[48]</xref>. Along this line, the Nogo-A-Δ20/S1PR2 complex is co-internalized into endosomes, from which signaling may be sustained. Currently, the concerted action and downstream trafficking of all these receptor components is still poorly understood, in particular <italic>in vivo</italic>. Future studies will need to assess whether all Nogo-A (co-)receptors are found within the same complex or in different membrane microdomains, and how the receptor composition varies between different cell types, developmental stages, and pathophysiological conditions.</p>

<title>Interfering with Nogo-A/S1PR2 Signaling Increases Synaptic Plasticity</title>
<p>Nogo-A stabilizes neuronal networks by restricting CNS plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Schwab1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Mironova1">[9]</xref>. Acute neutralization of Nogo-A or NgR1 in hippocampal slices was shown to induce an increase in LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Delekate1">[7]</xref>. On the other hand, conventional knockouts of Nogo-A, PirB, or NgR1 do not show significant modulations in LTP, presumably due to compensatory mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Delekate1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Lee1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Raiker1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Tews1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Karlen1">[49]</xref>. This is well in line with the lack of LTP modulation observed in S1PR2<sup>−/−</sup> mice. A novel transgenic rat model in which Nogo-A expression was silenced but not completely ablated by using a synthetic anti-Nogo-A microRNA leaving the genomic locus intact showed a significant increase in LTP in the hippocampus as well as in the motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Tews1">[11]</xref>. This underlines the strong drive for genetic compensation after complete ablation of components within this functionally very important system. Our present findings revealed an increase in hippocampal and cortical LTP when acutely interfering with S1PR2 signaling by JTE-013. Notably, no JTE-013-mediated increase in hippocampal LTP was observed in Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup> mice, underlining the plasticity-restricting role of Nogo-A/S1PR2 signaling independently of S1P. Indeed, CA3–CA1 LTP was shown to be independent of SphK/S1P receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Kanno1">[50]</xref>. Interestingly, the blockade of both Nogo-A receptors NgR1 and S1PR2 does not show an additive effect on LTP potentiation, suggesting that both receptor-evoked responses induced by different domains of Nogo-A converge onto the same signaling pathways. However, detailed mechanisms and kinetics by which Nogo-A/S1PR2-NgR1 modify synaptic plasticity remain to be analyzed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our finding that the GPCR S1PR2 binds two structurally unrelated molecules, a low MW sphingolipid and the high MW membrane protein Nogo-A, by distinct sites contributes to and extends the paradigm shift from a classical linear model of GPCR signaling towards a more dynamic model with shared components and intramolecular cross talks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Ghanouni1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Huber1">[52]</xref>. It will be important to understand to which extent S1P affects signaling induced by Nogo-A and vice-versa. Detailed high-resolution structural characterization of the receptor in complex with S1P, Nogo-A, or both will be required to unravel the mechanistic properties of these two signaling systems. Furthermore, the cell-specific interplay of S1PR2 with known receptors and co-receptors for Nogo-A needs to be determined in detail with regard to their corresponding physiological effects. This information will be the basis for the design of novel molecular tools to better understand the roles of Nogo-A/S1PR2 signaling for CNS plasticity and repair.</p>

<title>Yeast Two-Hybrid Screen</title>
<p>The Nogo-A-Δ20 recombinant protein fused to the activation domain of the GAL4 transcription factor was used as bait to screen for interacting proteins from cDNAs from adult and fetal brain libraries (Clontech) using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Albers1">[53]</xref>. Briefly, the cDNA encoding bait fragment was generated by PCR, cloned into pDONR201, and transferred into GATEWAY (Invitrogen)-compatible versions of pGBT9 by the LR reaction. Yeast strain CG1945 (Clontech) was transformed with the resulting vector. cDNA libraries were transformed into Y187 strain (Clontech). Bait- and prey-expressing yeasts were mated in YPDA in the presence of 10% polyethylene glycol 6000. Medium was changed to selective medium (synthetic dextrose) lacking Leu, Trp, and His with the following additives: 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (50 µg/ml, Invitrogen), 50 µm 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-galactoside (Sigma), and varying concentrations of 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT, Sigma). Different concentrations of 3-AT were tested in pre-screens, varying from 0–60 mM. 60 mM 3-AT produced &lt;20% hits; 130 mM 3-AT was used in the main screen, resulting in ∼0.5% strong bait-prey interactions. Mating efficiency was determined by plating of cells on selective agar plates. The cell suspension was aliquoted into microtiter plates (96 wells/plate, flat bottom, 200 µl/well) and incubated for 3–7 days. Positive clones were screened by determining fluorescence on a SpectraFluor fluorometer (Tecan) at 465 nm (excitation at 360 nm). Wells that displayed fluorescence above background were identified and automatically collected by a Tecan Genesis 200 robot. Selected cells were passaged twice and transferred to an agar plate before PCR amplification of the library inserts. After DNA sequencing and sequence blasting, all bait-prey interactions were assessed for intrinsic prey promiscuities by comparison with in house databases containing prey information on binding frequencies obtained from previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Albers1">[53]</xref>.

Each experiment was performed at least three times in four replicate wells. Spreading was quantified manually in a blinded manner and mean neurite length was quantified using the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). The mean neurite length is referred to as the mean total length of all neurites per cell. 3T3 cells were classified as spread cells if they bear at least two lammelipodial processes longer than one cell body diameter. Round cells were classified as non-spread. Data were normalized to baseline and plotted as average ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Cells were imaged with a Leica DM5500B microscope equipped with HCX PL FL Dry 10×/0.3 and 20×/0.5 objectives in a semi-automated way. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism5 using a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> test or by using an unpaired Student's t-test.

<title>Hippocampus</title>
<p>Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from 40–60 day old (P40–P60) WT C57BL/6 mice or Nogo-A<sup>−/−</sup> mice according to standard procedures. In brief, mice were anesthetized and decapitated; the brain was quickly transferred into ice-cold carbogenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Hippocampi were cut with a vibratome (400 µm; VT 1000S; Leica). The ACSF used for electrophysiological recordings contained 125 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM glucose. Recordings were done at 32°C.</p>
<p>Blockade of S1PR2 was achieved by incubation of acute slices with JTE-013, blockade of S1PR1, 3, 4, 5 with FTY-720 and blockade of S1PR1, 3 with VPC-23019, respectively. The inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and freshly added at a final concentration of 5 µM, 1 µM, and 0.1 µM, respectively, to the carbogenated ACSF. The DMSO overall concentration in the ACSF was kept at 0.01%. As control DMSO alone was added. In order to compare the data with previous experiments silicon tubing was used, and pre-washed with ACSF containing BSA (0.1 mg/ml). The slices were pre-incubated for 1 h (or 10 min for the experiments in which JTE-013 and 11c7 were combined) with the inhibitor or DMSO as control in an incubation chamber maintaining a constant flow of the solution. During the experiments the inhibitor was also around. For the electrophysiological recordings, the perfusion rate in the recording chamber was constantly kept at 1.5 ml/min.</p>
<p>After placing the slices in a submerged recording chamber field, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region with a glass micropipette (resistance 3–15 MΩ filled with 3 M NaCl at a depth of ∼100 µm. Monopolar tungsten electrodes were used for stimulating the Schaffer collaterals at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Stimulation was set to elicit a fEPSP with a slope of ∼40%–50% of maximum for LTP recordings. After 20 min baseline stimulation LTP was induced by applying theta-burst stimulation (TBS), in which a burst consisted of four pulses at 100 Hz. These were repeated 10 times in 200 ms intervals (5 Hz). Three such trains were used to induce LTP at 0.1 Hz. Basic synaptic transmission and presynaptic properties were analyzed <italic>via</italic> I/O measurements and paired pulse facilitation. The I/O measurements were performed either by application of a defined value of current (25–250 µA in steps of 25 µA) or by adjusting the stimulus intensity to a certain current eliciting a fiber volley (FV) of desired voltage. Paired pulse facilitation was performed by applying a pair of two stimuli in different inter-stimulus-intervals (ISIs), ranging from 10, 20, 40, and 80 to 160 ms. Data were collected, stored, and analyzed with LABVIEW software (National Instruments). The initial slope of fEPSPs elicited by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals was measured over time, normalized to baseline, and plotted as average ± SEM.</p>

<title>Motor cortex</title>
<p>For LTP measurements in the motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Tews1">[11]</xref>, coronal slices containing the forelimb are of M1 (1–2 mm anterior to the bregma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Donoghue1">[63]</xref>), and were prepared from adult Sprague Dawley rats (180–220 g). JTE-013 concentrations were used according to protocols used for hippocampal slices and added to the ACSF: 126 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM glucose, bubbled with a 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> mixture at 33±0.5°C). To allow optimal JTE-013 penetration, responses were recorded from the slice superface of layer II/III within M1. Basic synaptic transmission was analyzed with I/O analysis. I/O measurements were conducted by applying a value of current, which elicited a minimal (threshold) evoked response (0.2–0.3 mV). I/O curves were obtained by averaging field potential peak amplitudes of three responses to stimuli of two, three, four, and five times the threshold response. To elicit the maximum amplitude that could be evoked, we used a stimulation intensity of 25× threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-RioultPedotti1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-RioultPedotti2">[65]</xref>. For baseline measurements, stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce responses 40%–50% of the maximum amplitude. For data analysis, we computed the amplitude of the field potential response because it serves as a measure of the population excitatory synaptic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-RioultPedotti2">[65]</xref>, reflects a monosynaptic current sink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hess1">[66]</xref>, and correlates well with the intracellular excitatory postsynaptic response evoked in this pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Aroniadou1">[67]</xref>. Measurement of the field potential slope, as routinely used, e.g., in the hippocampus, has not been used for neocortical field potential responses due to the interference of the response's initial part by variable nonsynaptic components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hess2">[68]</xref>. After 20 min of baseline stimulation, focal and transient reduction of y-aminobuturic acid-A (GABA) inhibition at the recording site was produced by applying bicuculline methiodide (3.3 mM, Tocris Bioscience) from a micropipette by touching the tip to the slice surface within 100 µm of the recording microelectrode for 15–60 s. The pipette was removed when the amplitude of test responses increased 50%–100% of baseline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hess1">[66]</xref>. Immediately after bicuculline application, LTP was attempted by delivering TBS at double baseline stimulation intensity. LTP induction was attempted by using TBS, which consisted of 10 trains of stimuli at 5 Hz. Each train was composed of four pulses at 100 Hz. This sequence was delivered every 10 s for a total of five presentations. LTP was recorded for at least 20 min after it reached a stable plateau. TBS was induced until responses were saturated. Pathways were considered saturated if the difference between two subsequent states of LTP were not significantly different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001763-Hess2">[68]</xref>. Maximum LTP was calculated as a percentage of baseline, plotted as average ± SEM and analyzed by a Student's t-test. Data were collected, stored, and analyzed with LABVIEW (National Instruments) and MATLAB (MathWorks) software.</p>
