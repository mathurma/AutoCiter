<abstract>
<p>The evolutionary stability of cooperative traits, that are beneficial to other individuals but costly to their carrier, is considered possible only through the establishment of a sufficient degree of assortment between cooperators. Chimeric microbial populations, characterized by simple interactions between unrelated individuals, restrain the applicability of standard mechanisms generating such assortment, in particular when cells disperse between successive reproductive events such as happens in Dicyostelids and Myxobacteria. In this paper, we address the evolutionary dynamics of a costly trait that enhances attachment to others as well as group cohesion. By modeling cells as self-propelled particles moving on a plane according to local interaction forces and undergoing cycles of aggregation, reproduction and dispersal, we show that blind differential adhesion provides a basis for assortment in the process of group formation. When reproductive performance depends on the social context of players, evolution by natural selection can lead to the success of the social trait, and to the concomitant emergence of sizeable groups. We point out the conditions on the microscopic properties of motion and interaction that make such evolutionary outcome possible, stressing that the advent of sociality by differential adhesion is restricted to specific ecological contexts. Moreover, we show that the aggregation process naturally implies the existence of non-aggregated particles, and highlight their crucial evolutionary role despite being largely neglected in theoretical models for the evolution of sociality.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Although pervasive in the living world, collective behavior is a puzzle for evolutionary biology. The genetic traits that sustain it are costly for their carriers and make them vulnerable to the exploitation of asocial “free-riders” that benefit from the group without contributing to its cohesion. This paradox has spawned an extensive literature mainly concerned with elaborate cooperative behaviors that might be inoperant for simple biological entities such as microbes. We model successive life cycles of aggregation, reproduction and dispersal in a biological population combining a statistical physics approach to mimic the group formation process and an evolutionary game theory approach to account for the conflict between individual competition and collective success. Our results show a parsimonious way to the advent of sociality based on differential physical adhesion in organisms deprived of complex cognitive abilities. We also stress the key role of ungrouped individuals and specify the conditions on motion properties that make sociality possible. In detailing a mechanism akin to promote social behavior in microbes in the absence of genealogical relatedness, our work might shed light on both the maintenance of facultative multicellular lifestyles and the evolutionary origins of multicellularity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to form and sustain collective ventures is observed at all levels of the living world, spanning from human societies to microbial populations. In many biological settings, grouping requires individual traits that are costly for their carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Velicer1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Xavier1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Schtickzelle1">[3]</xref>. Sociality is thus an apparent paradox of evolutionary theory, as asocial “cheaters” who do not contribute to social welfare but reap group benefits should be favored by natural selection. This issue, that was first raised by Charles Darwin, has been revived in the last decades and is still pivotal in evolutionary biology, giving rise to an extensive literature on the evolution of cooperation.</p>
<p>The difficulty to explain the evolutionary emergence and maintenance of cooperation is particularly acute when the organisms diplaying social behavior are relatively simple such as microbes, so that they cannot rely on the complex cognitive and cultural abilities that are usually invoked as supporting cooperation in animals. Such simpler interactions and behaviors, together with the ease of cultivating bacterial populations in controlled environments, offer on the other hand the opportunity to address elementary mechanisms that underlie the evolution of sociality in general settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Velicer1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Crespi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-West1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Celiker1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we consider the evolution of a social (adhesive and cooperative) trait in populations of organisms with a life cycle of aggregation-reproduction-dispersal, commonly observed in microbes displaying high degrees of cooperation, such as social amoebae or Myxobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-West1">[5]</xref>. In such cases, the existence of recurrent chimeric aggregates of potentially unrelated individuals appears to contrast with the classic expectation that cooperative behavior should be expressed to a lesser extent the weaker the genetical relatedness within social groups. We make the aggregation phase explicit by modeling cells as self-propelled particles moving on a plane, and we study under which conditions social traits evolve through natural selection, and to what spatial patterns they are associated.</p>
<p>Game theory has been long used to account for the evolutionary sustainability of genetically determined cooperative traits that benefit others while being costly to the individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Hofbauer1">[7]</xref>. Several different formalizations have been proposed that describe the effect of an individual's trait and its interactions on its own reproductive success. Among those, cooperation in social settings is classically modeled with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-players games, where fitness depends on the features of the group. The simplest formulation of such games is the Public Goods Game (PGG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Olson1">[8]</xref>, where the benefits yielded by the group depend on the fraction of cooperators in it.</p>
<p>In questioning the mechanisms by which cooperative behavior can prosper, most models consider environments where group size is constant and independent of individual strategies. A growing number of studies has recently started to address cases when the interaction topology, and notably the size of the social groups, is an emergent property of individual-level features. These studies have modeled specific rules for entering groups with limited carrying capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Avils1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-vanVeelen1">[10]</xref>; evolvable preferences for group size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Powers1">[11]</xref>; competition for the use of a diffusible compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Nadell1">[12]</xref>, or for empty space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Pfeiffer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Hauert1">[14]</xref>; the voluntary participation to groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Hauert2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Hauert3">[16]</xref>; but also differential attachment supported by the cooperative trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Pacheco1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Garcia1">[18]</xref>. In many cases however, group formation has been modeled in well-mixed populations, or on a regular lattice where each individual occupies a cell and has a constant number of partners. While these assumptions are justified whenever individuals are either extremely motile or sessile respectively, they fall short in describing self-structuring traits in microbial populations with complex grouping patterns. More realistic models for the formation of groups from initially sparse individuals thus require an explicit account of particle movement in space and of the interaction forces that underpin the emergent “social landscape”.</p>
<p>With this respect, Self-Propelled Particles (SPP) models have proved useful to account for the formation of collective structures (e.g. swarms) based on simple local rules for interaction. Although SPP models have now become a primary tool to address collective behavior both in the physical and biological sciences, the exploration of their interplay with the evolutionary dynamics of individual traits is still in its infancy (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Guttal1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Chen1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Chen2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Zhang1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Perc1">[23]</xref>). In this work, we explore the conditions for a genetic costly trait that enhances interactions to evolve in a population, in a context where the aggregation scheme is explicit and the ecological and evolutionary timescales are separated. In the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>, we define a SPP model in which particles exert interaction forces on their neighbors whose intensities differ according to their strategies, social (<bold>S</bold>) or asocial (<bold>A</bold>). After a fixed number of timesteps, individuals are assigned a fitness according to their strategy and the cohesiveness of their group. In the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>, we discuss the ecological dynamics of aggregation and the evolutionary trajectories of the social frequency across generations in this setting. Finally, we highlight the key role of microscopic parameters on the evolutionary dynamics, and stress that sociality might be promoted only in specific ecological contexts.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>In this section, we motivate and describe our model, which combines a Self Propelled Particles framework and a linear Public Goods Game. Cells are modeled as a population of particles differing in their adhesineveness that undergo successive cycles of aggregation, reproduction and dispersion, so that groups are “ephemeral”, and not persistent, structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-GodfreySmith1">[24]</xref>. Such description is not only relevant to understand the evolution of facultative multicellular microbes, it also provides a “thought experiment” to test hypotheses on the origins of multicellularity itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Michod1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-GodfreySmith2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Sachs1">[27]</xref>. In the case when groups are persistent, the evolution of cooperation is made easier by mechanisms such as colony growth, low dispersal and incomplete separation after cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Nadell1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Kmmerli1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Koschwanez1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-VanDyken1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Within a cycle, the aggregation phase is ruled by a SPP, and is followed by a reproduction phase where particles leave offspring according to their payoff in a PGG. Particles are then dispersed, so that interactions in the following generation bear no memory of their previous positions. At the following generation, groups are thus formed again by genetically unrelated individuals. Iterating this cycle across many generations, we compute the evolutionary trajectory of the social trait.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Aggregation model</title>
<p>We design a minimal model for collective motion that represents microbial populations with self-propelled particles moving on a plane. This kind of models has been widely explored in statistical physics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Vicsek1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Grgoire1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Grgoire2">[33]</xref>), demonstrating that simple short-range interactions are sufficient to achieve spatial repartition of particles (typically of one single type) into clusters.</p>
<p>More in particular, it draws inspiration from Myxobacteria and Dictyostelids, that upon nutrient exhaustion abandon a solitary lifestyle to form multicellular aggregates. Even though interactions between cells are very complex, and several models have directly addressed specific features (e.g. the role of cyclic AMP oscillations and chemotaxis in the aggregation of <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Guven1">[34]</xref>, or that of the rod shape in <italic>Myxococcus xantus</italic> streaming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Peruani1">[35]</xref>), the present model retains only few essential characteristics of the aggregation process and investigates their evolutionary consequences.</p>
<p>In the absence of interaction, cells display a persistent random walk – i.e. with correlation between successive step directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Codling1">[36]</xref> – as shown correct for the vegetative phase of Dictyostelium life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Li1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Gol1">[38]</xref>, the directed and stochastic components being modeled here by force and noise terms respectively. The interaction forces may result from chemotaxis or adhesion proteins at the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Coates1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Natural microbial populations display differences in interaction modes (for instance, in stickiness or responsiveness to chemotaxis), that are often associated with differences in the capacity of specific strains to be overrepresented in spores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Strassmann1">[40]</xref>. Our modeled populations are composed of particles of two types –“social” (<bold>S</bold>) and “asocial” (<bold>A</bold>) – that have distinct interaction forces intensities, <bold>S</bold> particles being more attractive than <bold>A</bold> particles. The interaction strategy is deemed genetically encoded and unconditional. Previous models in which self-propelled particles differ in some microscopic feature (e.g. adhesion or motility) have been designed to study cell sorting within tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Belmonte1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Beatrici1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Zhang2">[43]</xref>, where the phase of aggregation from a dispersed initial condition was irrelevant.</p>
<p>We consider a population of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> particles, either <bold>S</bold> or <bold>A</bold>, moving on a square of side <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with periodic boundaries. Irrespective of the orientation of their velocity vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, particles move all at the same speed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, reflecting the inherent ability of propulsion of cells. Every particle has a finite spatial extension and exerts an interaction force on other particles as a function of their distances, as one would expect from physical adhesion and volume exclusion. Let us consider a particle indexed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A second particle <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exerts a force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a unitary vector directed from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) upon the focal particle <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

After aggregation, the population is segmented into groups according to a criterion described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003482.s001">Text S1</xref> of the Supplementary Information (SI). Such clustering algorithm allows us to attribute to each particle the size of the group it belongs to, as well as the number of <bold>S</bold> particles within this group.

<p>Once aggregation is over, the reproductive success of every particle is determined as its payoff in a PGG played within its group. The PGG is a simple form of social game, that gives rise to the so-called tragedy of the commons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Rankin1">[45]</xref>: individuals who contribute to the public good are disadvantaged with regard to non-contributing co-members, even though gains are maximal when everybody takes part to the common endeavor. The common good at stake here is group cohesion itself, so that the payoff individuals derive from their group depends on the proportion of <bold>S</bold> members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Garcia1">[18]</xref>. Sociality thus plays a role both in the aggregation process and in the performance of groups. This assumption is consistent with what happens in several social microorganisms, where cell adhesion is a major factor determining the cohesiveness (and as a consequence, the viability) of cell aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Ponte1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Smukalla1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Velicer2">[48]</xref>. Equivalent assumptions have also been made in the theoretical literature e.g. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Simon1">[49]</xref>: there, adhesive social cells entail higher group sizes and large groups are supposed more viable than small ones, leading to the maintenance of sticky cells through the interplay of the individual and the group levels.</p>
<p>In the simplest form of a PGG, each <bold>S</bold> contributes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to group cohesion at a cost <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to its reproductive success, whereas <bold>A</bold>s neither contribute nor pay a cost.

<p>At the end of the generation, the resulting population is dispersed: the position and orientation of each particle is randomly assigned at the beginning of the next generation's aggregation phase.

<p>Precising the process by which particles interact and form groups allows us to study the interplay of the ecological timescale – relative to the aggregation phase – and the evolutionary timescale, over which the frequencies of social and asocial strategies change in the population. In the following sections, we will examine these timescales separately and eventually discuss what are the features at the particle level that support the evolution of sociality, and to what population structures this evolution is associated. First, we focus on the outcome of the aggregation step within one generation. Then, we address the evolutionary dynamics of the social trait across generations and highlights the role of <italic>assortment</italic> and <italic>volatility</italic> in determining the success of the social strategy. Finally, we describe the dependence of the evolutionary equilibrium on microscopic parameters of motion and interaction.</p>

Our simulations being halted before the asymptotic state is reached, we are focusing on the clustering of the population into groups that occurs on a fast timescale, and we neglect all features such as group diffusion, merging and internal reassortment that occur on longer timescales. Slow relaxation to the asymptotic state mainly induces sorting within groups, which in our model has no fitness effect, hence no qualitative effect on the evolutionary outcomes.</p>
<p>The population forms groups in a broad range of the parameter space, but the size distribution of the groups and the proportions of grouped vs. free particles depend on the ecological parameters ruling particle motion and interaction. We refer to the online Supplementary material for movies showing simulations of the process of group formation. These movies bear a strong resemblance with low magnification movies of the aggregation of <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, where initially dispersed cells form clumps of different sizes, while some cells keep moving outside the aggregates.</p>
<p>The population remains scattered and no group is recognizable when directed motion overcomes the interaction forces. This occurs when the interaction cut-off radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is short; the population density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is small; the noise level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is high; the velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large. Otherwise, local fluctuations are amplified and particles start to cluster until a quasi-steady state is reached where most particles are clumped into groups of different sizes and densities, while some particles move in the “gas” phase between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003482-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Within groups, each particle vibrates around an equilibrium position corresponding to the balance between all attractive and repulsive forces exerted by its neighbors, plus the noise component. Groups typically have a circular shape and are separated by a distance of the same order of magnitude as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Assortment and differential volatility between strategies drive the evolution of sociality</title>
<p>On the evolutionary timescale, the fate of the social type hinges upon the emergent structure of the population after the aggregation process. In our simulations of the evolutionary dynamics, the population always stabilizes to a monomorphic equilibrium, either fully social or fully asocial. This is probably the consequence of the simple linear form of the PGG, which generally does not support the coexistence of different strategies. The population structure that is achieved at the evolutionary equilibrium depends on the microscopic features of the dominant particle type, and falls under three categories: asocial and grouped; asocial and dispersed; social and grouped. A fully social dispersed equilibrium is always evolutionarily unstable: indeed, if <bold>S</bold> particles are unable to form clusters, they do not get any group benefits and are thus defeated by <bold>A</bold> particles that do not pay the cost of sociality. In the case of a fully asocial equilibrium, the population can either remain dispersed or grouped, depending on the ecological parameters.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003482-g003">Figure 3</xref> recapitulates the evolutionary dynamics observed in the cases when sociality takes over the population.

The evolutionary feedback on the ecological timescale thus boosts <bold>S</bold> particles, that in turn give rise to larger groups, and ultimately leads to the fixation of sociality in the population. When <bold>S</bold>s are rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003482-g003">Figure 3b</xref>), group cohesion is low and most of the particles remain ungrouped.

<p>The condition for <bold>S</bold>s to be favored over <bold>A</bold>s depends on the game parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as well as on the emergent population structure shaped by the ecological parameters (form and intensity of the forces, population size and density, noise level, velocity, radii of interactions) that govern the relative importance of diffusion (the persistent random motion) vs. cohesion (the interaction forces). If non-linear payoff functions are chosen, the evolutionary success of sociality may as well depend on other game parameters, e.g. a threshold to activate the public goods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Archetti1">[50]</xref> or a synergy/discounting rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Hauert4">[51]</xref>. Once the population structure is known, however, such condition can be expressed in terms of the evolutionary parameters and of two aggregated observables that quantify statistically the effect of population structure on particle assortment.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Garcia1">[18]</xref>, we can derive a simple condition for sociality to be favored in a population after aggregation. Let us define <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (resp. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) the proportion of <bold>S</bold> (resp. <bold>A</bold>) particles that remain <italic>ungrouped</italic> at the end of the aggregation step, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (resp. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) the average fraction of <bold>S</bold>s experienced in the group of a focal <bold>S</bold> (resp. <bold>A</bold>) particle.

<p>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> term in the LHS corresponds to the average marginal gain an <bold>S</bold> particle gets from its own contribution in the PGG within its group. The frequency of sociality therefore increases at the next generation as soon as the aggregation process entails sufficient differences in <italic>assortment</italic> (i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large enough) or <italic>volatility</italic> (i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large enough) between <bold>S</bold>s and <bold>A</bold>s.</p>
<p>Such two macroscopic quantities can be in principle measured experimentally in microbial populations by mixing two strains stained with different fluorescent markers.

<title>Parameters of motion and interaction condition the evolution of sociality</title>
<p>Sociality can get established as an effect of the feedback between ecological processes – linked to the emergence of particle aggregates – and the evolutionary change in frequencies of each type: it is favored when the microscopic aggregation parameters create a sufficient degree of assortment within groups and enhance group volatility. We explore now when these conditions are met as a function of four fundamental parameters underpinning particle motion and interaction: noise intensity, particle velocity, interaction radius and population density. The effects of changes in particle diameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be also understood based on this analysis, since its value is directly obtained by rescaling the other parameters. Although in some cases random mutations and finite-size fluctuations are sufficient to cause the evolutionary invasion of social particles, most often the initial fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <bold>S</bold>s must exceed a threshold in order for the positive eco-evolutionary feedback to get established. Therefore, we initialized the system with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The diagrams in this section illustrate how qualitatively different regimes can be attained as the microscopic parameters are changed, and how two different kinds of transitions between them are understandable with regard to the emergent population structure.</p>
<sec id="s3c1">
<title>Noise intensity</title>
<p>The noise parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> quantifies the extent to which random perturbations override the interaction forces between particles. A value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to the case when a particle's direction at each timestep is completely determined by its current direction and the total force exerted by its neighbors. Conversely, a value of 1 means that its direction is chosen uniformly randomly within the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so that the particle undergoes uncorrelated Brownian motion. A sharp transition is observed between a regime of clustered, highly social populations when noise is low and a regime where the population remains dispersed and asocial when the noise exceeds a threshold value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003482-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the first phase, noise is low enough to keep <bold>S</bold> particles together once they have joined a group, as they are bound by strong interactions forces. On the same timescale, instead, <bold>A</bold> particles, that are linked by weaker interactions, aggregate less (thus collecting less often group benefits than <bold>S</bold>s), and experience less social group environments when they do. Above the noise threshold, particles of any type become detached from each other and the population is highly volatile, as reflected by the concomitant drop in group sizes.</p>

<p>A certain level of inertia is thus required for a social variant to be selected in a population. This suggests that turbulent environments might be less favorable to the establishment of social behavior also because they hinder the formation of groups, other than because they offer a smaller number of niches to drive the evolution of more adapted types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Rainey1">[61]</xref>.</p>

<p>The same effect observed for high values of noise also occurs for high velocities, that make interaction forces insufficient to hinder volatility. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003482-g005">Figure 5</xref> displays the same kind of transition from dispersed, asocial evolutionary equilibria to grouped, social populations as the velocity decreases. However, a transition of different nature can be seen when the velocity is diminished further. Groups keep forming when particles are slow, but their composition is mostly determined by the positions of particles before aggregation, and is thus close to random assortment.

<p>The conflict between diffusion and cohesion (i.e., between speed of movement and interaction forces) thus results in a range of velocities where <bold>S</bold> particles are assorted and poorly volatile, while <bold>A</bold> particles are strongly volatile. Elsewhere, either <bold>S</bold>s are too poorly assorted, or the population is too volatile. This suggests that the environments that promote social adhesion are those that are neither too fluid nor too viscous. These results are consistent with other recent studies: Meloni and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Meloni1">[62]</xref> discuss a model in which agents move freely with constant speed on a 2D-plane (thus with no interaction forces between them) and play a prisoner's dilemma game with their closest neighbors at each timestep. They found that high velocities are detrimental to the evolution of cooperation, as the neighborhood of each particle then resembles a well-mixed population. The effect of velocity on the evolutionary dynamics is even closer to our model when the game is changed to a PGG, showing a similar rise-and-fall pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Cardillo1">[63]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The evolution of social behavior is a riddle for evolutionary biology because of the disruptive power of within-group competition between individuals that invest or not in the public good. In microbes and in the early stages of the transition to multicellularity, most mechanisms that sustain coperation through the use of cognitive abilities are ruled out. On the other hand, genetic relatedness may not be the only driver of the evolution of collective behavior, since microbial aggregates are commonly observed even when cells of potentially different origins come together. Here, we have explored one possible mechanism that allows the evolution of sociality and sizeable groups, when sticky self-propelled particles moving on a plane are assigned a fitness that depends on their social environment. The emergent structure of the population, underpinned by the adhesion forces between particles, feeds back onto the evolutionary dynamics of more or less adhesive types. By analyzing a model that comprises successive cycles of aggregation-reproduction-dispersal, we have shown that sociality gets established in a limited range of parameter values: intermediate particle velocities; intermediate interaction radii; sufficient persistence in the particle directed movement; intermediate densities. These results can be understood in terms of two features of the population structure: assortment within groups and volatility, both of which affect the average fitness of particles with different interaction forces.</p>
<p>Assortment among types has long been pointed out as a requirement for the evolution of costly cooperative behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Fletcher1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Wilson1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Fletcher3">[65]</xref>). However, experimentalists as well as theorists still debate on how such assortment is actually reached when genealogic relatedness does not appear to play a central role. Most solutions involve some kind of recognition of other individuals' strategies, or at least information about a variable correlated with the strategy: a “green beard” gene coding for both the character, the recognition of copies of the genes among partners and preferential interaction with their carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Dawkins1">[66]</xref>; partner choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Kun1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Andr1">[68]</xref>; conditional strategies involving choosiness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-McNamara1">[69]</xref>; matching by group size preference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Powers1">[11]</xref>; direct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Trivers1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Axelrod1">[71]</xref> or indirect/generalized reciprocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Nowak1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Wedekind1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Pfeiffer2">[74]</xref>, etc. Here, we describe a mechanistic process by which particles are endowed with attractive forces that are independent of the social context. Assortment occurs with no need to assume that <bold>S</bold> particles attach <italic>preferentially</italic> with other <bold>S</bold>s; only <italic>differential</italic> attachment of <bold>S</bold>s and <bold>A</bold>s is required. This important distinction has been alluded to or stressed in several recent works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Garcia1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Smukalla1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Strassmann2">[75]</xref>. Ultimately, <bold>S</bold> particles enjoy the advantages of group cohesion to a larger extent, to the point that they can offset the cost of sociality.</p>
<p>Volatility is a much more neglected factor to achieve distinct reproductive successes for each type. Differential volatility means that asocials are less prone to be in a group, or at least more loosely stuck to the group; therefore, more likely to get no group benefits or a lesser share of them. Surprisingly, the possibility that individuals do not participate in any group has been overlooked in models of the evolution of cooperation. In the papers that did, being alone results either from an encoded strategy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Hauert2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Hauert3">[16]</xref>) or to coercion by cooperators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Sasaki1">[76]</xref>, rather than being a by-product of an explicit group formation process. Recently, detailed models of motion began to be implemented in evolutionary models that allow in principle for the existence of lonely individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Meloni1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Cardillo1">[63]</xref>. Indeed, in many actual group-structured biological populations, a proportion of individuals typically fail to join any group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Smukalla1">[47]</xref>. We stress that, as soon as the proportion of ungrouped particles differ for both types, the evolutionary dynamics is affected in favor of the more strongly aggregating type. In our model, differential volatility occurs as the cooperative trait is related to grouping ability itself, as stronger adhesion forces confer cohesiveness to groups but also enhance individual attachment. Any cooperative trait increasing the probability to end up in a group would yield qualitatively similar results: socials and asocials may be defined on the basis of differences in properties other than attachment, e.g. their interaction radius.</p>
<p>In general, assortment and volatility are not independent features of the emergent population structure. In our simulations, the faculty for <bold>S</bold> particles to become positively assorted comes along with a lesser tendency to be left alone by the aggregation process. However, it is noteworthy that, in situations when sociality is the winning strategy, positive assortment alone may not be sufficient to account for its advantage. Indeed, assuming that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the two conditions 1) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e149a" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e149b" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (assortment alone is not enough to favor sociality) and 2) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (assortment+differential volatility combined favor sociality) are compatible as soon as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003482.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this case, differential volatility drives the rise in frequency of sociality, while it would not be the case discounting singletons. This suggests that in real settings where group size is distributed and not fixed, models and experiments might overestimate the constraints for cooperative behavior to be favored. While positive assortment and differential volatility are two complementary effects that promote sociality, they both stem from the biologically plausible hypothesis that a character may affect the expected group size distribution. Examples of traits regulating group size are known in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Gol1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-RoisinBouffay1">[77]</xref>, although their effects on the group size distribution have to our knowledge never been quantified.</p>
<p>We highlighted that parameters related to particle motion are key in the evolutionary success of social individuals. Noise, velocity, density and interaction radius must be restricted to specific ranges for sociality to be able to take over the population; otherwise asociality dominates. In actual biological settings, these parameters might have co-evolved with adhesion properties, and their evolutionary dynamics may be explored with a multi-trait model.</p>
<p>With our model, we show that observing and quantifying the properties of the population structure generated by a given mixture of strains may inform on the mechanisms that underlie the evolutionary process. The issue of being able to count a large amount of aggregates (so that statistics are reliable) can be overcome by means of microscopes screening a large surface and still maintaining a single-cell resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Houchmandzadeh1">[78]</xref>. Our analysis indicates what are the patterns that one would expect if the evolutionary experiments were carried out under different environmental conditions that affect cell-level properties, such as cell density or substrate hardness (that condition cell movement). More importantly, they indicate two statistics that may predict if a given population would evolve towards more or less sociality.</p>
<p>Although unicellular organisms are often found in large aggregates, their high dispersal abilities and the consequent mixing of genotypes makes the establishment and maintenance of social behavior apparently paradoxical. When physical mechanisms underlying the formation of groups are made explicit, however, the evolution of sociality looks less mysterious, and one can start asking quantitative questions on the processes that led to the emergence of cellular aggregates. The simple model presented here can be enriched with further details implementing additional features of microbial organisms, such as alignment terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Vicsek1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Grgoire2">[33]</xref>, an explicit account of the cell shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Peruani1">[35]</xref> and chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Jiang1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003482-Calovi1">[80]</xref>. The exploration of the mechanistic role of cell-cell interaction in shaping the social structure is a fundamental step to understand altruism in microbes, as well as the possible evolutionary paths towards multicellularity.</p>
