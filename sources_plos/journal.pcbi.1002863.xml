      <abstract>
        <p>Recent analyses of human-associated bacterial diversity have categorized individuals into ‘enterotypes’ or clusters based on the abundances of key bacterial genera in the gut microbiota. There is a lack of consensus, however, on the analytical basis for enterotypes and on the interpretation of these results. We tested how the following factors influenced the detection of enterotypes: clustering methodology, distance metrics, OTU-picking approaches, sequencing depth, data type (whole genome shotgun (WGS) vs.16S rRNA gene sequence data), and 16S rRNA region. We included 16S rRNA gene sequences from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and from 16 additional studies and WGS sequences from the HMP and MetaHIT. In most body sites, we observed smooth abundance gradients of key genera without discrete clustering of samples. Some body habitats displayed bimodal (<italic>e.g.</italic>, gut) or multimodal (<italic>e.g.</italic>, vagina) distributions of sample abundances, but not all clustering methods and workflows accurately highlight such clusters. Because identifying enterotypes in datasets depends not only on the structure of the data but is also sensitive to the methods applied to identifying clustering strength, we recommend that multiple approaches be used and compared when testing for enterotypes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Recent work has suggested that individuals can be classified into ‘enterotypes’ based on the abundance of key bacterial taxa in gut microbial communities. However, the generality of enterotypes across populations, and the existence of similar cluster types for other body sites, remains to be evaluated. We combined the Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene sequence data and metagenomes with similar published data to assess the existence of enterotypes across body sites. We found that rather than forming enterotypes (note we use this term for clusters in all body sites), most samples fell into gradients based on taxonomic abundances of bacteria such as <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, although in some body sites there is a bi/multi modal distribution of samples across gradients. Furthermore, many of the methods used in the analysis (<italic>e.g.</italic>, distance metrics and clustering approaches) affected the likelihood of identifying enterotypes in particular body habitats. We recommend that multiple approaches be used and compared when testing for enterotypes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Together with the MetaHIT consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Qin1">[1]</xref>, the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) represents one of the first major attempts to define the microbial diversity comprising the “normal healthy” human microbiome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-The1">[2]</xref>. The HMP dataset includes 16S rRNA gene sequence data of roughly twice the size of all similarly derived data in previously published studies, effectively tripling the size of combined data available for comparative studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s031">Table S1</xref>). In addition, the HMP generated whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic data for a subset of individuals. These data allowed for the characterization of patterns of microbial diversity across body sites and between individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-The1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The HMP data also provides an opportunity to test the generality of the concept of enterotypes in the human microbiome. Arumugam <italic>et al.</italic> first articulated the concept of enterotypes as robust clustering of human gut samples based on microbial community composition, and largely driven by the abundances of key bacterial genera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Arumugam1">[3]</xref>. Although the term ‘enterotype’ refers to microbiota types within the gut, the concept can be applied generally, and here, for convenience, we use the term ‘enterotype’ to refer to microbiota types across different body sites. The HMP data are ideally suited to test the robustness of the enterotype concept in multiple body sites, and together with recently published community-generated datasets, across multiple populations.</p>
      <p>In this report, we combined 16S rRNA gene sequence data generated using next-generation sequencing by the scientific community (hereafter, ‘community data’) together with the MetaHIT WGS data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Arumugam1">[3]</xref> and the recently released HMP 16S rRNA gene sequence data and WGS data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-The1">[2]</xref>. Because there is currently no community standard for testing for enterotypes, we explore how the detection of enterotypes is affected by the following: clustering methodology, distance metrics, OTU-picking approaches, sequencing depth (<italic>i.e.</italic>, rarefaction), data type (16S rRNA vs. WGS), and the specific region of the 16S rRNA gene sequenced. We find that the emergence of enterotypes is sensitive to the community structure of communities within each body site, and importantly also to the analysis methods employed. Our comparative analysis of various approaches across datasets informs the discussion on the technical basis for enterotyping and on how to interpret enterotype results.</p>

        <title>16S rRNA Gene Sequence Processing</title>
        <p>We constructed a database containing the recently released HMP 16S rRNA gene sequence data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-The2">[4]</xref> and publically available (published) human microbiome datasets (community data). For inclusion, community datasets were required to contain a minimum of 25 samples per study and sequences generated using the Roche 454 platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s031">Table S1</xref>). The majority of samples were from healthy controls; however, a small subset of samples was derived from subjects that differed from adult healthy subjects due to age (<italic>i.e</italic>., infants and the elderly), use of antibiotics, or possible presence of disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We acquired raw SFF files and metadata files containing the unique identifiers for each sample within a study (barcodes) from the authors and re-processed the data using the default settings in the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) analysis pipeline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Caporaso1">[5]</xref>. For the majority of samples, quality filtering consisted of rejecting reads &lt;200 nt and &gt;1000 nt, excluding homopolymer runs &gt;6 nt, accepting 0 barcode corrections and 0 primer mismatches; two datasets were processed with slightly different screening parameters, as described in their respective publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-DeFilippo1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Dethlefsen1">[7]</xref>. When picking operational taxonomic units (OTUs) we used the OTU tables generated by the HMP, which were created <italic>de novo</italic>. Because the regions of the 16S rRNA gene differed between studies (and within: the HMP sequenced both V1–V3 and V3–V5 regions), we used a reference-based approach (hence, we did not denoise the data) to pick OTUs at 97% pairwise identity using as a reference the latest release of the GreenGenes (GG) taxonomy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-McDonald1">[8]</xref>. We also used the phylogenetic tree from GG to calculate weighted (abundance based) and unweighted (presence/absence based) UniFrac distances between communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Lozupone1">[9]</xref>, after applying two rarefactions (1,000 and 2,000 sequences/sample) to standardize sequence counts. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was applied to the distance matrices for visualization.</p>

        <p>The HMP and MetaHIT shotgun metagenomic datasets were taxonomically profiled using MetaPhlAn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Segata1">[10]</xref> (version 1.1, default parameter settings), which infers relative abundances for all taxonomic levels (from phyla to species) for Bacteria and Archaea. We performed standard quality control on the HMP and MetaHIT samples as reported in the original studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-The1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Arumugam1">[3]</xref> - other metagenomic pre-processing steps (<italic>e.g.</italic>, error detection, assembly, or gene annotation) are not required by MetaPhlAn.

        <title>Enterotyping</title>
        <p>To evaluate the clustering results in the context of previously published results reporting enterotypes, we merged publicly available data (genus relative abundance tables) from MetaHIT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Arumugam1">[3]</xref> with data for the 16S rRNA-based HMP and non-HMP samples, based on genus-level taxonomy assignments. We performed enterotype testing using the relative abundances of OTUs (rarified at 1,000 sequences/sample for the majority of analyses, except where effect of rarefaction was tested specifically), to which we applied five distance metrics: Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), Root Jensen-Shannon divergence (rJSD), Bray-Curtis (BC), and weighted/unweighted UniFrac distances. For the calculation of JSD and BC distances, we first binned the counts of OTUs at the desired level (95% and 97% ID for genus and species level OTUs, respectively). We used the R “vegan” package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Oksanen1">[11]</xref> for calculating the Bray-Curtis distance according to this formula for the distance between samples <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic>, with taxa/OTUs indexed by <italic>i</italic>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002863.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002863.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Clustering was performed via partitioning around medoids in the R package “cluster” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Maechler1">[12]</xref>. We chose the number of clusters and quality of the resulting clusters by maximizing the prediction strength (PS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Tibshirani1">[13]</xref> and silhouette index (SI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Rousseeuw1">[14]</xref>. We applied a criterion of ≥0.90 for PS to signify strong clustering (this implies that 90% of the data points fall within the cluster and 10% are outliers). For SI, we used a score of 0.5 for moderate clustering as described by Wu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Wu1">[15]</xref>, and ≥0.75 for strong clustering (note this is close to the value of 0.71 originally reported for strong clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Kaufman1">[16]</xref>). We performed kernel density estimation of the global distribution of gut microbial communities using the R package “ks” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Duong1">[17]</xref>. This included automatic inference of unconstrained (non-diagonal) bandwidth parameters using the function “Hscv”. We also calculated the Caliński-Harabasz (CH) statistic for comparison to PS and SI, using the R ‘fpc’ package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Hennig1">[18]</xref>. This package uses the following formula for the CH statistic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Hennig2">[19]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002863.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002863.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002863.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002863.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002863.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002863.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>In this formula, <italic>n</italic> is the number of data points <italic>w</italic>, <italic>k</italic> is the number of clusters, and <italic>C<sub>h</sub></italic> represents the set of data points in cluster <italic>h</italic>. We chose to use PS and SI to assess the support for clustering (and to choose the number of clusters if supported), as they are both absolute measures of the clustering quality, while CH is only a relative assessment of the quality of the clustering.</p>

        <title>Mapping HMP Diversity onto Community-Generated Diversity</title>
        <p>Beta-diversity measures provide a view of how diversity differs between sets of samples and quantifies those differences. We used the unweighted UniFrac measure of β-diversity to contrast the range of bacterial phylogenetic diversity captured by the HMP data to existing community data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This analysis showed that the overall pattern of diversity is similar for HMP and community data, with clear separation between body sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g001">Figs. 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s001">S1</xref>) as has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-The1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Costello1">[20]</xref>.

        <p>The gut microbiota are the most extensively studied of the human-associated microbiota. Combining community and HMP fecal microbial 16S rRNA gene sequence data effectively extended the subject age range from early infancy to old age (3 days to 85 years old), with the HMP supplying the majority of the middle years of the human life span. Interestingly, infant samples (younger than 2.5 years) were outliers in the range of diversity represented by the healthy adult and elder (older than 70 years) gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) and were more similar to vaginal and skin communities. Adult HMP samples cluster together with those from the community studies, excluding samples from infants (&lt;2.5 yrs) and elders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s031">Table S1</xref>).

        <title>Effect of Clustering Methodology</title>
        <p>We first tested the effects of different cluster scoring methods using a lognormally distributed synthetic community data containing 4 clusters that served as a positive control for enterotypes. We applied the JSD, rJSD and BC distance measures to the synthetic dataset and compared cluster scores using prediction strength (PS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), silhouette index (SI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and Calińksi-Harabasz (CH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) scores. This analysis revealed strong support for 4 clusters using PS for the BC, JSD and rJSD distance metrics, but SI provided no support for clustering using BC and rJSD, and only weak support for 3–5 clusters using the JSD distance metric. The CH index supported 4 clusters using only the JSD distance metric.

        <p>Arumugan <italic>et al.</italic> used CH as the basis for choosing the number of enterotypes, even when SI values were very low (all published values were less than or equal to 0.25), indicating weak or no support for clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Arumugam1">[3]</xref>. It is important to note that the CH score is a relative measure that alone cannot be used to determine statistical significance of clustering in the data, and that furthermore, CH is intended to indicate the optimal number of clusters based on the assumption that clusters exist. PS and SI, on the other hand, are absolute measures of how likely cluster structure is to emerge from a dataset. Based on our results, we recommend using at least one absolute measure (specifically, we recommend PS), and if possible confirming those results with an additional absolute measure (such as SI), when searching for enterotypes. Depending on the signal-to-noise distribution within individual datasets and data types, PS may have difficulty identifying clusters represented by few samples, as we discuss below (<italic>e.g.</italic>, posterior fornix WGS data). In such cases SI may be relied on, but we recommend using a high threshold (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ≥0.75) in identifying potentially reproducible clusters. We prefer PS over SI for large sample sizes because (1) it has a clear quantitative and intuitive interpretation, (2) it allows estimation of the clustering stability of individual samples, and (3) it performs better than SI in recovering known enterotypes in synthetic datasets. Note however that there is currently no consensus in the field on the specific thresholds that should be used with these methods for assessing clustering strength, making it all the more important for researchers to clearly state the criteria they apply when reporting enterotypes.</p>

        <p>These results indicate that the detection of enterotypes is sensitive to the distance metric used, a result also recently reported by Claesson <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Claesson1">[25]</xref>. Note that this sensitivity is not dependent on body site. However, because enterotyping is driven by the relative abundances of specific genera within samples, unweighted UniFrac, which takes into account presence/absence of tree branches but not abundances of sequences mapping to those branches, may not be an ideal distance measure to use for enterotyping. We include it here because it is widely used in microbiome studies. In contrast, the weighted UniFrac, BC, JSD and rJSD distance metrics are based on OTU abundances and should in principle be more appropriate. The lack of concordance between results based on different abundance-based distance metrics raises the following questions: if enterotypes are to be considered robust, must they be observed using more than one distance metric? Or does the lack of concordance between results using different distance metrics indicate that (here at least) weighted UniFrac is the best choice for enterotyping? Because the interpretation of the findings is currently subjective, and in the absence of any community-wide best practices, we recommend using at least 2 or 3 distance metrics and clearly stating the criteria used for calling enterotypes within the context of any particular study. Particularly, if different metrics yield different results, authors should attempt to understand the discrepancies and justify their choice of distance metric.</p>

        <title>Effect of 16S rRNA Variable Region</title>
        <p>To test for the influence of the specific variable region of the 16S rRNA gene on the detection of fecal enterotypes, we compared fecal samples from the HMP for which sequence data for both the V1–V3 and V3–V5 regions were available. Data from the V3–V5 region yielded moderate support for two fecal enterotypes, but no enterotypes were detected using data from the V1–V3 region. When using SI, we observed moderate support for 2 clusters when using JSD on the V1–V3 data and weak support for the V3–V5 data. The highest scores using CH were three clusters using BC for V1–V3 data and two clusters using weighted UniFrac for V3–V5 data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s010">Fig. S10</xref>). Different primers amplifying different regions of the 16S rRNA gene sequence are known to impact the diversity described for a microbial community. For example, primers for the V1–V3 region (<italic>e.g.</italic>, 27F-338R) are not efficient for amplifying 16S rRNA gene sequences from members of the <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> genus, which can dominate the infant microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Koenig1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Kuczynski1">[27]</xref>.

        <title>Effect of OTU-Picking Method</title>
        <p>We compared enterotype clustering using two methods for OTU picking: (1) <italic>de novo</italic> sequence clustering into OTUs, in which sequences are clustered based on similarity to one another, and (2) a reference based approach, in which sequences are clustered based on similarity to sequences in a reference database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Kuczynski1">[27]</xref>. We found that for the HMP dataset, the two OTU picking approaches yielded consistent results for the majority of body sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). However, for the attached keratinized gingiva, posterior fornix and tongue dorsum, the reference-based approach provided moderate support for enterotypes, whereas the <italic>de novo</italic> approach did not support clustering. One important difference between the two OTU-picking approaches is that the reference-based method can yield fewer OTUs, particularly at fine taxonomic resolution, because any sequence that fails to find a match in the database is discarded. In contrast, the <italic>de novo</italic> approach retains all sequences and has the potential to yield higher OTU counts. Fewer OTUs would have the effect of increasing the relative abundances of the dominant genera, and may therefore strengthen the gradient effect frequently observed (see below). Thus, the reference-based OTU picking approach may result in over-confidence in enterotype discovery.</p>

The discrepancy might be due to the fact that the WGS data included too few samples from the smaller “clusters” to permit detection by the prediction strength approach; SI was highest for two enterotypes at the genus level corresponding to <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (either dominant or absent; JSD jackknifed SI: 0.89±0.012), and statistically tied as highest for five (four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species or <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> absent, JSD jackknifed SI: 0.79±0.005) and eight (JSD jackknifed SI: 0.79±0.008) enterotypes at the species level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s017">Fig. S17</xref>).</p>

          <p>Gut enterotypes would be apparent if the underlying data contained sharp divisions in the distribution of samples based on genus-level abundances (<italic>i.e.</italic>, clear regions with no samples between the modes in PCoA plots). We observed a smooth gradient distribution of HMP + community samples based on their <italic>Bacteroides</italic> abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), which in turn was the major determinant of inter-individual β-diversity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Samples at the extremes of this gradient were highly enriched in or depleted of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, but such extremes can be interpretable as outliers on a continuum, rather than statistically significant groups. To further assess the possibility that this gradient was bi- or multi-modal, we mapped the density of samples along the first two dimensions of weighted UniFrac PCoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The kernel density estimates for samples mapped on principal coordinates 1 and 2 show two peaks emerging from the community data (but not from HMP data), which contributed to a second, low peak in the combined data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The HMP samples tended to have higher <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-abundance when compared to the community samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

          <p>The vast majority of samples occupies the intermediate region between low- and high-<italic>Bacteroides</italic> individuals and forms a smooth distribution of gut community configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002863-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Similar gradients of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> abundance across samples have been observed in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Arumugam1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Wu1">[15]</xref>. The factors that drive the bimodal distribution of samples at ends of the gradient remain to be determined. Distinctive boundaries of gut enterotypes in small populations are likely to be blurred with the addition of samples containing intermediate levels of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, although in some cases they may reflect host and environmental influences.</p>
          <p>The extent to which a subject's microbiota varies along the gradient with time is not yet understood. Although many studies to date suggest relative stability of microbial communities over time within adult subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Costello1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Caporaso2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Ley1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Turnbaugh1">[31]</xref>, the relative abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> has been shown to vary over time within individuals, for instance, changes in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> abundances were reported over the course of a year-long weight loss study in obese individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Ley1">[30]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Recent work has also revealed an important role for nutrient status in determining the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>. Fasting (in mice), and feeding (in pythons) can alter the relative abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> quite rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Costello2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Crawford1">[33]</xref>. In humans, excess energy intake above that needed for weight maintenance has been shown to reduce <italic>Bacteroides</italic> levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Jumpertz1">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, long-term dietary habits have been linked to enterotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Wu1">[15]</xref>.</p>
          <p>The low <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-abundance samples within the HMP + community dataset included a rare subset (total of 6 adult samples and 7 infant/child samples) with a high abundance (≥0.6) of <italic>Prevotella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002863.s018">Fig. S18</xref>), which was notable due to generally low abundance of this genus in most other samples (90.1% of adults had &lt;10% <italic>Prevotella</italic>, 64.8% had none in V3–V5 region data rarefied at 1,000 sequences/sample). Samples with high <italic>Prevotella</italic> abundances have previously been observed in non-Western human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-DeFilippo1">[6]</xref>. This community pattern has also been suggested to associate with high-carbohydrate diets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002863-Wu1">[15]</xref>. It is likely that the size of this <italic>Prevotella</italic> peak will increase with the addition of more data from diverse populations, especially given the fact that 7 of the 13 <italic>Prevotella</italic>-rich samples noted above came from non-western subjects. This <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominant community, belonging to a distinct group of samples, was the most enterotype-like cluster we observed in the fecal samples.</p>

        <p>Our results underscore the importance of methodology in assessing whether populations can be categorized by enterotypes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002863-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the factors that might have an effect on enterotyping: the two with the largest effect are the distance metric and the clustering score method. We recommend using at least one absolute scoring method (<italic>i.e.</italic>, PS or SI) combined with at least 2–3 distance metrics to verify the presence of enterotypes. When using the different scoring methods, authors should indicate and justify the choice of thresholds for indicating levels of support for enterotypes. Other factors that should be kept in mind are the data type (and if using 16S rRNA gene sequence data, the variable region sequenced) and the OTU picking method. At the present time, there is no community consensus on how to define an enterotype, and two researchers with the same data can easily come to opposite conclusions regarding the presence of enterotypes if they apply different criteria. Microbial ecologists and clinicians interested in the enterotype concept need to standardize enterotyping methods for the concept to gain utility.</p>

        <p>The large size of the HMP dataset, augmented with the community and MetaHIT data, brought to light the extent of bacterial abundance gradients within body habitats. The presence of these gradients underscores that discrete enterotypes (<italic>i.e.</italic>, enterotypes with distinct boundaries) are lacking. Instead, for continuous OTU and genus gradients are the norm for most body sites, although a few body sites had multimodal distributions of samples with modes near the extremes of the gradients, and very few cases (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the vagina) had consistent discrete community types. The biological drivers of these patterns, and their robustness over time, may be manifestations of host-microbial interactions, especially if they correlate with host factors such as diet, lifestyle, or genetics.</p>
