<p>Two different strategies for stabilizing proteins are (i) positive design in which the native state is stabilized and (ii) negative design in which competing non-native conformations are destabilized. Here, the circumstances under which one strategy might be favored over the other are explored in the case of lattice models of proteins and then generalized and discussed with regard to real proteins. The balance between positive and negative design of proteins is found to be determined by their average “contact-frequency”, a property that corresponds to the fraction of states in the conformational ensemble of the sequence in which a pair of residues is in contact. Lattice model proteins with a high average contact-frequency are found to use negative design more than model proteins with a low average contact-frequency. A mathematical derivation of this result indicates that it is general and likely to hold also for real proteins. Comparison of the results of correlated mutation analysis for real proteins with typical contact-frequencies to those of proteins likely to have high contact-frequencies (such as disordered proteins and proteins that are dependent on chaperonins for their folding) indicates that the latter tend to have stronger interactions between residues that are not in contact in their native conformation. Hence, our work indicates that negative design is employed when insufficient stabilization is achieved via positive design owing to high contact-frequencies.</p>

<p>Most proteins are functional only in their native states. The stability of the native state of proteins is, therefore, of paramount importance both <italic>in vivo</italic> and for many biotechnological applications <italic>in vitro</italic>. Protein stability is determined by the difference between the free energies of the native and non-native states. It follows that protein stabilization can be achieved via two different strategies: (i) ‘positive design’ by introducing favorable interactions between residues in contact in the native state; and (ii) ‘negative design’ by introducing unfavorable interactions between residues in contact in the non-native states. Here, we ask when is one strategy favored over the other. We show that ‘positive design’ is favored when interactions that stabilize the native state are rarely found in the non-native states whereas ‘negative design’ is favored when the interactions that stabilize the native state are also common in the non-native states. We also show that correlated mutations, i.e. mutations at one site that compensate for effects of mutations at other sites, tend to be associated with ‘negative design’. Analysis of protein sequence data shows that a higher incidence of correlated mutations is found in protein families with native states that are not stable or difficult to reach.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein stabilization can be achieved via two different strategies: (i) ‘positive design’ in which the native state is stabilized; and (ii) ‘negative design’ in which non-native states are destabilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Hecht1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Berezovsky1">[3]</xref>. Positive design can be achieved by introducing favorable pairwise interactions between residues that are in contact in the native state whereas negative design can be achieved by introducing unfavorable pairwise interactions between residues that are in contact in non-native conformations of the protein. The factors that favor employing one strategy over the other (or some combination of both strategies) are not known. For example, it is possible that certain features of a protein's native structure such as its secondary structure content or contact-order <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Plaxco1">[4]</xref> bias the choice of which particular strategy is employed. Here, we explore this question with respect to lattice models of proteins and then show that the principles that we have discovered also apply to real proteins. Although lattice models of proteins ignore many important details, they have been used successfully for elucidating general principles of protein folding and stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Dill1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Unger1">[8]</xref> and addressing evolutionary questions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Chan1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Zeldovich1">[11]</xref>. In particular, such models have the advantage that in certain cases all the possible conformations in the ensemble can be enumerated and, therefore, preferential design strategies for certain protein conformations may be identified.</p>
<p>The stability, dynamics and function of proteins are determined by both short- and long-range pairwise interactions. Long-range interactions are manifested, for example, in the energetic coupling between distant ligand-binding sites in allosteric proteins owing to conformational changes that are propagated from one site to another. The strength of both direct (short-range) and indirect (long-range) pairwise interactions can be analysed experimentally using the double-mutant cycle (DMC) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Horovitz1">[12]</xref>. Recently, we introduced a computational version of DMCs for analysis of pairwise interactions in lattice models of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref>. Computational DMC analysis can be easily employed in an exhaustive manner to determine the strength of interaction between all possible residue pairs in a lattice model in contrast with experimental DMC analysis that must be restricted to a relatively small number of residue pairs owing to the prohibitive amount of work involved. Using this computational DMC approach, we previously discovered that the strength of both short- (i.e. between residues in contact in the native state) and long-range (i.e. between residues not in contact in the native state) pairwise interactions changes in a linear fashion with increasing ‘contact-frequency’, a term defined for each pair of residues in a sequence that corresponds to the fraction of states in the conformational ensemble of the sequence in which that pair of residues are in contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Chan2">[14]</xref>. In other words, a pair of residues that are in contact in many conformations available to the chain has a high contact-frequency whereas a pair of residues that are rarely in contact has a low contact-frequency. A protein fold can, therefore, be characterized by the average contact frequency of all the residue pairs in contact in that fold. Here, we show for lattice models that positive design is favored when this average ‘contact frequency’ is low whereas negative design is favored when this average ‘contact frequency’ is high. A mathematical derivation of this result indicates that it is general and, thus, likely to hold also for real proteins.</p>
<p>Negative design in the lattice models is also found to be associated with a higher incidence, on average, of correlated mutations, i.e. mutations at one site that tend to be accompanied by other mutations at a second site. Correlated mutations are assumed to be due to selective pressure to maintain protein structure or function and have, therefore, been used for prediction of 3D protein structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Gbel1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Neher1">[16]</xref>, allosteric pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Lockless1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Kass1">[18]</xref> and protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Pazos1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Weigt1">[20]</xref> and in protein design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Socolich1">[21]</xref>. Correlated mutations in real proteins, however, also reflect common ancestry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Wollenberg1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Noivirt1">[24]</xref> whereas in our lattice models this concern is obviated. Here, by applying correlated mutation analysis we show that proteins likely to have a higher average ‘contact-frequency’, such as disordered proteins, also have a higher incidence of correlated mutations. These results strengthen our conclusion that ‘contact-frequency’ is an important factor in determining the design strategy of real proteins.</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows. First, we show that the effects on stability of positive and negative design in lattice models are both linearly dependent, but with opposite sign, on the contact-frequency and that there is a strong trade-off between them. We then provide a general (not lattice specific) mathematical derivation supporting these claims. An analysis of correlated mutations in sequences selected for stability of a lattice fold that follows next shows that the density of correlated mutations increases with increasing contact-frequency. Finally, we show that a similar trend is likely to exist in real proteins by analyzing correlated mutations in proteins that fold with difficulty and are suspected to have higher contact-frequencies.</p>

<title>Selection in lattice models</title>
<p>Sets of 25 residue-long sequences that share a particular native state were generated with and without selection for native state stability. The native states of the sets that were formed (termed SBSS) correspond to each of the 1081 compact folds on a 5×5 lattice. The average perturbation energy (ΔΔG<sub>per</sub>) was then calculated for each pair of positions i and j in an alignment and the difference, D<sup>(i,j)</sup>, in the average perturbation energies for that pair of positions in the alignments with and without selection was determined. The average value of D<sup>(i,j)</sup> was then calculated for all pairs of positions in contact in a particular native conformation, &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>short</sub>, and for all pairs that form long-range interactions in that conformation, &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>long</sub>. Two positions are defined as forming a long-range interaction in a particular conformation if there is no path formed by residues in contact in that conformation that connects them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000592.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For example, if residue A is in contact with residue B and residue B is in contact with residue C then we do not consider residues A and C to be involved in a long-range interaction. Hence, the number of long-range interactions varies slightly between folds since the paths that connect residues in contact depend on the specific conformation. In the case of a compact conformation on a 5×5 lattice, the number of long-range interactions is 108<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>3 whereas the number of pairs in contact is always 16. It is important to note that all pairs of positions with a contact-frequency of zero (in the case of a square lattice, for example, residues at positions with the same parity cannot be in contact) are not considered in this analysis since their ΔΔG<sub>per</sub> equals zero by definition. The values of &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>short</sub> of different folds were found to be correlated with their respective average contact-frequencies (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g001">Figure 1</xref> that the value of &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>short</sub> decreases when the corresponding value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for that fold increases (r = −0.608; <italic>P</italic>-value&lt;0.0001). Smaller values of &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>short</sub> reflect a smaller contribution of pairs in contact to the gain in stability upon selection. Surprisingly, we discovered that some native states have zero or even negative &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>short</sub> values. Such values are found when the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large. This observation indicates that positive design is almost a negligible factor when stabilizing native states with a very high average contact-frequency.</p>

<title>General derivation of the relationships between the contributions of positive and negative design of protein stability and contact-frequency</title>
<p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g003">3</xref> for a specific lattice model prompted us to examine whether a general derivation can be obtained for the linear dependence of the contributions of positive and negative design to protein stability on contact-frequency. The starting point for the following such derivation is the previously derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref> linear relationship between the perturbation energy and Boltzmann-weighted contact-frequency:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e008" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where E<sub>c</sub> is the energy of a contact that was removed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000592-t001">Table 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Z is the ensemble of all possible conformations and E(C) is the energy of a conformation), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (E(N) is the energy of the native state), λ is the contact energy of the residue types found at positions i and j (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000592-t001">Table 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref>), <italic>T</italic> is the temperature and <italic>k</italic> is the Boltzmann constant. The Boltzmann-weighted contact-frequency, BWCF(i, j), is calculated by multiplying each occurrence of a contact by the Boltzmann weight of the conformation in which it occurs. Eq. (1) can be written in a simplified and approximate form, as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e011" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the contact-frequency that is not Boltzmann-weighted. Given an alignment of sequences with the same native fold, one may express the average perturbation energy for a pair of positions i and j in the alignment, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e015" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>The difference, D<sup>(i,j)</sup>, in the average perturbation energies with and without selection was determined for every relevant pair of positions in the alignments. Inspection of Eq.

The average of D<sup>(i,j)</sup> over all the pairs of positions i and j that form direct short-range native-state contacts, &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>short</sub>, can therefore be written using Eq. (3), as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e017" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average contact-frequency of the short-range native-state contacts, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average of Δ&lt;E<sub>c</sub>&gt; over all the pairs of positions i and j that form direct short-range native-state contacts and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is assumed to be the same for all these pairs. Eq. (5) describes a linear relationship with a negative slope between &lt;D<sup>(i,j)</sup>&gt;<sub>short</sub>, which is a measure of the impact of positive design on stability, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g001">Figure 1</xref> for the lattice model. An expression similar to Eq.

(5) except that E<sub>c</sub> = 0 as it is for the case of long-range interactions.

<title>Analysis of correlated mutations in lattice models</title>
<p>The different SBSS corresponding to the 1081 different 5×5 lattice folds were subjected to correlated mutation analysis in order to determine whether there is a connection between this phenomenon and the stabilization strategy. The correlated mutation analysis was able to identify all the 16 pairs of positions that are in contact in all the 1081 different folds except for some rare cases in which one or two contacts were not detected. In the case of the long-range interactions, the strength of the correlated mutations signal for a given fold was found to depend on the average contact frequency of its contacts. The different folds were divided into three equal-sized classes corresponding to different ranges of values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the distributions of densities of correlated mutations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) at positions involved in long-range interactions were plotted for each class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Although the distributions are overlapping, a clear trend is observed that the average density of long-range correlated mutations increases with increasing<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Analysis of correlated mutations in real proteins</title>
<p>The apparent connection between employing negative design and prevalence of correlated mutations at positions involved in long-range interactions enables us to expand our analysis to real protein data. Given that the calculation of the contact-frequency parameter for a large number of real proteins is impractical owing to the huge size of their conformational spaces, we decided to look into groups of proteins for which there is good reason to assume that their average contact-frequency is high. We analysed two sets of proteins that are likely to have a high average contact-frequency of their contacts. The first set contains intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUP) that populate many conformations and are, therefore, likely to have relatively high values of contact-frequency since individual contacts probably stabilize many different conformations. The second set is based on the GroEL-interacting proteins found by Hartl and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Kerner1">[25]</xref>. These proteins were divided into classes I to III with increased dependency on the GroE chaperonin system for folding correctly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Kerner1">[25]</xref>. A possible reason that these proteins have low folding propensities is their relatively high contact-frequency. In addition, we generated a third set of proteins as a control (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) for the other sets. Given that structural information is not available for disordered regions of proteins and, also, for many of the other sequences, we could not distinguish here between correlated mutations at positions involved in short-range contacts and those involved in long-range interactions. However, this does not affect our conclusions as the fraction of correlated mutations at positions in contact is lower than 20% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Noivirt1">[24]</xref> and is likely to be approximately equal in all the sets. Hence, the variation in the densities stems mostly from the long-range correlations.</p>
<p>The distributions of correlated mutation densities calculated using the tree-based method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Noivirt1">[24]</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g005">Figure 5</xref> for the sequence alignments based on the set of disordered proteins, the three classes of GroEL-dependent proteins and the set of other randomly chosen control proteins (equal in number to that of the IUP-based set). The averages and standard deviations of all the sets are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000592-t001">Table 1</xref>. It can be seen that the average density of correlated mutations is lowest in the case of the control set of proteins, it is higher in the case of the three classes of GroEL-dependent substrates (and increases from class I to III) and is highest for the IUP-based set. This trend is observed only when comparing the average correlated mutation densities of the sets but it is important to note that correlated mutation analysis of real proteins is much noisier than that of lattice model proteins due to the larger alphabet size, errors in sequence alignment and evolutionary background and, therefore, these observations are significant. It should also be noted that fewer correlations were obtained in the case of real proteins as compared with lattice models as the former were detected using the tree-based method that was developed to filter out evolutionary noise and is more stringent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A key observation in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g003">Figure 3</xref>) is that the balance between the contributions of positive and negative design to the stability of different lattice folds varies despite the fact that all the sequences were subjected to the same selection pressure. It is important to note that mutations that affect short-range interactions tend to have much larger effects on stability than those that affect long-range interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref>, suggesting that positive design should be much more common than negative design. However, we find that some folds underwent stabilization by using only negative design. This unexpected result indicates that positive design has limited ability to stabilize certain folds and that negative design compensates for that in cases of such folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000592-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Our results show that folds that can be stabilized by both positive and negative design are distinguished from those that are stabilized mostly by negative design in their average contact-frequency. Folds with low contact-frequency can be stabilized by both positive and negative design whereas those with high contact-frequency can be stabilized mostly by negative design. These results suggest that contact-frequency determines the stabilization potential of different folds and that certain folds are, therefore, more likely to emerge under difficult folding conditions such as extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>The analysis in this paper is based on the premise that stabilization of short-range contacts reflects positive design whereas stabilization of long-range interactions reflects negative design. In lattice models, this assumption is correct since the energy of any native state is determined only by its contacts and, therefore, any stabilization due to long-range interactions must stem from destabilization of non-native states (i.e. negative design). In the case of real proteins, however, this assumption is not necessarily correct since long-range (e.g. electrostatic) interactions can also stabilize the native state. However, the correlated mutation results that we obtained for both the lattice models and real proteins showed the same trend and, therefore, we assume that the correlated mutations that are mostly between distant positions reflect negative design.</p>
<p>It is interesting that two different mechanisms for thermostabilization have also been revealed by comparing mesophilic proteins with their thermophilic homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Berezovsky2">[26]</xref>. One mechanism termed “structure-based” is reflected in structure compactness and appears in proteins that originated in extreme environments. The second mechanism termed “sequence-based” is reflected in a bias of the amino acid composition toward more charged residues and is found in proteins that originated as mesophiles but later had to adapt to higher temperatures. Hence, both the findings here and the work of Berezovsky <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Berezovsky2">[26]</xref> indicate that certain structural (e.g. topological) features of proteins dictate their stabilization potential and that tinkering with sequence can compensate for the lack of such structural features. Thermostability has been attributed previously to amino acid composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Puigb1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Zeldovich2">[29]</xref> but by having all the lattice model sequences in our work share the same composition we were able to identify a purely structural basis for stabilization.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this study we subjected lattice model proteins to selection for stability and showed that the balance between positive and negative design strategies differs for each fold and depends on the average ‘contact-frequency’ of that fold. The use of negative design is found to increase with increasing values of the average ‘contact-frequency’ of the respective fold. Our results, therefore, indicate that each fold has its own stabilization potential that limits its ability to adapt to extreme conditions. We also showed that negative design in lattice models can be identified by correlated mutation analysis and is reflected in higher values of correlated mutation densities. This trend was also found in correlated mutation analysis of real proteins when comparing intrinsically unfolded proteins and chaperonin-dependent protein substrates to other control proteins. Thus, we conclude that stabilization of real proteins with high values of average contact-frequency tends to rely more on negative design and is reflected in higher densities of correlated mutations.</p>

<title>The lattice model of proteins</title>
<p>A 2D lattice model similar to the one described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref> was used. Here, we describe the main features of the model relevant to the current work. The protein sequence consists of an alphabet of four amino acids: hydrophobic (H), neutral polar (P), positively charged (+) and negatively charged (−). All the sequences that were generated have 25 residues and the same composition of 40% H, 28% P, 16% (+) and 16% (−) that corresponds roughly to that of soluble proteins in the PDB. The energy of a sequence in a specific lattice conformation, E(C), was calculated by summing all the pairwise contact energies, e<sub>ij</sub>, between neighboring lattice points (excluding consecutive residues in the sequence which are always neighbors), as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e035" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the distance in lattice units between residues i and j that are separated in sequence by at least two residues and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The pairwise interaction energies (e<sub>ij</sub>) are as before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref> and reflect in a qualitative manner the strengths of interactions between different types of amino acids.</p>
<p>The free energy of folding, ΔG, of the native conformation of a sequence was calculated using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Dill1">[5]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e038" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>where P<sub>N</sub> is the probability that the chain is in its native state N.

A value of 1 was used for <italic>k</italic>T. The energies of all possible 1081 non-symmetric conformations of a given 25 residue-long sequence that fit a 5×5 lattice were calculated and the conformation with the lowest energy, if a single such one exists, was considered as its native conformation.</p>

<title>Generation of structure-based sequence sets (SBSS)</title>
<p>Sets of sequences that have the same native conformation were generated. Two kinds of sets were generated for each of the 1081 lattice conformations. In the first set, the only requirement was that all the sequences comprising the set have the same particular native conformation. In the second set, we required that the free energy of folding to the native state of the selected sequences is lower than some threshold value. Sets of the first type can be generated easily by classifying random sequences to different SBSS according to their native conformation. Sets of the second type could not be generated rapidly using this simple procedure and, therefore, we used a Monte Carlo (MC) maximization process of the following function:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e041" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>where N<sub>c</sub> and N<sub>non</sub> are the total number of contacts and non-contacts in the specific conformation, respectively. In each step of the MC process, two residues in the sequence were randomly swapped and the swap was accepted if the Metropolis criterion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Metropolis1">[30]</xref> was met. The MC process was stopped when a sequence with the requested native state and with ΔG&lt;ΔG<sub>threshold</sub> was found. We will refer to the SBSS that were generated by procedures (i) and (ii) as the sets without and with selection, respectively. Each set contained between 50–64 sequences. The average ΔG of folding for all the sequences in the sets without selection is approximately 2.6±0.6 and, therefore, the threshold, ΔG<sub>threshold</sub>, for selecting sequences with stable native folds was set to zero.</p>

<title>Calculation of perturbation energies</title>
<p>We calculated a perturbation energy, ΔΔG<sub>per</sub> = ΔG<sub>wt</sub>−ΔG<sub>m</sub>, for every possible pair of positions in each sequence where ΔG<sub>wt</sub> and ΔG<sub>m</sub> are the respective free energies of folding of the wild-type sequence before and after a particular short- or long-range pairwise interaction is ‘turned off’ but without affecting any other interaction. Under ideal circumstances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-Serrano1">[31]</xref>, the pairwise interaction energy (or coupling energy) determined experimentally using DMC provides a good estimate of the perturbation energy that can only be determined by computation. In the case of lattice models, the values of the computationally derived pairwise coupling energies from DMC are essentially identical to those of the corresponding perturbation energies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000592-NoivirtBrik1">[13]</xref>, thus justifying the use of perturbation energies to estimate the strength of pairwise interactions. The ΔΔG<sub>per</sub> for each pair of positions i and j was determined for each sequence in a SBSS and the average value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000592.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for that pair of positions in all the sequences in the SBSS was calculated.

The correlated mutation density is defined as the number of pairs of positions that were found to have a significant correlation divided by the total number of possible pairs of positions. Note that conserved positions or positions at which more than 10% of the sequences in the alignment have a gap (this is relevant only to real proteins) were not considered in the analysis. In addition, the correlated mutation densities of the intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUP)-based alignments were calculated using only the disordered positions.</p>

<p>Scheme of a lattice model showing examples for (i) short-range interactions between residues in contact and (ii) long-range interactions between residues that are not in contact either directly or indirectly. Examples for pairs of residues involved in short-range interactions (e.g. 17 and 24) are indicated by the red line that connects the two residues in contact. Residues 8 and 24, for example, are in indirect contact since there is a path formed by residues in contact that connects them (8-19-14-17-24). By contrast, residues 2 and 13, for example, that are connected by the dashed arrow are defined as being involved in a long-range interaction since there is no path formed by residues in contact that connects them.</p>
