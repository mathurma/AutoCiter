      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Building models of a biological system that are consistent with the myriad data available is one of the key challenges in biology. Modeling the structure and dynamics of macromolecular assemblies, for example, can give insights into how biological systems work, evolved, might be controlled, and even designed. Modeling can also suggest future experiments. Unfortunately, current publishing norms make it hard to build on published models, because such models are often not available in usable form and because it is hard to publish refinements of others' models. Here, we present steps towards a future in which a scientist can read a paper, download a script, add new data, and see how the new data improve the published model. Integrative structure modeling casts the building of structural models as a computational optimization problem, for which information about the assembly is encoded into a scoring function that evaluates candidate models. We describe our software suite, Integrated Modeling Platform, and invite members of the scientific community to use it, improve on it, and apply it to their own scientific problems of interest.</p>
      <p>Numerous structures have to date been solved by using an integrative structural modeling approach. The structure of the 26S proteasome was determined from an electron microscopy (EM) map of the whole assembly, proteomics data about its subunit composition, and comparative protein structure models of the component proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Lasker1">[1]</xref>. The structure of the bacterial type II pilus was assembled from sparse nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and X-ray crystallographic structures of constituent proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Simon1">[2]</xref>. The structure of chromatin around the alpha-globin gene was assembled from so-called 5C data (chromosome conformation capture carbon copy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Ba1">[3]</xref>. The value of integrative modeling is illustrated by its application to the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Alber1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Alber2">[5]</xref>. The sheer size and flexibility of the NPC makes it all but impossible to solve its molecular architecture by conventional atomic resolution techniques, such as X-ray crystallography. However, integrating information from multiple sources, including stoichiometry from protein quantification, protein proximities from subcomplex purification, protein positions from immuno-EM, sedimentation analysis that sheds light on protein and subcomplex shapes, and the overall NPC shape from EM, resulted in an ensemble of medium-resolution models. The models were summarized by a 3-D probability map, resembling an EM map and localizing the 456 constituent proteins with an average precision of approximately 5 nm. This map has revealed fundamental new insights into the function of the NPC as a gatekeeper controlling the entry into and exit from the nucleus of macromolecules, and also shed light on its evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Alber1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Wente1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-DeGrasse1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Integrative modeling entails a computational encoding of the standard scientific cycle of gathering data, proposing hypotheses, and then gathering more data to test and refine those hypotheses. It proceeds through repeated iterations of the stages of gathering information, choosing how to represent and evaluate models, finding models that score well, and analyzing the models and information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001244-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1001244-box001">Box 1</xref>). The cycle terminates when a convergent ensemble of models is found fitting the current information and the models have been judged to be satisfactory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Alber3">[9]</xref>. When new information is gathered, whether by other scientists or other techniques, the cycle is resumed.</p>

            <title>Stage 1: Gathering Information</title>
            <p>Information is collected in the form of data from wet lab experiments, as well as statistical tendencies such as atomic statistical potentials, physical laws such as molecular mechanics force fields, and any other feature that can be converted into a score for use to assess features of a structural model.</p>

            <p>The resolution of the representation depends on the quantity and resolution of the available information and should be commensurate with the resolution of the final models: different parts of a model may be represented at different resolutions, and one part of the model may be represented at several different resolutions simultaneously. The scoring function evaluates whether or not a given model is consistent with the input information, taking into account the uncertainty in the information.</p>

            <title>Stage 3: Finding Models That Score Well</title>
            <p>The search for models that score well is performed using any of a variety of sampling and optimization schemes (such as the Monte Carlo method). There may be many models that score well if the data are incomplete or none if the data are inconsistent due to errors or unconsidered states of the assembly.</p>

            <title>Stage 4: Analyzing Resulting Models and Information</title>
            <p>The ensemble of good-scoring models needs to be clustered and analyzed to ascertain their precision and accuracy, and to check for inconsistent information. Analysis can also suggest what are likely to be the most informative experiments to perform in the next iteration.</p>
            <p>Integrative modeling iterates through these stages until a satisfactory model is built. Many iterations of the cycle may be required, given the need to gather more data as well as to resolve errors and inconsistent data.</p>

The data were found to be insufficient to uniquely resolve the structure. To overcome this challenge, protein interaction networks extracted from BioGrid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Stark1">[48]</xref> were added.

      <p>The integrative approach has a number of advantages over informal or partial consideration of available information (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1001244-box002">Box 2</xref>). Fully realizing these advantages requires encoding modeling efforts into integrative modeling applications that consist of the scripts and the associated information. Adoption of integrative modeling can occur through a tight collaboration between a computational lab and an experimental lab, through direct adoption by an experimental lab, or by experimentalists modifying existing integrative modeling applications. To facilitate widespread adoption, we have developed the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software package.</p>

            <title>Understanding and Assessing the Models</title>

A full sampling of the models of a structure can improve the understanding of its function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Ma1">[49]</xref>. Because the data are encoded in scoring functions and the full set of models can be found, integrative modeling facilitates assessing the input information and output models in terms of precision and accuracy.</p>

      <title>A Platform for Integrative Modeling</title>
      <p>The IMP software package facilitates the writing of integrative modeling applications; the development of new model representations, scoring functions, sampling schemes, and analysis methods; and the distribution of integrative modeling applications.</p>
      <p>In IMP, models are encoded as collections of particles, each representing a piece of the system. Depending on the data available, particles can be used to create atomic, coarse-grained, or hierarchical representations. It is straightforward to represent a protein at any resolution, from fully flexible atomic models (one particle per atom), to rigid bodies, to coarse-grained models consisting of only one or a few particles for the whole protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001244-g001">Figure 1</xref> for a worked-through example, structural modeling of the human RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Lasker2">[10]</xref>). Different parts of the model can be represented differently, as dictated by the available information. Each particle has associated attributes, such as coordinates, radius, atom type, rigid body composition, residue information, and mass. If the attributes already in IMP are not sufficient, new attributes can be created and used similarly to the predefined ones. For example, for coarse-grained small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) scoring, a scattering factor attribute could be associated with the particles representing amino acid residues.</p>
      <p>Candidate models are evaluated by a scoring function composed of terms called restraints, each of which measures how well a model agrees with the information from which the restraint was derived. The restraints encode both what is known about structures in general and what is known about this particular structure. Thus, a candidate model that scores well is consistent with all used information. The precision and accuracy of the resulting model increases with the amount and quality of information that is encoded in the restraints. IMP's ever-growing set of scoring function types includes ones for SAXS profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-SchneidmanDuhovny1">[11]</xref>, proteomics data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Alber3">[9]</xref>, EM images and density maps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Lasker2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Lasker3">[12]</xref>, NMR spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Simon1">[2]</xref>, the CHARMM force-field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Brooks1">[13]</xref>, alignment with related structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Sali1">[14]</xref>, and a variety of statistical potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Shen1">[15]</xref>. IMP has been designed to make it easy for others to develop, use, and distribute new restraints. Other research groups are currently implementing restraints for various mass spectrometry measurements, SAXS, 5C data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Ba1">[3]</xref>, and atomic structure prediction.</p>
      <p>For experimental data, the scoring is generally implemented using a “forward model” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Rieping1">[16]</xref>, which simulates the measurements on the basis of the candidate model and then compares the simulated measurements to the actual measurements. For example, to evaluate the fit to an EM density map, a restraint uses the coordinates, radii, and masses of a set of particles representing the assembly to simulate its density map and then evaluates the cross-correlation with the experimental map.</p>
      <p>As with most computational structure efforts, the main demand for computational time in integrative modeling comes from sampling models that satisfy the restraints (good-scoring models). IMP provides a wide variety of tools for building these sampling protocols, including optimization algorithms such as Monte Carlo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Metropolis1">[17]</xref> and conjugate gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Press1">[18]</xref>, the simplex optimizer from Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Gough1">[19]</xref>, simulation schemes such as molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Schlick1">[20]</xref>, and the Bullet rigid body dynamics engine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bulletphysics.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bulletphysics.com</ext-link>), as well as full sampling schemes such as the Gibbs sampler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Rieping1">[16]</xref>, replica exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Zhou1">[21]</xref>, and a divide-and-conquer sampler called DOMINO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Lasker4">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, IMP provides a variety of tools for comparing, clustering, and analyzing models. These tools can be used to check for quality-of-fit, the existence of multiple states of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Ba1">[3]</xref>, and inconsistent information. Models can be clustered on the basis of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), placement score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-SchneidmanDuhovny1">[11]</xref>, and various other metrics. Supported clustering algorithms include k-means, centrality betweenness clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Freeman1">[23]</xref>, and simple binning. The resulting clusters and the constituent models as well as restraints can be exported to Chimera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Yang1">[24]</xref> and Pymol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-DeLano1">[25]</xref> for visual inspection and further analysis.</p>
      <p>IMP has been used to produce a number of models; for example, a eukaryotic ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Taylor1">[26]</xref>, a mammalian ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Chandramouli1">[27]</xref>, a ryanodine receptor channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Serysheva1">[28]</xref>, the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Lasker1">[1]</xref>, the Hsp90 chaperonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Krukenberg1">[29]</xref>, the TRiC/CCT chaperonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Booth1">[30]</xref>, the actin-scruin complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Cong1">[31]</xref>, chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Ba1">[3]</xref>, and the NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Alber1">[4]</xref>. More information about IMP can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://integrativemodeling.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://integrativemodeling.org/</ext-link>. The website provides a technical introduction, a tutorial, as well as a variety of examples to help users get started.

      <title>Towards Open Structure Modeling</title>
      <p>Publication of macromolecular structures has evolved from printed words and pictures to include deposition of coordinates in the Protein Data Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Berman1">[32]</xref>, and more recently deposition of raw input data such as X-ray scattering factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Berman1">[32]</xref>, NMR restraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Ulrich1">[33]</xref>, and EM particle images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Lawson1">[34]</xref>. However, the conversion of the raw data to the final structures is often only briefly described and all too rarely available in a directly usable form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Mesirov1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Merali1">[37]</xref>, making reproduction and use of the published results laborious or even impossible.</p>
      <p>If published papers included integrative modeling applications, a wide variety of researchers would benefit. In particular, experimental labs, which are unlikely otherwise to go through the effort of modeling systems themselves, would be able to use the state-of-the-art model to plan experiments by simulating potential benefits gained from new data. It would also be easy to see how much each new measurement contributes to and fits with the current model. Other computational groups could more easily experiment with new scoring, sampling, and analysis methods, without having to reimplement the existing methods from scratch. The common abstraction would make it easier to mix and match parts of other modeling packages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Brooks1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Sali1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Rieping1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-LeaverFay1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001244-Peter1">[46]</xref> to improve the applications of integrative modeling. Finally, the authors themselves would maximize the impact of their work, increasing the odds that their results are incorporated into future modeling.</p>
