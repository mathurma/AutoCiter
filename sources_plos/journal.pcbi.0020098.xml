To address this issue, we report here simulation studies of three model proteins: chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), barnase, and Semliki forest virus protein (SFVP), and directly compare their folding during ribosome-mediated synthesis with their refolding from random, denatured conformations. To calibrate the methodology, simulations are first compared with in vitro data on the folding stabilities of N-terminal fragments of CI2 and barnase; the simulations reproduce the fact that both the stability and thermal folding cooperativity increase as fragments increase in length. Coupled simulations of synthesis and folding for the same two proteins are then described, showing that both fold essentially post-translationally, with mechanisms effectively identical to those for refolding. In both cases, confinement of the nascent polypeptide chain within the ribosome tunnel does not appear to promote significant formation of native structure during synthesis; there are however clear indications that the formation of structure within the nascent chain is sensitive to location within the ribosome tunnel, being subject to both gain and loss as the chain lengthens. Interestingly, simulations in which CI2 is artificially stabilized show a pronounced tendency to become trapped within the tunnel in partially folded conformations: non-cooperative folding, therefore, appears in the simulations to exert a detrimental effect on the rate at which fully folded conformations are formed. Finally, simulations of the two-domain protease module of SFVP, which experimentally folds cotranslationally, indicate that for multi-domain proteins, ribosome-mediated folding may follow different pathways from those taken during refolding. Taken together, these studies provide a first step toward developing more realistic methods for simulating protein folding as it occurs in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>The question of how proteins fold into their three-dimensional native conformations continues to be a subject of considerable interest, in large part because misfolding or aggregation of proteins is associated with a number of important diseases. Most previous research has focused on how proteins refold from denatured conformations in vitro, and much of the experimentally observed behavior has proven to be explicable with molecular simulations performed on computers. Recently attention has begun to move toward understanding protein folding as it occurs in vivo, which development requires, among other things, consideration of potential interactions with chaperonins and non-specific crowding effects due to the high macromolecular concentrations encountered in physiological conditions. Also under increasing consideration experimentally is the possibility that proteins might begin to fold while being synthesized (i.e., cotranslational folding), and the purpose of this work is therefore to develop and apply a first molecular simulation strategy capable of modeling this process. The simulations thus described, while not free of assumptions and approximations, nevertheless provide some intriguing glimpses into how the process of protein folding might be modulated through coupling to synthesis within the large ribosomal subunit.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded with the generous support of the Roy J.

Significant insights into the process of protein refolding in vitro have been obtained through both experimental and theoretical techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b005">5</xref>], and the influence of theoretical work is reflected in the presence of expressions such as “energy landscape” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b006">6</xref>] and “contact order” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b007">7</xref>] in the folding lexicon. In fact, a number of aspects of folding as it occurs in vitro are now quite well understood, even though this understanding has yet to translate into the realm of allowing routine, accurate prediction of protein structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b008">8</xref>].</p><p>Protein folding in vivo is considerably more complicated than folding in vitro for a number of reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b001">1</xref>]. First, a variety of chaperonins play prominent roles in preventing or reversing misfolding and aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b011">11</xref>]. Second, folding of proteins can be coupled directly to their synthesis in a process termed “cotranslational folding” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b015">15</xref>]. Finally, both the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein folding, and the potential for aggregation, may be significantly affected by the highly crowded conditions encountered physiologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b018">18</xref>]. In recognition of some of these issues, a number of theoretical and simulation studies have begun to address the possible effects of chaperonins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b020">20</xref>], confinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b022">22</xref>], and crowding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b025">25</xref>] on the behavior of protein systems. In contrast, far less attention has been paid to the question of how the gradual, ribosome-mediated extension of a nascent protein chain might impact its folding behavior: the only previous simulation studies of which we are aware have considered the coupling of synthesis and folding for lattice-based protein models in the absence of the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b027">27</xref>]; the second of these works provided the intriguing result that cotranslational folding could cause a protein to adopt a metastable conformation different from its native conformation.</p><p>This paper describes the first molecular simulations of the cotranslational folding of proteins progressively synthesized within a structurally detailed model of the ribosomal large subunit. The method borrows a simple Gō-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b028">28</xref>] folding model of a type that has been successfully used to model the refolding kinetics of a large number of proteins (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b032">32</xref>]), and combines it with a new, straightforward computational protocol that models synthesis of a nascent chain by the gradual addition of amino acids at the ribosome's peptidyltransferase active site. Importantly, although the simplified nature of the model means that folding occurs on an artificially short timescale, care is taken to ensure that the simulated rates of folding and synthesis are realistically matched. The simulations allow a direct view of the way that protein folding behavior is likely to be affected by coupling to synthesis within the ribosome, and serve as a first step toward developing models that more faithfully represent protein folding as it occurs in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Stabilities of Fragments of Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 and Barnase</title><p>Although a molecular simulation method can be programmed to model the coupled synthesis and folding of proteins relatively easily, the credibility of simulations performed with the method rests on their ability to reproduce appropriate experimental data. Since translation of proteins occurs starting at the N-terminus, one straightforward test that can be imagined is whether the simulation model successfully captures the folding behavior of N-terminal fragments of different lengths: in this regard, an important body of data is a series of studies conducted by the Fersht group characterizing the behavior of a series of fragments of the model proteins chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b035">35</xref>] and barnase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b037">37</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b038">38</xref>]). For both proteins it has been shown that fragments with C-terminal residues deleted are markedly reduced in stability relative to the full-length protein; our first task, therefore, is to investigate whether the simulation model can reproduce this behavior. This has been done in the following way. First, the single adjustable parameter of the model—the energy well depth (ɛ) assigned to all favorable residue–residue interactions—has been adjusted so that the experimental free energy of folding (ΔG°<sub>fold</sub>) of each full-length protein at 300 K is approximately reproduced. Then, the same optimized energy parameter has been used in simulations of smaller fragments of the same protein in order to <italic>predict</italic> their behavior (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>Throughout this work we assume that the extent of folding in a given protein conformation can be adequately described in terms of the folding (reaction) coordinate “Q,” which is conventionally defined as the fraction of the set of native residue–residue contacts that are present in the conformation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows the computed free energy (G) as a function of Q for full-length CI2 and its fragments at 300 K; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>B shows the same information for fragments of barnase. For full-length CI2 (fragment 1–64), there are two clear minima on the one-dimensional energy landscape described by Q: a global minimum at Q ~ 0.9 that represents the folded state, and a local minimum at Q ~ 0.25 that represents the unfolded state. The free energy difference between the unfolded and folded state basins approximates the experimental folding free energy of −7 kcal/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b039">39</xref>]; the energy parameter that produced these results was ɛ = 0.60 kcal/mol. For CI2 fragments that are close to full length (fragments 1–60, 1–62, and 1–63 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), the computed free energy landscapes also exhibit two minima, but there is a progressive decrease in the free energy difference between folded and unfolded states as the fragments become shorter. For the shortest CI2 fragments studied (1–40 and 1–50), only single, broad minima located at low Q values are obtained, indicating that both fragments are predominantly unfolded at 300 K. The results obtained for barnase are qualitatively similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In this case however, since for the full-length protein (fragment 1–109), a separate local minimum for the unfolded state is not completely resolved on the one-dimensional energy surface at 300 K (though it is at the folding temperature, T<sub>fold</sub>), it is less easy to match the experimental value (ΔG°<sub>fold</sub> = −9 kcal/mol; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b040">40</xref>]) with precision; the final chosen value of ɛ was 0.57 kcal/mol, which is very similar to that chosen for CI2. At no temperature does the one-dimensional free energy surface show the presence of the folding intermediate apparent in a previous Gō-model study of barnase refolding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b029">29</xref>]. Again however, as with CI2, only those fragments that are close to full length (fragments 1–95 and 1–105) retain appreciable stability: there is a progressive loss of stability in the fragments of decreasing length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020098-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Folding Stabilities and Properties of CI2 and Barnase Fragments</title><p>(A) Plot of free energy, G, versus Q at 300 K for six fragments of CI2.</p><p>(B) Same as (A), but showing results for barnase.</p><p>(C) Mean value of Q computed from simulations for CI2 compared with fluorescence intensities taken from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g010">Figure 10</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b034">34</xref>].</p><p>(D) Same as (C), but for barnase, and compared with fluorescence intensities taken from Table 1 of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b036">36</xref>].</p><p>(E) Fractional population of correct secondary structure at all residues in CI2 fragments at 278 K.</p><p>(F) Same as (E), but for barnase.</p><p>(G) Mean values of Q<sub>res</sub> at all residues in CI2 fragments at 278 K.</p><p>(H) Same as (G), but for barnase.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The one-dimensional free energy surfaces for fragments of CI2 and barnase show behavior that is for the most part qualitatively consistent with experiment, but there are more-quantitative comparisons that can be performed (compiled in the remaining panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The most straightforward is to use the computed free energy profiles to calculate the mean value of Q adopted by each fragment at 300 K (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and to compare these calculated values with a corresponding experimental measure of the fragments' conformational state. In the present case, the most convenient such measures are the fluorescence intensities reported by the Fersht group, which for both proteins have been argued to provide a reasonably direct measure of the extent of tertiary structure formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b036">36</xref>]. Comparisons of the computed mean Q values with these experimental fluorescence intensities are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>C for CI2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>D for barnase. The agreement for both proteins is surprisingly good and particularly so in the case of barnase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), even when studies are extended to a C-terminal fragment (residues 23–109; asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>It is possible to conduct more-detailed analyses of the development of structure in the fragments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">1</xref>G show the extent of secondary and tertiary structure formation, respectively, at individual residues in all studied fragments of CI2; note that for these purposes, we define tertiary structure in terms of a <italic>residue-specific</italic> folding reaction coordinate (Q<sub>res</sub>) for each residue (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and note also that both secondary and tertiary structure are computed at 278 K to facilitate comparison with the Fersht group's measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b035">35</xref>]. In terms of the computed secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>E), there is a low level of correct secondary structure formation in fragments 1–40 (unpublished data), 1–50, and 1–53, but this increases significantly between fragments 1–53 (magenta) and 1–60 (yellow). A similar trend is observed with the more tertiary structure–oriented measure Q<sub>res</sub>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>G), indicating that in the simulations, the development of secondary and tertiary structure occurs in concert as the fragments increase in length. A concomitant development of secondary and tertiary structure is also observed experimentally, and an abrupt increase in both secondary structure and tertiary structure is also inferred; however, the experimental transition occurs considerably earlier, between fragments 1–50 and 1–53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b035">35</xref>]. Corresponding results for barnase are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">1</xref>H. Again, secondary and tertiary structure develop largely in concert with each other in the simulations, but there appears to be a significant consolidation of tertiary structure between fragments 1–79 (yellow) and 1–95 (green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>H) that is not as readily apparent in the secondary structure plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). Unfortunately, only limited nuclear magnetic resonance data could be obtained for fragment 1–95 because of aggregation issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b036">36</xref>]; experimentally, therefore, it can only be stated that there is a significant increase in tertiary structure somewhere between fragments 1–79 and 1–105, which is at least not inconsistent with the simulated behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cooperativity of Thermal Unfolding for Fragments of CI2 and Barnase</title><p>Although the above comparisons indicate that the simple C<sub>α</sub>-based simulation model does not produce a perfect description of the folding behavior of fragments, they do indicate that it provides a good qualitative reproduction of the key experimental finding that substantial global structure formation in CI2 and barnase occurs only with fragments that are near to full length. A second important finding of the Fersht group's experimental studies of both CI2 and barnase is that the thermal unfolding of longer fragments is noticeably more cooperative than that of smaller fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b036">36</xref>]. The question of whether this result is also reproduced by the simulation model has been answered by computing folding free energy surfaces over the range of temperatures from 200 K to 400 K; illustrations of some of the computed surfaces are shown for CI2 fragments 1–40, 1–50, 1–60, and 1–64 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g002">Figure 2</xref>. As indicated by the mean value of the folding coordinate Q (open circles), increasing the temperature produces the expected effect of shifting the equilibrium from the folded state (Q ~ 0.9) to the unfolded state (Q ~ 0.2) for all fragments. Crucially, however, the thermal transition from the folded to the unfolded state becomes noticeably more abrupt (i.e., cooperative) as the fragments increase in length; a qualitatively identical result is also obtained with barnase fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The increase in the cooperativity of folding can be more clearly seen in plots of the proteins' heat capacities as a function of temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg002">Figure S2</xref>): for both CI2 and barnase, the peak in the computed heat capacity that occurs at the transition midpoint becomes increasingly sharp as the fragments increase in length.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020098-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Folding Free Energy Surfaces for CI2 Fragments</title><p>(A–D) Free energy surfaces for fragments comprising residues 1–40, 1–50, 1–60, and 1–64 (full length), respectively.

This provides confidence in extending the same basic approach to investigate how the folding behavior of proteins might be affected (or unaffected) by coupling to synthesis within the ribosome. To this end, a simple computational protocol was developed for modeling the progressive growth of a polypeptide chain within a structural model of the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Simulation snapshots taken from a typical coupled synthesis–folding simulation of CI2 conducted with the same energy parameter used above (ɛ = 0.60 kcal/mol) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g003">Figure 3</xref>. As the nascent protein chain lengthens, the N-terminus gradually worms its way out of the ribosomal tunnel, first emerging into the solution environment when it is 35–40 residues long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g003">Figure 3</xref>A); notably however, even after this point, it continues to make occasional returns toward the peptidyltransferase active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), consistent with experimental cross-linking results reported for other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b041">41</xref>].

Plots of the mean folding coordinate Q as a function of the nascent chain length for the simulations are shown for the period during synthesis as filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; consistent with the low stabilities of N-terminal fragments shown earlier, the mean Q exhibited in these simulations is always much lower than the theoretical maximum (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) that would be attained if the nascent chain assumed its native conformation throughout its synthesis. By the end of synthesis, the mean value of Q is only 0.13. This lack of appreciable structure suggests that confinement of the protein within the ribosomal tunnel—at least with the current simulation model—does not significantly promote native structure formation during synthesis. (Tests of the sensitivity of this result to the parameters of the simulation model are considered in a subsequent section.) Since the question of confinement effects on protein stability is of current interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b022">22</xref>], this issue was investigated further by performing an additional 50 coupled synthesis–folding simulations in which the ribosome structure was omitted, but which were otherwise performed in exactly the same way. If confinement within the tunnel promotes structure formation, the folding coordinate Q for the nascent protein during synthesis would be expected to be somewhat higher in the simulations performed in the presence of the ribosome than in those without the ribosome. The mean values of Q in the two sets of simulations are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, from which it is apparent that no such effect is observed. In fact, toward the end of synthesis, significantly higher Q values are observed in the simulations that omit the ribosome (open circles) since the protein is able to begin folding by doubling back onto its tethered C-terminus: for obvious steric reasons, this cannot occur when the protein is synthesized within the ribosome. Again, the same behavior is observed with barnase: confinement within the tunnel does not promote tertiary structure formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020098-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Effect of Confinement on Folding of CI2 and Barnase</title><p>(A) Mean values of Q during coupled synthesis–folding of CI2 in the presence (filled circles) and absence (open circles) of the ribosome.</p><p>(B) Same as (A), but for barnase.</p><p>(C) Mean values of the residue-specific Q<sub>res</sub> value during coupled synthesis–folding of CI2 in the presence of the ribosome; separate lines are plotted for each residue, colored from blue to red.

Although the maximum attainable Q and the mean Q in simulations performed in the absence of the ribosome both increase monotonically as the nascent chain grows (with the former by definition reaching Q = 1 when the chain is completely synthesized), there are periods in the simulations performed in the presence of the ribosome in which the mean value of Q actually <italic>decreases</italic> slightly as the nascent chain grows. A more detailed view of the destabilization of the protein structure associated with these periods can be obtained by plotting the Q<sub>res</sub> values of all individual residues as a function of the nascent chain length (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">5</xref>D for CI2 and barnase, respectively). With both proteins, there are periods (marked by arrows) in which the Q<sub>res</sub> values of several residues drop simultaneously as the chain increases in length; in most cases, the Q<sub>res</sub> values recover again as the chain extends further in length. It is important to note that this decrease is not simply due to natural fluctuations in the amount of structure formation since the plotted values represent mean values averaged over 100-ns periods and over 30 independent trajectories. Supporting this contention is the fact that similar decreases do not occur at all in simulations in which the ribosome structure is omitted: in such cases, once increased, the Q<sub>res</sub> values of all residues never undergo any significant decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). This difference in behavior indicates, therefore, that it is the relative position of the nascent chain within the ribosome tunnel that is responsible for modulating the extent of its structure formation during synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Kinetics of De Novo Folding and Refolding</title><p>For both proteins, the de novo folding behavior observed in the coupled synthesis–folding simulations was compared with that obtained in “refolding” simulations in the absence of the ribosome; refolding simulations were performed in two different ways: (1) starting from randomly generated conformations and (2) starting from denatured conformations (Q ~ 0.2) sampled from simulations performed at the folding temperature, T<sub>fold</sub>, of the proteins (i.e., where ΔG°<sub>fold</sub> ~ 0). Histograms of the folding times obtained from the three types of simulations are shown for CI2 and barnase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g006">6</xref>B, respectively. (Note that for de novo folding, we have chosen to measure time starting from the moment at which the final amino acid is released.) The distributions of folding times are in all cases reasonably well defined, suggesting that a meaningful sample of events has been obtained. There are three main results to note. First, as has already been alluded to, the simulated folding times (~300 ns) are orders of magnitude shorter than the real experimental folding times (~30 ms); this artificial rapidity of folding is an inevitable consequence of the extreme simplicity of the model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). Despite the enormous disparity in absolute folding times, however, the relative refolding times of the two proteins obtained from the simulations are qualitatively correct: for CI2 and barnase, the median simulated refolding times are 280 ns and 395 ns, respectively, whereas the experimental folding times are 20 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b039">39</xref>] and 50 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b042">42</xref>], respectively. This result echoes a finding demonstrated more comprehensively by others, that simple Gō-type simulation models can correctly reproduce the relative folding rates of small proteins (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b031">31</xref>]). Second, for both proteins, the median time for de novo folding is similar to the time taken for refolding from conformations sampled from the denatured ensemble, but is significantly shorter than for refolding from randomly generated conformations: for CI2, the median folding times for de novo folding, refolding from denatured, and refolding from random conformations, are 227 ns, 224 ns, and 280 ns, respectively; for barnase, the median folding times for de novo folding, refolding from denatured, and refolding from random conformations are 242 ns, 303 ns, and 395 ns, respectively. Interestingly, a Westenberg-Mood median test (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/Service/Statistics/Median_Test.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/Service/Statistics/Median_Test.html</ext-link>) indicates that the median folding times for de novo folding and for refolding from denatured conformations are statistically indistinguishable (<italic>p</italic>-values of 0.86 and 0.84 for the H<sub>0</sub> hypothesis—that they are identical—for CI2 and barnase, respectively), but indicates that the median folding times for de novo folding and for refolding from random conformations <italic>are</italic> distinguishable (<italic>p</italic>-values of 0.23 and 0.15 for CI2 and barnase, respectively); the median folding times for refolding from random and denatured conformations are also distinguishable from one another (<italic>p</italic>-values of 0.12 and 0.12 for CI2 and barnase, respectively). These differences in median refolding times indicate (1) that the denatured conformations sampled at the folding temperature are decidedly non-random and (2) that the time required for a randomly constructed conformation to lose its “randomness” in refolding conditions is not negligible compared to the total time required to complete refolding in these simulations. A third and final result to point out is that for CI2, but not for barnase, there is a number of very fast refolding trajectories (folding times &lt;100 ns) that are not observed in the case of de novo folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g006">Figure 6</xref>A); these fast trajectories are obtained regardless of whether the initial conformations for the refolding are randomly constructed or sampled from a denatured state ensemble at T<sub>fold</sub>. The absence of de novo folding times shorter than 100 ns appears to indicate that for CI2, there is a lower time limit for folding imposed by the time required to diffuse out of the ribosome tunnel; support for this interpretation comes from the fact that with the slower folder barnase, there are no refolding trajectories that are significantly faster than de novo trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020098-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Simulated Kinetics of Refolding and De Novo Folding for CI2 and Barnase</title><p>(A) Histograms of folding times obtained from refolding and de novo folding trajectories for CI2.</p><p>(B) Same as (A), but for barnase.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Mechanisms of De Novo Folding and Refolding</title><p>The refolding mechanisms of CI2 and barnase have been the subject not only of very extensive experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b043">43</xref>], but also of a large number of computational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b048">48</xref>], including some that have employed Gō-type simulation models similar to that used here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b049">49</xref>]. Since it is known that the simulated folding behavior obtained with Gō-type models can be surprisingly sensitive to the precise details of the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b049">49</xref>], it is worth verifying that the refolding mechanism obtained from the particular simulation model used here is reasonable by comparing it with experimental data. Probably the most useful experimental means of studying refolding mechanisms is “Φ-value analysis” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b051">51</xref>] in which a residue's role in the transition state for folding is determined by comparing the effect of mutating the residue on the activation free energy for folding with its effect on the overall free energy of folding. Comparisons of computed Φ values with the corresponding experimental values are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">7</xref>B for CI2 and barnase, respectively. It is clear from the comparisons that the computed Φ values are not in perfect quantitative agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Nevertheless, the overall agreement is significant, especially so given that the simulation model was not in any way parameterized to capture these data: the <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> values of the correlations for CI2 and barnase are 0.37 and 0.77, respectively (the clearly rather poor correlation for CI2 is at least consistent with very recent results obtained by the Wolynes group using a similar simulation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b052">52</xref>]). Although the correspondence with experiment is not overwhelming, the simulation model does at least correctly capture the fact that for CI2, residues with intermediate Φ values (Φ ~ 0.4) are distributed throughout the primary sequence, while for barnase, residues with high Φ values—which are those that are most structured in the transition state ensemble—are located predominantly in the C-terminal β-sheet.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020098-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Simulated Mechanisms of Refolding and De Novo Folding for CI2 and Barnase</title><p>(A) Comparison of computed and experimental Φ values for CI2.</p><p>(B) Same as (A), but for for barnase.</p><p>(C) Plot of Q<sub>res</sub> versus Q for refolding of CI2.</p><p>(D) Same as (C), but for refolding of barnase.</p><p>(E) Same as (C), but for the post-synthesis stage of de novo folding of CI2.</p><p>(F) Same as (C), but for the post-synthesis stage of de novo folding of barnase.</p><p>In panels (C–F), Q<sub>res</sub> values are shown on a continuous color scale between 0.0 (blue) and 0.75 (red) for CI2, and between 0.0 (blue) and 0.9 (red) for barnase.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g007" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>It is not straightforward to conduct a Φ-value analysis of the coupled–synthesis folding simulations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), nor would it be straightforward to do so experimentally. In order to provide an alternative means of comparing the mechanisms of de novo folding and refolding, therefore, the residue-specific folding coordinate Q<sub>res</sub> discussed above was examined (results compiled in the remaining panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">Figure 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">Figure 7</xref>C shows how the mean Q<sub>res</sub> values for all residues in CI2 change as a function of the <italic>overall</italic> Q value during refolding simulations (essentially identical results are obtained from examining refolding from both random and denatured conformations); note that data for Q greater than 0.8 are poor because each refolding trajectory is terminated as soon as folding to Q = 0.95 first occurs (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Although these refolding simulations are performed under conditions in which the folded state of the protein is strongly thermodynamically favored, the view of the folding mechanism that emerges from this type of analysis is very similar to that obtained from the Φ-value analysis: in particular, at Q ~ 0.4, where the maximum in the plot of G versus Q occurs for the current model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), the more structured residues (red) correspond well with those showing higher Φ values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">Figure 7</xref>A. More important, however, is the fact that this same type of analysis can also be applied to de novo folding trajectories, thus allowing us to investigate whether the simulated mechanisms for refolding and de novo folding differ significantly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">Figure 7</xref>E shows how the mean Q<sub>res</sub> values for residues in CI2 change as a function of the total Q value during the post-synthesis stage of the de novo folding simulation.

(In fact, their correlation coefficient is 0.98.) The same qualitative results are obtained with barnase: (1) the view of the refolding mechanism that is obtained from a Q<sub>res</sub> versus Q analysis is very similar to that obtained from Φ-value analysis, and (2) the simulated mechanisms of refolding and de novo folding are more or less identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">Figure 7</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">7</xref>F). For both of the small model proteins studied with the present simulation model then, the gradual, vectorial synthesis of the protein within the ribosome does not appear to effect any significant change in the folding mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Coupled Synthesis and Folding of Artificially Stabilized CI2</title><p>The above discussion has focused on the folding behavior of proteins whose energy parameters have been calibrated to reproduce the experimental free energy of folding of the full-length proteins; in these simulations it is clear that both CI2 and barnase fold essentially post-translationally. Since it was of interest to consider what might happen if a protein began to fold significantly <italic>during</italic> synthesis, additional sets of simulations were performed in which the energy parameter for CI2 was deliberately exaggerated (ɛ = 0.80 kcal/mol) to increase the folded state's stability: with this parameter, the smaller CI2 fragments discussed above are all largely folded at 300 K (unpublished data). In simulations performed with this energy parameter, refolding of the full-length protein becomes, as expected, notably faster: the median time for refolding from random conformations decreases from approximately 280 ns to approximately 50 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). In contrast, in the coupled synthesis–folding simulations, the distribution of de novo folding times becomes strikingly bimodal, with median folding times of approximately 130 ns and approximately 4.5 μs for the two sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). The faster folding sub-population comprises 67% of the trajectories and, as was observed with the more realistic energy parameter for CI2, appears to be limited by the time taken for the protein to diffuse out of the ribosome tunnel. The slower folding sub-population is more interesting: it comprises folding trajectories in which the protein forms significant tertiary structure while still positioned within the tunnel. With the present simulation model, the tunnel is not sufficiently wide to allow complete folding to occur, but it does allow significant partial structure formation (Q ~ 0.5), and since there is a constriction at the tunnel's exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b053">53</xref>], the partially folded protein is prevented from diffusing out into solution to continue folding (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g008">Figure 8</xref>B; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg004">Figure S4</xref> for snapshots from a typical trajectory).

In the simulations, the N-terminal domain shows a much more pronounced tendency to fold first, and both the folding of the C-terminal domain <italic>and</italic> the formation of the domain–domain interface show a tendency to occur simultaneously and in concert with synthesis. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g010">Figure 10</xref> for snapshots of a typical trajectory and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg008">Figure S8</xref> for all trajectories in Q<sub>N</sub>, Q<sub>C</sub>, Q<sub>INT</sub> space.)

A structural snapshot of the protein at the moment at which it attains its native structure, with the final crucial residue trp149 (trp267 in the numbering system of the full-length protein) folded into the enzyme's active site, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g009">Figure 9</xref>D. In ten coupled synthesis–folding simulations, the mean length of the nascent protein when the native structure of the serine protease module is attained is 180 ± 5 residues, indicating that an additional 31 residues must be synthesized before the nascent protein is capable of autoproteolysis. This number is somewhat shorter than the 43 residues estimated on the basis of in vivo experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b054">54</xref>], and this is perhaps attributable to the limited structural resolution of the current model and the fact that simulations are terminated as soon as the final residue is in place, an action that in effect corresponds to assuming that proteolysis occurs instantaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Sensitivity of Results to Parameters</title><p>Since a number of the parameters of the current simulation model could reasonably be assigned a range of values, additional simulations were performed to investigate the robustness of some of the behavior(s) described above; the results of these studies are compiled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g011">Figure 11</xref>. As noted above, one important parameter to investigate is the rate at which new amino acids are “synthesized” in the coupled synthesis–folding simulations. As discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, an attempt to match the simulations' relative rates of synthesis and folding with those of experiments suggests that a reasonable rate of addition is one amino acid per 100 ns, and this is, therefore, the rate that has been used throughout all simulations discussed up to this point. To test the effects of both faster and slower rates of synthesis, however, ribosome-mediated simulations of CI2 were performed with amino acids added at a rate of one per 10 ns and at a rate of one per 1,000 ns. Plots of the mean folding coordinate Q as a function of time for these three sets of simulations are shown for the period during synthesis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g011">Figure 11</xref>A. From this it can be seen that the plots obtained for synthesis times of 100 ns and 1,000 ns are essentially identical, suggesting that the rate of synthesis in the former case is already sufficiently slow that it allows complete or near-complete configurational sampling and that use of a much slower synthesis rate (which would dramatically decrease the number of simulations that could be performed with a given amount of computer time) is unnecessary. Interestingly, however, the plot obtained for a synthesis time of 10 ns differs significantly—and in such a way that the formation of tertiary structure during synthesis is actually increased. This latter effect appears to result from amino acids being synthesized more rapidly than they can diffuse out of the ribosome tunnel, with the resulting transient increase in the local concentration of residues promoting the formation of residue–residue contacts.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020098-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>A Typical Coupled Synthesis–Folding Simulation of SFVP</title><p>Snapshots from a typical de novo folding simulation of SFVP in the presence of the ribosome (grey surface).

(Complete comparisons showing error bars are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg011">Figure S11</xref>.) It is apparent from these plots that increasing the degree of confinement within the tunnel decreases the extent of tertiary structure formation during the early stages of synthesis (when the nascent chain is 20–40 residues long), but by the final stages of synthesis, it appears to make little difference. A comparison of the individual Q<sub>res</sub> values computed for each residue during the synthesis of the final amino acid indicates that the overall structure of the protein at this point of the simulation is unaffected by the increased size of the ribosome atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g011">Figure 11</xref>D). As might therefore be expected, a comparison of Q<sub>res</sub> versus Q plots for the period following synthesis indicates that the overall de novo folding mechanism is essentially unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg012">Figure S12</xref>). There is, however, a suggestion that for the most confined case (σ<sub>ij</sub> = 6.0 Å), the formation of the native structure is somewhat slowed (the <italic>p</italic>-value for the H<sub>0</sub> hypothesis that the de novo median folding times obtained with σ<sub>ij</sub> = 4.0 and 6.0 Å are identical is less than 0.44): this almost certainly reflects the increased difficulty that the newly synthesized chain encounters in “wriggling free” of the ribosome.</p><p>A third aspect that was investigated was the effect of including favorable energetic interactions between the nascent protein chain and the ribosome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In this case, the inclusion of progressively favorable interactions increases the level of tertiary structure formation during <italic>all</italic> stages of synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g011">Figure 11</xref>C; complete comparisons showing error bars are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg011">Figure S11</xref>); this result presumably reflects the less-confined environment experienced by the nascent chain when its repulsive interactions with the walls of the tunnel are replaced by attractive interactions. Examination of the Q<sub>res</sub> values of all residues shows that the increase in the overall Q during the synthesis of the final residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g011">Figure 11</xref>E) is due primarily to increased structure in the C-terminal residues (residues ~30 and up). There is also a significant slowing down in the rate of de novo folding when attractive interactions are included (the median folding time increases from 227 ns without attractive interactions to approximately 570 ns in the most attractive case), suggesting, perhaps not surprisingly, that some sticking of the nascent chain to (or within) the tunnel does occur. As was observed in the case of increasing the ribosome atom radii, however, no dramatic change of the de novo folding mechanism occurs in the post-synthesis stage of the simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg012">Figure S12</xref>).</p><p>A final aspect that was investigated was the effect of altering the balance between local and non-local interactions in the protein energetic model. As noted in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, the adjustment of the energy parameter ɛ to match the experimental folding free energy was made in such a way as to keep constant the ratio of the (local) dihedral angle barrier heights to the (non-local) native non-bonded interaction well depths. It is, of course, possible to match the experimental folding free energy with different weights applied to the local and non-local terms: a weakened set of non-bonded Gō interactions can be compensated for by strengthening the dihedral angle terms, which drive the chain to adopt the correct local secondary structure. All CI2 simulations discussed up to this point assigned a barrier height of 0.50 kcal/mol to the dihedral potential V<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), but to investigate the sensitivity of results to this parameter, additional sets of simulations were performed with V<sub>1</sub> = 0.125, 0.25, and 1.0 kcal/mol respectively. The results of these simulations are compiled in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg013">Figure S13</xref> from which it can be seen that the use of alternative parameter sets does not significantly affect any conclusions drawn here concerning ribosome-mediated folding: in particular, in all cases, confinement within the ribosome results in a general suppression of structure formation relative to what is observed in absence of the ribosome, but there are periods during synthesis where Q undergoes a clear though transient decrease. It is encouraging to see that the parameter set used in most of the simulations reported here (V<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 kcal/mol) produces the most cooperative folding behavior of all parameter sets tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg013">Figure S13</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg013">S13</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>As always with work based entirely on the use of computer simulations, it is not only important to test the effects of changing parameter values (see previous section), it is also necessary to state and evaluate the assumptions and approximations that are implicit in the approach. A first key assumption of the present work is that a rather simple simulation model developed to study protein refolding events can be extended and applied to model the more complex phenomenon of coupled synthesis and folding within the large ribosomal subunit. The limitations of Gō-type models are well known (for an extended discussion see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sd001">Text S1</xref>), and the impact of these limitations is clearly felt in some of the aspects considered here: the close examinations of structure in the fragments and the only rough agreement between the computed and experimental Φ values both indicate that specific details of the folding mechanisms and equilibria are not perfectly reproduced by the model. These drawbacks are, however, to be considered in the context of the method's significant advantages, not least of which is the fact that it is its computational simplicity that makes the rather wide range of simulations discussed here feasible with usual computational resources. Moreover, the new <italic>refolding</italic> results presented here—indicating that increases in stability and folding cooperativity with increasing fragment lengths are correctly captured—provide further demonstrations that this very simple computational model can give surprisingly robust descriptions of real protein behavior (but see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sd001">Text S1</xref> for more on this subject). The quite close agreement between the mean computed Q values of fragments and the fluorescence intensities measured experimentally by the Fersht group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">1</xref>D) seems especially notable. It is, of course, important to recognize that such a comparison assumes that the fluorescence intensity provides a meaningful measure of how “folded” each fragment is, whereas in reality it simply reports on the local environment experienced by the fluorophores (as well as their number), but for both model proteins studied here, this appears to be a reasonable assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b036">36</xref>]. In the same vein, it is perhaps worth noting that the somewhat less-successful description of <italic>local</italic> secondary and tertiary structure formation for these proteins might also stem in part from a similar disconnect between the simulation and experimental observables: CD spectra for example are a composite of contributions from multiple structural elements, and do not, therefore, always lend themselves to direct comparisons with computed secondary structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b036">36</xref>]; this is especially likely to be an issue with barnase since the native protein's far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum does not correspond with expectations based on its known secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b056">56</xref>]. As a final note on the subject of fragment stabilities, it is worth mentioning that the Cavagnero group has proposed using differences in solvent-accessible surface areas as a means of predicting the relative stabilities of N-terminal fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b057">57</xref>].</p><p>A second issue to be considered is the extent to which the results discussed here might depend on the choice of the reaction coordinate used to monitor folding. The subject of whether the fraction of native contacts, Q, represents a good reaction coordinate continues to attract a considerable amount of discussion in the literature, and a question of particular interest is whether finding the maximum in the plot of free energy versus Q provides a safe way of identifying those protein conformations that are members of the transition state ensemble (TSE) for folding. Although making this assumption is very convenient—and was used here to calculate the Φ values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g007">7</xref>B—it has been argued by Shakhnovich, Pande, and others that the members of the TSE should instead be identified by explicitly demonstrating that they have a probability of proceeding to the folded state (P<sub>fold</sub>) of 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b059">59</xref>]. Wolynes and coworkers on the other hand have argued that the P<sub>fold</sub> approach can itself lead to difficulties when applied to more-complex folding mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b052">52</xref>], and have shown that for a few test cases (including CI2), there is in any case a reasonable correspondence between the two approaches. This issue has also been considered in the present work for both CI2 and barnase: explicit computation of P<sub>fold</sub> for a large number of conformations segregated by their Q values indicates that those with Q values corresponding to the maximum in the plot of G versus Q do have on average a P<sub>fold</sub> of approximately 0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg014">Figure S14</xref>; it should also be noted, however, that the distribution of P<sub>fold</sub> values does not center on this value, but instead is bimodal). While this correspondence provides some support for the present work's use of Q as the primary descriptor of the extent of folding, two additional points should also be remembered. First, throughout this work we have taken care to compare the folding behavior observed in coupled synthesis–folding simulations performed in the presence of the ribosome with either (1) refolding from random or denatured conformations, or (2) coupled synthesis–folding simulations performed in the absence of the ribosome: in all of these comparisons, identical reaction coordinate definitions have been used, so at least some of the concerns that might remain about an inappropriate choice of reaction coordinate would be expected to cancel out. Second, any over-reliance on Q has been mitigated where practical by extending discussion of the simulated folding mechanism to consideration of Q values for individual residues (Q<sub>res</sub>), thus allowing a considerably more detailed view of the mechanism to be obtained.</p><p>A third issue to discuss concerns the simulated timescales of both protein folding and protein synthesis. The artificially rapid folding that occurs in the simulations is a consequence of the huge simplification of the energy landscape that attends the structural assumptions made (i.e., the C<sub>α</sub>-only protein model) and its barrier-free description of residue–residue interactions. A closer connection between the simulated and experimental timescales of folding is to be expected in (atomically detailed) simulations of protein folding events that do not make such assumptions, such as the massive distributed computing simulations pioneered by the Pande group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b061">61</xref>] and those that specifically address very fast folding reactions (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b062">62</xref>]). Recognition of the disconnect between the simulated and experimental timescales appears to be one reason why many simulation studies that use structurally simplified models report folding kinetics only in terms of reduced units (such as simulation “steps”); in our view, however, this tends to obscure what is actually a real difference, so the nanosecond–microsecond timescale of the simulations has been identified explicitly here. Of course, it should be remembered that for most purposes, the discrepancy between simulated and experimental timescales is unimportant since <italic>relative</italic> folding rates can still be directly compared with one another—often with extremely good results (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b031">31</xref>]).</p><p>In the present context, however, the disparity is potentially of greater significance since there is a second key timescale that must also be considered if the simulation model is to behave realistically: this is the rate of protein synthesis. It is, therefore, important to recall that all coupled synthesis–folding simulations reported here were conducted with the rate of synthesis explicitly matched with that of folding so that their relative rates are consistent with experiment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). That said, it should also be noted that this matching has been done assuming that amino acid synthesis occurs at a constant rate; in reality, however, there can be significant variations (up to 25-fold) in translation rates, depending on the availability of the appropriate cognate tRNAs (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b063">63</xref>]), the nature of the base-pairing interaction between codon and anticodon (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b065">65</xref>]), and/or the presence of secondary structure in the coding mRNA (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b066">66</xref>]). There has been some discussion in the literature that slowly translated regions may, in general, occur at boundaries between protein domains (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b068">68</xref>]), and this issue could be investigated in future for proteins in which the effects of different codons on translational pausing have been studied (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b069">69</xref>]). For the more limited goals of the present work, however, the comparison shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g011">Figure 11</xref>A suggests that the choice of a (constant) simulated rate of one amino acid per 100 ns at least provides a reasonable compromise between the need to allow the nascent chain to sample a wide range of conformations during synthesis and the need to make the simulations sufficiently rapid that many independent trajectories, performed under many different simulation conditions, can be obtained.</p><p>A final issue that needs to be addressed is the level of structural detail employed in the model of the nascent protein and the nature of its interaction with the ribosome. It is clearly a major simplification to strip away the sidechains, to ignore non-native interactions within the protein, and to overlook (in most of the simulations reported here) the possibility of favorable energetic interactions between the nascent chain and the ribosome. Before dismissing the entire body of work, however, it should be remembered that all of these assumptions—unpalatable as some of them undoubtedly are—have been made in the interests of computational feasibility. The simulations in which increasing radii were assigned to the ribosome atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g011">Figure 11</xref>B) can be thought of as crudely mimicking what might happen if the nascent protein was made more bulky by the inclusion of its sidechains, but they are, of course, unlikely to be a perfect substitute for simulations in which sidechains are explicitly represented. Developing a model of the latter type is, therefore, a clear and important goal for the near future. That said, it should not be assumed that a (properly parameterized) protein model in which sidechains are explicitly represented would automatically lead to a more realistic view of cotranslational folding: it may be, for example, that one would then also need to explicitly model the conformational dynamics of the ribosome itself in order for the now-bulkier protein to diffuse out of the tunnel. Although there have already been studies reported in the literature in which the conformational dynamics of the ribosome have been modeled (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b072">72</xref>]), including such dynamics while modeling protein synthesis would likely dramatically increase the computational burden associated with the simulations.</p><p>With all of the above issues in mind, it is worth reiterating that the coupled synthesis–folding simulations have produced three main results. First, for the comparatively simple proteins CI2 and barnase, the simulated de novo folding mechanisms are more or less identical to those for refolding, and the folding kinetics are effectively indistinguishable from those for refolding from conformations sampled from the denatured ensemble. Although it might be argued that the same conclusion could be reached simply on the basis of the known lower stability of N-terminal fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b033">33</xref>], the simulations reported here place this reasoning on a firmer footing by showing that confinement of the nascent protein within the ribosome tunnel during the early stages of its synthesis does not appear to significantly affect its folding. The present results, therefore, provide support for the use of in vitro refolding experiments as models of in vivo folding for simple globular proteins.</p><p>The fact that confinement of the nascent protein chain within the ribosome tunnel does not appear to promote structure formation deserves further comment, not only because of the current interest in confinement effects in general, but also because of its connection with important recent experimental work. The fluorescence-resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments conducted by the Johnson group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b074">74</xref>] and the pegylation-based “molecular tape measure” experiments performed by the Deutsch group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b075">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b076">76</xref>] have both provided strong evidence that a significant structural compaction of nascent peptides can occur within the ribosome tunnel; although not directly demonstrated, the most straightforward interpretation of these experiments is that the nascent peptides assume helical conformations. Especially interesting are the Deutsch group's recent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b076">76</xref>] indicating that the extent of compaction can vary significantly depending on the location within the tunnel; a thermodynamic model was used to estimate that the contribution made by the ribosome to structure formation was up to 1 kcal/mol. The <italic>cause</italic> of this stabilization of compact structure is more difficult to establish, and possible factors suggested by the authors included interactions between the nascent peptide and non-polar sidechains in the tunnel, locally altered water activity modulating the hydrophobic effect, and confinement effects.</p><p>The latter idea has been investigated by Thirumalai and colleagues with a simple cylindrical model for the ribosome tunnel, and has led them to the conclusion that significant stabilization of an α-helix can occur depending on the diameter assigned to the cylinder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b022">22</xref>]. In contrast, the present simulations suggest that for the particular sequences studied here (which adopt predominantly β-sheet conformations), confinement <italic>alone</italic> does not cause appreciable changes in the degree of structure formation. It should be noted that the present simulations use a much more detailed model of the ribosome tunnel than that used by the Thirumalai group, and focus on (quite different) proteins for which the simulated description of fragment stabilities has been shown to be in good agreement with experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g001">1</xref>D). It is also important to note that the present simulations correctly capture the Deutsch group's finding that the extent of structure formation can both increase and decrease depending on the length of the nascent chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g005">5</xref>D), although since the proteins studied here are different from those investigated experimentally, it is not possible to make a direct comparison between the two studies. It seems likely, in fact, that this type of behavior may turn out to be quite dependent both on the nature of the nascent protein's sequence and its native structure.</p><p>The second main result of the coupled synthesis–folding simulations is that in contrast to what is seen with the simpler model proteins CI2 and barnase, for the two-domain protease module of SFVP, the simulated de novo folding and refolding mechanisms differ significantly. In the simulations, refolding occurs primarily by independent folding of the N- and C-domains—with the former being slightly more likely to fold first—followed by association of the two folded domains. The de novo folding pathway, on the other hand, often occurs by gradual accretion of C-domain structure onto a pre-folded N-domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg008">Figures S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg009">S9</xref>). The view of refolding obtained from the simulations is only partly consistent with the interpretation of recent experiments on SFVP's refolding kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b055">55</xref>], although given that the latter studies have not yet been extended to give the more structurally resolved view obtainable from Φ-value analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b051">51</xref>], it is not yet certain that the experimental and simulation results are actually inconsistent with one another. The more important point here, however, is that the differences observed between the de novo folding and refolding mechanisms of SFVP suggest that, while the folding mechanisms for the two scenarios might be identical for single or isolated domains, the same may not be true for the assembly of multi-domain proteins.</p><p>The final and perhaps most interesting set of results obtained from the de novo folding simulations is that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020098-g008">Figure 8</xref>: with an artificially stabilized version of CI2, the rate of folding (or perhaps more correctly, the rate of adopting the native conformation) is severely compromised for a significant fraction of the molecules because of entrapment of partially folded conformations in the ribosome tunnel. It is important to note that this effect does <italic>not</italic> result from any attractive interaction between the atoms of the protein and the ribosome, since in the simulations discussed, all such interactions are purely repulsive. Instead, it is the protein—by stubbornly refusing to transiently unfold when faced with a constricted exit—that prevents its own escape. There has already been some discussion in the literature that cooperativity in protein folding might be evolutionarily advantageous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b077">77</xref>], and the present results provide an intriguing additional argument to this effect: the premature (non-cooperative) acquisition of stable tertiary structure within the ribosome tunnel could hinder the rapid release and folding of individual protein domains. Of course, this is not to exclude the possibility that smaller elements of (secondary) structure might form: as noted above, there is now considerable evidence for conformational preferences being expressed in short nascent sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b073">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b078">78</xref>]. In addition, electron density observed in recent cryo-electron microscopy studies also indicates a degree of structure formation in the tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b079">79</xref>].</p><p>In closing, it should be noted that there is clearly a number of complexities to the behavior of nascent protein sequences within the ribosome that are not captured in the present simulation model. Nascent sequences can regulate translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b080">80</xref>] through direct interference with the peptidyltransferase site or by interaction with proteins further down the tunnel, and FRET-based studies have indicated that these interactions can cause far-reaching conformational changes in the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b081">81</xref>]. Extension of the present simulation model to describe some of these complexities should eventually prove possible: in addition to overcoming some of the basic structural and energetic assumptions discussed above, it will be important to develop a more realistic description of the process of synthesis that incorporates a mechanism for feeding back binding events within the tunnel to the peptidyltransferase site. Future studies along these lines should have the potential to provide considerable new insights into both the mechanism and regulation of protein folding in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>The protein model.</title><p>The structural and energetic model used in the simulations reported here is essentially identical to the Gō model employed by Clementi, Onuchic, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b032">32</xref>].

				</p><p>The energetic parameters ɛ, V<sub>1</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub> were initially set to 0.6, 0.5, and 0.25 kcal/mol, respectively, because these parameters approximately reproduced the experimental folding free energy of CI2 in water at 25 °C, ΔG°<sub>fold</sub> = −7 kcal/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b039">39</xref>]. For barnase, a series of simulations was performed in which the three parameters were all scaled by a single factor until the experimental ΔG°<sub>fold</sub> of −9 kcal/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b040">40</xref>] was approximately reproduced: the optimized values selected in this way were 0.57, 0.475, and 0.2375 kcal/mol, respectively. Scaling the three energy terms by a single factor is an attempt to maintain an energetic balance between the non-local interactions (controlled by ɛ) and the local interactions (controlled by V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>3</sub>): previous work has shown that this balance can significantly affect simulated folding behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b087">87</xref>]. For the considerably larger serine protease module of SFVP, computational expense prevented systematic optimization of the energy parameters to reproduce ΔG°<sub>fold</sub>. Instead, simulations were performed with a range of values ɛ = 0.54, 0.57, and 0.60 kcal/mol (with V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>3</sub> again being scaled by the same factor to maintain the balance of non-local and local terms). As described in Results, a series of simulations of CI2 was also performed with parameters that deliberately exaggerated its stability: the values of ɛ, V<sub>1</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub> in these simulations were 0.8, 0.6667, and 0.3333 kcal/mol, respectively. Finally, in order to test the effects of altering the balance between local and non-local interactions in the protein model, 30 independent simulations of CI2 were also performed with each of three additional alternative sets of parameters tuned to match the experimental ΔG°<sub>fold</sub> of CI2 at 300 K (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020098-sg013">Figure S13</xref>); the values of ɛ, V<sub>1</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub> in these three sets were (1) 0.7795, 0.125, and 0.0625 kcal/mol, (2) 0.7121, 0.25, and 0.125 kcal/mol, and (3) 0.4604, 1.0, and 0.5 kcal/mol.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>The simulation algorithm.</title><p>The time-dependent conformational behavior of each protein of interest was simulated with the Brownian dynamics (BD) algorithm developed by Ermak and McCammon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b088">88</xref>] and implemented in software written by the author. Each C<sub>α</sub> pseudo-atom was assigned a diffusion coefficient of 0.1 Å<sup>2</sup> ps<sup>−1</sup>, and an integration timestep of 25 fs was used throughout. To accelerate the simulations, interactions between nonbonded residues were only computed when they were within 10 Å (for non-native residue pairs) or σ<sub>ij</sub> + 6 Å (for native residue pairs); the residue pairs satisfying these distance requirements were entered in a list that was recomputed every 20 integration steps.

Using this definition, Q = 0 corresponds to a protein conformation so completely unfolded that it contains no native contacts at all, whereas Q = 1 indicates a fully folded protein; Q is therefore often referred to as an “order parameter.” For both CI2 and barnase, calibration of the energy parameters (see above) was achieved by performing simulations of 100-μs length near the folding temperature T<sub>fold</sub>, (i.e., the temperature at which ΔG°<sub>fold</sub> = 0), and computing the free energy at 300 K using now-standard histogram techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b090">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b091">91</xref>].

Computationally, simulating the refolding kinetics of a large number of mutants directly would be a very expensive undertaking since it would require many individual trajectories to be computed for each mutant. To avoid this computational expense, the kinetic component of the Φ value can instead be calculated from the same one-dimensional folding free energy landscape used to obtain the thermodynamic component of the Φ value, by examining the effects of a mutation on the height of the free energy barrier to folding at T<sub>fold</sub>. This approach requires only that the folding free energy landscape for each mutant be computed, which as discussed above, can be achieved by performing 100-μs simulations. In the present study, mutations to alanine were modeled simply by removing all atoms of a sidechain beyond the C<sub>β</sub> atom and re-computing the set of Gō-interacting residue pairs in the same way as done for the wild-type protein. Since in a number of cases this removal of the additional atoms did not result in any change of the list of Gō pairs, it was not possible to compute Φ values for these mutants (since their energies would be identical to those of the wild-type protein). Where possible however, Φ values were computed with the usual expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b051">51</xref>] Φ = ΔΔG°<sup>U−‡</sup>/ΔΔG°<sup>U−F</sup> where ΔΔG°<sup>U−‡</sup> represents the change in free energy difference between the unfolded state (U) and the “transition state” (‡) for folding, and ΔΔG°<sup>U−F</sup> represents the change in the free energy difference between the unfolded (U) and folded (F) states.</p><p>An implicit assumption in the above approach is that the maximum in the plot of G versus Q adequately represents the transition state such that structures with this value of Q have the same probability of proceeding to the folded state as they do of proceeding to the unfolded state ensemble. This assumption was tested explicitly in the following way. Structural snapshots were first sorted into bins based on their Q value (with bin widths of 0.025 units). From those bins of interest, 500 snapshots were randomly selected, and each selected snapshot was used as a starting point for computing 20 independent folding trajectories. Trajectories were continued until the either the folded or unfolded state ensembles were reached: for CI2, trajectories were terminated when Q &lt; 0.175 or Q &gt; 0.875 was reached; for barnase, trajectories were terminated when Q &lt; 0.275 or Q &gt; 0.825 was reached.

The ribosomal proteins in this structure are present at the same C<sub>α</sub> level of resolution used to model the nascent protein in the BD simulations. The RNA, however, is represented at true atomic resolution, so in order that the simulated resolution of the proteins and nucleic acids be approximately similar in the simulations, all but the following RNA atoms in the structure were deleted: P, C1′, C3′, and C5′ atoms of the sugar-phosphate backbone, the N3, C6, and N7 atoms of purine bases, and the N3 and C5 atoms of pyrimidine bases. In order to allow the nascent protein to fit within the peptidyltransferase active site without experiencing major steric clashes, two additional atoms were removed: C6 of Ade2103 and C5 of Cyt2644. Even with these changes, the density of pseudo-atoms within the RNA is still somewhat greater than that within the protein parts of the ribosome; this, however, was found to be necessary to prevent the nascent protein burrowing unrealistically through the center of RNA helices. Interactions between pseudo-atoms of the nascent protein and the ribosome were modeled with the same purely repulsive energy function outlined above (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi-0020098-e003">Equation 3</xref>) for describing non-native interactions within the protein; σ<sub>ij</sub> was set to 4 Å and ɛ was set in all simulations to 0.6 kcal/mol.

Although in most of the simulations reported here there were no favorable energetic interactions between atoms of the nascent protein and the ribosome, additional simulations were also conducted in which the combined attractive–repulsive energy function (Equation 2) was used in place of the purely repulsive energy function (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>); σ<sub>ij</sub> was set to 4 Å, and 30 independent simulations were performed for ɛ values of 0.1 and 0.2 kcal/mol.</p><p>The synthesis and release of nascent protein transcripts was modeled within the ribosomal subunit in the following way. Simulations were begun with the first four residues of the protein already synthesized in the peptidyltransferase site and arranged in a <italic>trans</italic>-orientation (such that they formed a pseudo-dihedral angle of 180°), pointed roughly in the direction of the tunnel's exit. Residue 5 of the protein was initially placed in a position displaced 3 Å in the +<italic>x</italic> direction into the peptidyltransferase site. At the start of the simulation, only residues 1 to 4 were allowed to move freely according to the dictates of the BD algorithm; over each of 4 million simulation steps, however, residues 4 and 5 were both subjected to small translations of 7.5 × 10<sup>−7</sup> Å in the −<italic>x</italic> direction until residue 5 was positioned at the same <italic>x</italic>-coordinate occupied by residue 4 at the beginning of the simulation. When this point was reached, residue 5 was released and allowed to freely move during BD, and the series of small translations (this time applied to residues 5 and 6) repeated in order to gradually introduce residue 6. This process was repeated until all residues of the protein were introduced and released. For CI2, barnase, and SFVP, the number of coupled synthesis–folding simulations performed for each set of energy parameters was 50, 30, and 10, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Ensuring compatibility of simulated timescales.</title><p>The computed folding times of proteins represented by structurally simplified Gō models are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding experimental folding times; despite this the <italic>relative</italic> rates of folding of various single-domain proteins (at their folding temperatures) have been shown to be in surprisingly close agreement with experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b031">31</xref>]. The disparity between experimental and simulation timescales takes on added importance in the present context, however, since it is vital that the rates of amino acid synthesis and protein folding be realistically matched in the simulations. In particular, a major concern is that if the simulated rate of synthesis is too high relative to the simulated folding rate (or the rate at which relaxation of the structure occurs), amino acids might rapidly “bunch up” unrealistically at the site of their synthesis. A secondary concern (secondary in the sense that it is less likely to be encountered) is that if the simulated rate of synthesis is too low, the protein's ability to sample widely different alternative conformations during synthesis might be unrealistically high.</p><p>In an attempt to determine an appropriate rate for “synthesizing” residues in the simulations, the experimental translation rate was first compared to the experimental refolding rates of CI2 and barnase. Although in vivo rates of translation can vary considerably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b065">65</xref>], they can average around 20 residues per second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b093">93</xref>], which is similar to the experimentally measured refolding rates of both CI2 and barnase in water (50s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b039">39</xref>] and 13s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020098-b042">42</xref>], respectively). The same proteins refold in the simulations with median folding times of approximately 280 ns and approximately 395 ns, respectively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>) which indicates that new amino acids should be introduced in the simulations at intervals of perhaps a few hundred nanoseconds; because of computational considerations, a value of 100 ns was chosen, which, as noted above, corresponds to 4 million simulation steps. Control simulations of CI2 without favorable Gō interactions (and without the ribosome) indicated that this rate was sufficiently slow that the protein's radius of gyration remained at or near its equilibrium value throughout synthesis (unpublished data). As a more explicit test of the effects of using alternative timescales of synthesis, sets of 50 and five simulations were performed in which new amino acids were introduced at intervals of 10 ns and 1,000 ns, respectively; the smaller number of trajectories performed with the longer timescale of synthesis reflects the much greater computational overhead associated with such simulations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020098-sg001" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020098.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Folding Free Energy Surfaces for Barnase Fragments</title><p>(A–F) Free energy surfaces for fragments comprising residues 23–109, 1–68, 1–79, 1–95, 1–105 and 1–109 (full length), respectively.
