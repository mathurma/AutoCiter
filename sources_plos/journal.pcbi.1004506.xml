<abstract>
<p>Synthetic lethality is a genetic interaction wherein two otherwise nonessential genes cause cellular inviability when knocked out simultaneously. Drugs can mimic genetic knock-out effects; therefore, our understanding of promiscuous drugs, polypharmacology-related adverse drug reactions, and multi-drug therapies, especially cancer combination therapy, may be informed by a deeper understanding of synthetic lethality. However, the colossal experimental burden in humans necessitates <italic>in silico</italic> methods to guide the identification of synthetic lethal pairs. Here, we present SINaTRA (Species-INdependent TRAnslation), a network-based methodology that discovers genome-wide synthetic lethality in translation between species. SINaTRA uses connectivity homology, defined as biological connectivity patterns that persist across species, to identify synthetic lethal pairs. Importantly, our approach does not rely on genetic homology or structural and functional similarity, and it significantly outperforms models utilizing these data. We validate SINaTRA by predicting synthetic lethality in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> using <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> data, then identify over one million putative human synthetic lethal pairs to guide experimental approaches. We highlight the translational applications of our algorithm for drug discovery by identifying clusters of genes significantly enriched for single- and multi-drug cancer therapies.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Synthetic lethality is a genetic interaction that has promising implications for informing novel cancer therapies. Over 200 million pairwise tests would be required to identify all pairwise synthetic lethal interactions in humans–currently, an impossibly large experimental burden. To simplify the process, we have developed a method to predict human synthetic lethal pairs in translation from a well-studied species to one in which synthetic lethality is understudied using both species’ protein-protein interaction networks. Here, we explore the model’s success in translation from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. We then predict human synthetic lethality and suggest novel areas of inquiry for cancer therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synthetic lethality (SL) occurs when two nonessential genes cause cellular inviability after being knocked out simultaneously.[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although SL was originally studied and described in yeast, it can be a powerful tool for studying drug action in humans; for example, SL may guide the development of cancer combination therapy[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and inform drug-drug interactions. SL interactions may differ between cellular contexts;[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] a gene pair that is SL in one cell type may not be SL in another. This can provide a tremendous therapeutic boon when two drugs targeting two gene products mimic an SL interaction in cancer cells and leave healthy cells unaffected. However, drug-induced SL interactions may also cause adverse events via unexpected cell death. Thus, mapping SL in humans is necessary to understanding mono- and polypharmacological effects.</p>
<p>Most gene pairs have not been interrogated for SL in humans, and several factors impede a species-wide evaluation of SL. These include the ethical implications of studying SL directly, the inability to discern state-specific SL interactions from global ones in experimental cell lines (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. cancer[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), and–most significantly–the heavy experimental burden. Over 200 million assays would be required to determine the SL status of all human gene pairs in just a single cellular context. <italic>In silico</italic> methods are therefore necessary to guide the identification of SL in humans.</p>
<p>Previous work on leveraging model organisms to predict human SL has focused in particular on genetic homology, under the hypothesis that SL status will be maintained between orthologous gene pairs.[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This approach has two major limitations. First, there are only ~2,000 genes that genetically homologous between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and humans (NCBI Homologene[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). These homologues account for a mere 1% of all possible human pairs, leaving the majority with no predictive data regarding SL status.</p>
<p>Second, genetic redundancies that developed independently in each species since deviation from a common ancestor may affect synthetic lethal status. For example, 228 gene duplication events have been suggested between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]in the ~400 million years of evolution between the two species;[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] this number is likely even higher between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and humans. Each of these events may introduce a functional redundancy that alters SL relationships in the organism by causing a gain or loss of SL. Focusing solely on genetic homology does not account for these complexities.</p>
<p>In this work, we first evaluate the performance of genetic homology in predicting SL. We also consider structural similarity using protein structure families, domain similarity using protein domains, and functional similarity with gene ontology annotations. We additionally consider information centrality, a univariate network-based model. We show that homology, structural similarity, and information centrality are limited in their ability to predict SL.</p>
<p>We then introduce the concept of <italic>connectivity homology</italic>, a measure of relatedness between genes that is independent of structure, function, or genetic homology. Relationships between genes and proteins, including redundancies, may be illustrated through the use of biological networks, and we hypothesize that the network connectivity profiles between two genes will better characterize their potential for an SL relationship. In order to compute these profiles, we use well-known graph properties, such as degree centrality and shortest path.[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We next use machine learning and data from a well-studied organism, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, to train a model of synthetic lethality that can be applied to any species of interest. We show that our algorithm, Species-INdependent TRAnslation (SINaTRA), significantly outperforms previously published models of predicting SL in translation. Importantly, we can predict synthetic lethality in species without any known (i.e. experimentally validated) synthetic lethal pairs. The only necessary information is an experimentally derived protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We also show that the method is robust to network incompleteness.</p>
<p>We then use SINaTRA to predict SL in humans and assign each human gene pairs a score between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood that the two genes exhibit a synthetic lethal relationship. As a post-processing step to enrich our predictions, we use databases of population genetic variation in humans to filter out likely false positives. Finally, we evaluate of the biomedical implications of our human SL gene pairs by discovering “hot zones” of putative SL pairs that suggest novel cancer combination therapies.</p>

<title>Previous methods of modeling synthetic lethality: genetic homology, structural similarity, and functional similarity</title>
<p>We began our study by considering two published methods of predicting SL, protein homology[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and bi-nodal information centrality,[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and implemented the algorithms as described by the authors. In addition, we hypothesized that structural homology, domain homology, and functional homology may be able to predict SL and designed models based on these parameters for comparative analysis.</p>
<p>In Wu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] the authors constructed a model to predict SL in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, then hypothesized that human gene pairs homologous to SL pairs in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> would also be SL in humans. We implemented the latter part of the approach and evaluated it by predicting SL in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. By restricting our analysis to only genes that are homologous between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, we find a significant predictive effect (OR = 145, 95% CI: 93–219, p &lt; 2.2e-16, Fisher’s exact test), corresponding to an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.60. Model performance decreased to OR = 45.9 (p&lt;2.2e-16) and an AUC = 0.52 when expanding the model to include all gene pairs (Materials and Methods).</p>
<p>We next hypothesized that structural, domain, and functional similarity may be predictors of SL. We trained these models in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and applied them to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. We used SCOP protein classifications to describe the former, and assigned each gene pair a value between 0 (no similarity) and 4 (same class) based on their products’ structural similarity. The model was trained and tested only on pairs with SCOP data associated with both genes. Only 399 SL pairs and 109,357 NSL pairs had SCOP data for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (16,765,399 pairs skipped) and 2 SL/298 NSL for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> (1,840,021 pairs skipped). The SCOP-based model had an AUC of 0.62. We additionally created a domain-based model from PFam[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to predict SL. Domain data exists for a larger number of proteins (9,424SL/10,280,492 NSL in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae;</italic> 514/1,431,764 for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>), allowing us to score more pairs than the SCOP-based model (Materials and Methods). The AUC in the domain-based model was 0.56.We described functional homology using annotations from Gene Ontology (GO) (Materials and Methods). Functional similarity attained an AUC of 0.81.</p>
<p>Finally, we calculated the pairwise information centrality[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and found no significant predictive performance identifying SL pairs (AUC = 0.46, Logistic Regression). Bi-nodal information centrality did not require interspecies translation.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that multivariate, network-based models of synthetic lethality would be able to capture SL interactions both within and between species more successfully.</p>

<title>Defining connectivity homology</title>
<p>We define two proteins as being <italic>connectivity homologous</italic> if they share similar connectivity profiles in their respective networks. A connectivity homologous relationship may exist between two proteins in the same species, or between proteins of different species. This concept can be generalized for pairs of proteins, or even groups of proteins (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. modules). For example, two pairs of proteins may be connectivity homologous because both pairs are connected to each other in a similar way.</p>
<p>We illustrate this concept in <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, where we present two networks of different sizes and topologies. Two network parameters are used to describe the network: degree (<italic>deg</italic>.) and betweenness centrality (<italic>bet</italic>. <italic>cent</italic>.). Each node contains its connectivity profile as a vector depicting the degree and betweenness centrality as ‘low’ (blue), ‘medium’ (white), or ‘high’ (red). Although the values may not be immediately comparable between networks, it is obvious that certain nodes share similar connectivity profiles, while some nodes do not have an interspecies, connectivity homologous pair (high deg./medium bet.cent.).</p>

We begin with the PPI networks of both our source and target species, calculate the network parameters (independently), and normalize the values of all parameters. Next, we use machine learning methods on the normalized network parameters of our source species as well as experimentally derived labels of synthetic lethality to construct a species-independent model of SL. Finally, we apply this model to the normalized network data of our target species in order to attain SL predictions in our target.</p>

<title>Connectivity homology can be evaluated with network parameters</title>
<p>In this paper, we represent connectivity profiles using vectors of network parameters. Each gene is represented by a vector of eight parameters (Tables <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).

For the purposes of this investigation, we chose to use protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks because of the wide availability of data across many species. PPI data was downloaded from BioGRID[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to construct graphs of one connected component (Materials and Methods).

<p>This result holds even when orthologs are not considered.

<title>Networks successfully predict within-species synthetic lethality</title>
<p>We used machine learning algorithms to build two models of synthetic lethality (SL) using the connectivity profiles we derived for pairs of proteins–one for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and one for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>. We trained these models using experimentally established SL gene pairs from BioGRID (N = 13,196 for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and N = 628 for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>) as our positive training examples. We randomly selected pairs not described as SL in the database as non-synthetic lethal (NSL) pairs, and used these as negative training examples. Our assumption that any pair without experimental evidence for synthetic lethality is NSL will be incorrect for a small number of pairs that are SL but have not yet been investigated; however, this will introduce negligible error due to the rarity of SL interactions (estimated 0.1% in dipoid organisms[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]).</p>
<p>We evaluated these models using cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

<title>Translation of synthetic lethality between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic></title>
<p>In order to create network models of synthetic lethality in translation, we developed the SINaTRA algorithm (Species INdependent TRAnslation). The schematic is illustrated in <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>To apply SINaTRA to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, we created two translational, network-based models that use data from a <italic>source</italic> species to infer the SL status of gene pairs in a <italic>target</italic> species. The first was trained on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> to predict SL in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>; the second was trained on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> to predict in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. For each model, we randomly selected an equal number of NSL pairs as SL pairs (13,196 for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>; 628 for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>). We built random forest models with 100 trees for each species. We evaluated these two models for their ability to predict SL gene pairs in the target species. Each model generates a SINaTRA score for each pair between 0 (predicted NSL) and 1 (predicted SL).</p>
<p>Using <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> as the source and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> as the target, we found that untranslated parameters resulted in poor inter-species SL prediction (AUC = 0.67). We tested all methods of normalization in translation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>) and found that the model significantly improves with any translational method with rank normalization performing best (AUC = 0.86; p&lt;2.2e-16, De Long’s method) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).

<title>SINaTRA outperforms translation-free and non-network methods</title>
<p>After evaluating SINaTRA in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, we compared its performance to those of models based on genetic homology and functional similarity. We show ROC curves of each previously discussed methods and compared it to that of SINaTRA (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) and use the AUC as a summary performance statistic. We additionally compared the performance of SINaTRA to domain similarity, structural similarity, and information centrality (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). We found that SINaTRA had significantly higher AUC than any other method we considered (p&lt;2.2e-16, DeLong’s test, all comparisons).</p>
<p>We then estimated the PPV for all gene pairs at 20 SINaTRA score thresholds (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>); the ratio of SL:NSL pairs was held at the expected ratio (1:1000[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). We found a significant improvement over chance (Odds ratio = 121.1, p = 2.72e-32, Fisher exact test). For example, at a SINaTRA score of 0.85, the PPV is approximately 7%—70 times higher than expected by chance (0.1%). It increases to 17% at a cutoff of 0.95, corresponding to a 170-fold increase. In comparison, the untranslated method of SL prediction rises to a PPV of 17% at a cutoff of 0.65 and dips sharply at 0.70. No gene pairs receive a score higher than 0.70 in the untranslated model.</p>
<p>We also found that no model out of genetic homology, functional similarity, structural similarity, or pairwise information centrality had a gene pair score higher than 0.05; therefore, we first identified which cutoff would provide the highest PPV, and plotted each value as dotted lines in <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>. We also provide a direct comparison between true and false positives and negatives for SINaTRA compared to homology in <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>. We found that, for all homologous pairs, the model achieves an OR of 144.9 (p&lt;2.2e-16, Fisher’s exact test), corresponding to an AUC of 0.60. In contrast, SINaTRA achieves an OR of 929.6 (p&lt;2.2e-16, Fisher’s exact test; <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>) and a corresponding of AUC = 0.91 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>) when using a SINaTRA cutoff of 0.85 on this same subset of pairs (any pair where at least one gene is not in the network is given a SINaTRA score of 0).</p>
<p>When we expand our data to the ‘whole genome,’ comprising all possible pairs from the set of Homologene and network genes (Materials and Methods), the homology-based method attains a lower, but significant, OR (OR = 60.1, p&lt;2.2e-16) and an AUC of 0.52. A similar expansion in SINaTRA yields an OR of 304.2 (p&lt;2.2e-16) when considering gene pairs with SINaTRA scores ≥ 0.85 as SL (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the independent contributions of the methods when combined with SINaTRA. We found that genetic homology, protein similarity, and univariate connectivity contributed no significant improvement in performance over the SINaTRA-only model. This result held for genetic homology even when considering only the subset of ~2 million gene pairs that are homologous between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> (<italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 407.66, p = 0.64).

The lowest density approximates that of the human and mouse PPI networks. Untranslated parameters achieve AUCs between 0.43 and 0.60 for all ablated graphs.

<title>Prediction of synthetic lethality is not driven by node popularity</title>
<p>Higher degree nodes are more likely to be studied, and more popularly studied genes may be more likely to be synthetic lethal. As a measure of this potential bias, we defined a normalized popularity measure (degree/popularity), where popularity is the number of times a particular gene appears in the BioGrid database. As expected, SINaTRA score is correlated with degree and, thus, popularity. However, SINaTRA score is not correlated with normalized popularity in any of the three species (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>).

<title>Protein complexes are significantly enriched for putative synthetic lethal pairs</title>
<p>A protein complex may be functional with one deleteriously mutated component, but present a lethal phenotype with two such mutations.[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Our results corroborate this pattern. We randomly selected 20 sets of mutually exclusive protein complexes with five subunits from the Comprehensive Resources of Mammalian Protein Complexes (CORUM) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and plotted the SINaTRA scores of all the associated genes as a heat map (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). We observed that genes with their products in the same protein complex had significantly higher SINaTRA scores (U = 3,425.5, p&lt;2.2e-16; <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Additionally, within-complex pairs were significantly enriched for higher SINaTRA scores for complexes of size ≤10 proteins (U = 3,114,511.5, p&lt;0.0001), and complexes of all sizes (U = 295,820,010, p&lt;0.0001). Finally, as the size of the complexes increases, the distributions of within-complex gene pair SINaTRA scores shifts to a left skew, echoing the distribution of gene pairs not in complexes. The proportion of gene pairs that have products in the same complex is significantly higher than expected by chance (p&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test, all SINaTRA score cutoffs) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>A. We randomly selected 20 mutually exclusive groups of protein complexes that contained exactly five subunits; we mapped the corresponding gene pairs to SINaTRA scores, and plotted a heat map of the results.</title>
<p>Data are not clustered and only one randomly sampling was performed. We observed that within-complex gene pairs have significantly higher SINaTRA scores (p&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). B. We compared the SINaTRA scores of gene pairs with products in the same vs. different complexes for complexes with of 5 protein subunits (top), ≤10 proteins (middle), and any number (bottom). Although proteins in the same complex are always enriched for higher SINaTRA score, as complex size increases, complex membership becomes less indicative of two genes being SL. C. We compared the fraction of gene pairs with products in the same vs. different complexes for three SINaTRA cutoffs (0.95, 0.80, 0.50) as well as for all gene pairs. A SINaTRA cutoff of 0.95 has approximately half of its pairs associated with the same complex; however, a decrease in the cutoff shifts this balance. This may indicate an increase in different mechanisms of SL in pairs with lower scores. “All Pairs” shows the expected proportion of in-complex pairs in our data.</p>

<title>Context-specific synthetic lethality</title>
<p>Synthetic lethality can change between contexts;[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] a gene pair that is SL in a cancer cell may not have the same property in healthy tissue. This may occur due to changes in protein expression, as well as activation or inactivation of protein pathways.</p>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> are unicellular organisms; therefore, models based on these species will necessarily focus on high-level, context-free synthetic lethal predictions. As such, the initial predictions from SINaTRA present all pairs that have synthetic lethal <italic>potential</italic> in their global connectivity patterns.</p>
<p>In order to explore context-specific SL pairs, we identified all human gene pairs with SINaTRA score ≥0.85. We next created tissue- and cell-line-specific lists of SL pairs by removing a gene pair if that tissue is not known to express both gene products according to the Human Protein Atlas.[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The proportion of SL pairs retained after filtering is illustrated in <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A</xref> (tissue) and <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B Fig</xref> (cell); bars are color-coded by biological system. Although the number of proteins removed from the network is correlated with the number of SL pairs filtered from each given tissue or cell line (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12C and S12D Fig</xref>), we find that the number of filtered SL pairs is, at times, lower or higher than expected by chance (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>) (Materials and Methods). For example, rectal tissue has approximately half as many SL pairs filtered out (70) as expected (146; OR = 0.477,p = 1.6e-5, Fisher’s exact test). In contrast, tissue of the small intestine has over twice as many SL pairs filtered (1653) than expected (826; OR = 2.11, p&lt;2.2e-16, Fisher’s exact test). Respiratory epithelial cells also have a high number of filtered SL pairs (O: 550, E: 280; OR = 2.00,p&lt;2.2e-16).</p>

<title>Comparisons with previously-published methods</title>
<p>Recent work on human SL includes the Syn-Lethality database,[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which compiles experimentally identified human SL pairs, and the DAISY method,[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] a computational method of identifying SL pairs. We found that the gene pairs from both datasets had significantly higher SINaTRA scores (Syn-Lethality: U = 12,265, p&lt;2.2e-16; DAISY (VHL): U = 299, p = 5.86e-6; DAISY (cancer): U = 1992856, p&lt;2.2e-16; <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Compared to the median of untested pairs (0.122; 99% CI: [0.122,0.122]), DAISY’s cancer predictions had a median score of 0.233 (99% CI: [0.225,0.243]); its VHL preditions had a median score of 0.255 (99% CI:[0.195,0.368]) and the Syn-Lethality dataset had a median score of 0.459 (99% CI: [0.397,0.514]).</p>
<p>From the Syn-Lethality database, we selected only SL gene pairs involving genetic deficiency, inactivation, or mutation. Of the 88 pairs matching these criteria, all were in our network, and we found 34 of these to have SINaTRA ≥0.5 (p = 4.8e-11, Fisher’s exact test), and 11 with SINaTRA≥0.75 (p = 0.0070, Fisher’s exact test). 2,816 gene pairs were predicted to be SL specifically in cancer using DAISY, 2,576 were in our network; we found that 151 had SINaTRA≥0.5 (p = 7.5e-24, Fisher’s exact test), and 14 had SINaTRA≥0.75 (p = 0.00096, Fisher’s exact test).</p>
<p>We observed that SINaTRA score was able to predict genes present in both the DAISY and Syn-Lethality datasets with AUCs of 0.73 and 0.93, respectively. (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). In turn, homology was not at all predictive in either dataset (AUC = 0.50 for both; no homology data present for the pairs), unlike functional annotations (AUC = 0.786, DAISY; AUC = 0.904, Syn-Lethality). We then considered the precision-recall curves of these data and found that SINaTRA in both datasets outperformed function in DAISY, while function in Syn-Lethality had similar performance to that of SINaTRA (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>The landscape of human synthetic lethality.</title>
<p>This network depicts all gene pairs with SINaTRA score ≥0.95 (1,229 SL pairs) that map to Reactome pathways (458 pairs). Here, each hexagon represents one high-level pathway designation in Reactome. Larger nodes indicate more SL pairs with that designation. Within the hexagonal nodes, we show the networks of synthetic lethality where both members have the same function in Reactome. Each node is a gene and an edge represents a predicted SL interaction. Gene nodes are weighted by degree and colored by closeness centrality. In turn, weighted edges join hexagonal nodes if pathway-divergent pairs exist; that is, one member of the pair is of one pathway while the second member is of the other. Edges are weighted by the number of pathway-divergent gene pairs associated with both pathways.</p>

<p>Among the within-pathway SL pairs, we found that apoptosis, the immune system, and gene expression have highly interconnected SL networks, indicated by low closeness centrality. The immune system has the highest number of associated SL gene pairs (101); the most central of these is RIPK1, with 15 connections. Several functions have no associated SL pairs, including extracellular matrix organization, metabolism of proteins, and reproduction. These functions may have little functional redundancy that allows for SL to occur. Of the between-pathway SL pairs, we found that each pair of pathways share an average of 2.8 SL pairs. The immune system/signal transduction between-pathway pairs are the most numerous (11 pairs).</p>

<title>Function-specific mechanisms of synthetic lethality</title>
<p>We grouped gene pairs into 17 high-level Reactome functional categories and clustered them by their parameter values (Materials and Methods). We found pathway-specific parameter enrichment exists in node-pair parameters (inverse shortest path, communicability, shared neighbors, and shared non-neighbors), but not in single-node parameters, as evidenced by the increase in variance of paired parameters versus single-node parameters (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). For example, the signal transduction pathway has higher values for node-pair parameters than other functions and all SL pairs. In contrast, apoptosis, DNA repair, and DNA replication have node-pair signals that are closer to the mean of all of its within-function pairs than other functions.</p>

<title>Function-specific patterns of synthetic lethality.</title>
<p>The heatmap represents the ratio of median parameters for the SL pairs of a given function versus all pairs of a given function. For example, the SL pairs of Signal Transduction have two-times greater values for inverse shortest path than for the non-SL pairs of Signal Transduction. Rows are clustered by node-pair parameter values (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Parameter variance is plotted above the heat map. Single-node parameters (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are consistently altered in SL regardless of function. However, node-pair parameters differ between functions. This distinction suggests that network substructure may dictate SL mechanisms associated with a specific function.</p>

<p>We then annotated each putative SL gene pair from these 17 functional categories for three possible mechanisms: (1) complex, where the proteins products of the pair are known to form a complex, (2) parallel, where the proteins function in the same pathway with no known direct or indirect interaction, and (3) other, for gene pairs that do not fit in (1) or (2). In total there were 5,249 putative SL gene pairs for the 17 categories. Most of these pairs were in the same complex (56.2%, N = 2,950), followed by parallel (24.0%, N = 1,260) and other (19.8%, N = 1,039). We tested each function category for enrichments for particular mechanisms of SL. We found that each function has different proportions of putative mechanistic annotations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig</xref>)</p>
<p>We found that immune system (OR = 1.48, p = 0.000001) and signal transduction (OR = 1.42, p = 0.000894) were significantly enriched for SL genes that function in parallel, after multiple hypothesis correction (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We found four categories were enriched for SL genes that were components in complexes: gene expression (OR = 1.38, p = 0.000298), meiosis (OR = 4.31, p = 0.046), chromatin organization (OR = 2.10, p = 0.008499), and DNA repair (OR = 4.76, p &lt; 2.2e-16) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Finally, we found that Cluster 1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), which includes transmembrane transport, metabolism, hemostasis, developmental biology, cell-cell communication, muscle contraction, and the immune system, is significantly enriched for SL genes that function in parallel (OR = 1.36, p = 0.00008).</p>

<p>We identified 58 unique genes from high-scoring gene pairs (SINaTRA≥0.85) where both members were targets of cancer therapies (68 unique drugs). These genes were clustered by SINaTRA score (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) using hierarchical clustering; areas of high (red) and low (blue) SINaTRA scores are easily be observed. We found that gene pairs that are targeted by drugs have significantly higher SINaTRA scores than those that are not; median SINaTRA score increases significantly from pairs that are targeted by only one drug (median score = 0.156), to those targeted by two drugs (median score = 0.166), to those targeted by only one cancer drug (median score = 0.211), to those targeted by two cancer drugs (median score = 0.283) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>A. Druggable gene pairs clustered by SINaTRA score.</title>
<p>Sixty-two unique genes that participated in predicted SL interactions with SINaTRA scores &gt;0.85, where both genes mapped to drugs in DCDB, were identified. All pairwise SINaTRA scores were computed and clustered by score. Areas of high- and low SINaTRA scores are clearly visible. B. All possible gene pairs identified in Part A were mapped to DCDB, and gene pairs whose products are targeted by single drugs and combination therapies in the clinical pipeline were highlighted (pre-clinical, blue; clinical trials, green; single drug, red; gene pairs filtered out by genetic analysis, gray; filtered gene pairs associated with drugs, black [n = 0]). Areas enriched for drug combinations were highlighted in both parts A and B. C. Enrichment of tested compounds in the four areas of interest were calculated using the Fisher Exact Test, and p-values were calculated. Areas 1, 2 and 4 were significantly enriched. D. Distributions of SINaTRA score by drug type.</p>

<p>Next, we identified which of these gene pairs were filtered out through our co-mutation analysis (gray), as well as those linked to single-drug therapies (red), drug combination therapies in the clinical pipeline (blue: preclinical; green: in clinical trials). These data were overlaid on the heat map (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). We found that gene pairs targeted by cancer drugs have significantly higher SINaTRA scores than filtered pairs and pairs not under investigation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>; U = 44,964, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test).</p>
<p>We also visually identified “hotspots” of drug combinations (black boxes, <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) that correspond to gene pairs with high SINaTRA scores (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). We found that Area 1 alone contains genes related to gene expression (p = 0.040), transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter (p = 0.025), and steroid hormone receptor activity (p = 0.025; Fisher’s exact test with multiple hypothesis testing). In addition, Area 2 is associated with protein autophosphorylation (OR = 39.1, p = 0.000613; Fisher’s exact test). Areas 3 and 4 are not significantly associated with any GO terms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we present a computational method, Species INdependent TRAnslation (SINaTRA), for predicting synthetic lethal (SL) relationships in any species with an available protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Our approach uses SL data from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>–the most well-characterized organism for this interaction–to train a statistical model that identifies network connectivity profiles indicative of synthetic lethality. Once trained, the model can be applied to any other species for which PPI data exist. The model takes the PPI network data as its input, and returns a probabilistic score between 0 and 1 for every pair that we deem the SINaTRA score. These scores represent the likelihood of an SL relationship between those two genes.</p>
<p>We validated our method by predicting which pairs are likely to be SL in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, another species for which a large number of SL pairs are known. Our approach significantly ourperforms others we tested. Most notably, our method does not rely on any knowledge of gene structure, sequence, or function; instead, it uses only the connectivity patterns exhibited by synthetic lethal pairs of genes as they appear in a protein-protein interaction network. Future work will focus on the integration of other sources of knowledge with the goal of improving predictive performance and understanding the role of connectivity under different functional conditions.</p>
<sec id="sec026">
<title>Previous interspecies methods of predicting synthetic lethality</title>
<p>Previous work on interspecies SL prediction has focused on the use of genetic homology.[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] We found that the method has fairly high predictive power between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> when considering only gene pairs with known homology (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Unfortunately, many genes have no known homology information and, because of this, the model performance suffers when considering all interspecies gene pairs. An additional complication stems from genes with multiple homologues, resulting in ambiguous predictions. In an effort to address some of these challenges with using established orthologs, we also implemented two additional methods: one using shared structural domains, and one derived from structural families. Neither method outperformed SINaTRA. The most successful comparison method was the number of shared functional annotations in the Gene Ontology (AUC = 0.81), which performed almost as well as SINaTRA (AUC = 0.86). We additionally found that the information contained in the functional annotations and SINaTRA was not redundant, suggesting that a model that combines connectivity profiles with functional annotations may yield better performance.</p>

<title>Connectivity homology as a novel method for predicting synthetic lethality</title>
<p>In this paper, we introduce the idea of <italic>connectivity homology</italic>, which exists when two genes share a similarity connectivity patterns quantified by network and graph theoretic parameters. We performed a small exploration of connectivity homology and its relation to genetic homology and function, and found that homologous genes and genes that share function exhibit higher connectivity homology (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that there are connectivity patterns between pairs of genes that are indicative of a synthetic lethal relationship. These patterns are discovered using supervised machine learning in a <italic>source</italic> species–one where synthetic lethality has been well-characterized–and then identify these patterns in a <italic>target</italic> species to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes. We performed a small exploration of connectivity homology and its relation to genetic homology and function, and found that homologous genes exhibit higher connectivity homology; in turn, interspecies gene pairs that share the same specific function have higher connectivity homology than interspecies gene pairs of different functions (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We validated our approach in two species where SL has been experimentally explored (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>). We found that our approach, called SINaTRA, significantly outperformed published methods at predicting SL genes in the target species and we achieve precision up to 150 times higher than expected by chance. This precision increased to over 250 times higher than chance when using additional biological priors.</p>

<title>Possible mechanisms of synthetic lethality</title>
<p>Several mechanisms of synthetic lethality have previously been proposed;[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] these include within complex, parallel pathways, and essential linear pathways. Hints regarding the mechanism driving a given gene pair may be provided by our connectivity parameters. Our data suggest that function-specific network substructures are different, and may be related to trends of SL mechanism within a function. For example, metabolism has a much higher proportion of ‘unknown’ pathway annotations than does apoptosis (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>). This suggests that putative metabolic SL pairs act through parallel pathways, while apoptotic pairs may act through within-complex mechanisms. Further, gene pairs in apoptotic pathways are farther apart and have lower communicability than gene pairs in metabolic pathways, which may also change how many SL pairs are likely to exist with that function.</p>
<p>We also observe that a fraction of the predicted SL pairs had between-pathway interactions, where members of an SL pair do not share any single function (<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The respective gene products may act at an interface between two related functions; the putative SL pair may be a false positive; or–most interestingly–one (or both) genes have previously unidentified functions that cause their SL behavior. One such example is the putative SL pair, BAIAP2 (insulin receptor signaling; UniProt DB) and ALDH7A1 (protection from oxidative stress; UniProt DB) (SINaTRA score: 0.957). Oxidative stress is associated with insulin resistance,[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and knocking out both of these genes may mimic or exacerbate insulin resistance, leading to complications and adverse events.</p>

<title>False positive rate in predictions of synthetic lethality</title>
<p>For very rare biological phenomena, it is essential to consider the false positive rate of any experimental or computational approach. An unbiased random selection of gene pairs would yield approximately 1 synthetic lethal pair for every 1,000 tested. If biased by biological priors, such as limiting the analysis to pairs of genes whose products are partners in protein complexes, this yield may increase 8-fold, to 1 out of every 125 pairs tested.</p>
<p>The SINaTRA score we present can also be used as a biological prior. In this case, it is the connectivity pattern of the pair of proteins that makes them more likely to participate in a synthetic lethal interaction. For example, a score of 0.85 or greater would yield approximately 1 SL for every 10 pairs tested. If this is coupled with protein complex prior, this could improve to 1 out of every 3 or 4 pairs tested. Combined with other biological priors, the SINaTRA score can be a powerful tool for directing experimental exploration of synthetic lethality. <xref rid="pcbi.1004506.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> illustrates this expected hit rate versus the number of experiments that would be necessary. These scores can be used to guide experimental exploration depending on the throughput and cost of the experimental approach.</p>

<title>Context-specific synthetic lethality</title>
<p>Biological contexts, such as tissue type and disease state, can influence synthetic lethal interactions.[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] At this time, cellular and tissue specificity are not captured by the SINaTRA model. However, we can customize our predictions for a given cell or tissue by pruning away any predicted genes that are known not to be expressed in the given context. We used the Protein Atlas[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to perform this customization and found that certain tissues and cell types had significantly more or fewer SL pairs filtered. These deviations may suggest tissue or cell types that are particularly robust, or susceptible, to SL interactions. For example, respiratory epithelial cells and endothelial cells have many more SL pairs filtered out than expected by chance; this suggests that the tissues are not as susceptible to SL reactions–a hypothesis that requires further investigation.</p>

<title>Predicted synthetic lethal pairs in humans inform cancer polypharmacology</title>
<p>For nearly a decade, leveraging synthetic lethal relationships specific to cancer cells has been a strategy in drug discovery. Therefore, we applied our predictions of synthetic lethality to the study of pharmacology. We found that many cancer combination therapies currently in the clinical pipeline target genes with high SINaTRA scores, suggesting that they use mechanisms of synthetic lethality as their modes of action. Clustering reveals hotspots of high SINaTRA scores that are significantly enriched for combination therapies under investigation. Importantly, our algorithm was able to identify these without any <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the drug combination. Gene pairs found in these hotspots that have not been previously investigated may be promising leads for novel polyphamacological treatments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec032">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our method for predicting SL relies on the availability of protein-protein interaction data. Due to the high-throughput experimental techniques, such as tandem affinity purification and yeast two-hybrid, these are some of the most widely available–omic data. However, comprehensive networks are only available for a handful of species. Future expansions of the approach will focus on integrating other available data, such as genetic sequence or gene expression. These other data sources may help address the issue of context-specificity in our predictions.</p>
<p>In this study, we used 12 distinct graph theoretic parameters to describe each gene pair. The choice of these parameters was based on what was available and has been used in prior work, and is not an exhaustive list. Other methods for computing connectivity may be incorporated in future versions of the algorithm, such as spectral methods.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, the methodology presented in this paper can help to inform a wide variety of studies in human health by fully utilizing information gathered in model species. In particular, the differential mechanistic analysis that highlights how biological functions may be targeted using synthetic lethality and the “hot spots” of drug synergy highlighted by our cancer therapy analysis indicate promising areas for novel therapeutics. We provide the SINaTRA scores for almost 110 million human gene pairs as a freely available resource for basic and translational science.</p>

<p>In order to create the homology-based model, we replicated a previous paper[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] that defined a gene pair as SL if its homologous pair in another species is SL. Gene pairs were defined as SL if the homologous pair in the source species was SL. In the case of multiple homologous pairs in the source species, gene pairs described by the fraction of homologous pairs defined as SL. A pair score &gt;0 resulted in a classification of SL. Homology-based models use only genes with known homologs between the two species of interest. Whole-genome, homology-based models are the union of all genes in the homologous dataset with all genes that appear in our protein-protein interaction network. Genes with no known homologs are given a feature value of 0.</p>
<p>Protein similarity was defined using values between 0 (no match) and 4 (same class) according to SCOP annotations. Functional similarity was defined using GO process and function terms, excluding “molecular_function” and “biological_process.” Gene pairs were assigned a value based on the number of overlapping GO terms assigned to each gene. Using PFam domain data, we used the size of PFam ID overlap (range: [0,8)) for within-species gene pairs. For SCOP-, GO-, and PFam-based models, we trained the logistic regression model on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and applied it to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>.

<title>Calculation of translated network parameters</title>
<p>Regular normalization of a parameter returns each value divided by the maximum value of that parameter, such that each value is between 0 and 1. To rank-normalize data for a given species, we calculated all individual single- and two-node parameters. Then, for each parameter, we ranked all calculated values from smallest to largest, resolving ties at random. We then divided all values by the total number of genes in the network (for single-node parameters) or the total number of gene pairs (for node-pair parameters). This resulted in all genes or gene pairs having all parameter values be a value between 0 and 1. Tied-rank normalization assigns the median rank to all equal values, then normalizes single-node parameters by the number of genes in the network, and node-pair parameters by the total number of pairs. Quantile normalization is described in previous work,[<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] where networks with fewer nodes/edges are up-sampled.

This cutoff was set to 100 at first, then expanded to cutoffs of 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500, and 750.</p>

<title>SINaTRA outperforms translation-free and non-network methods</title>
<p>Synthetic lethality is expected to occur in 1/1000 gene pairs in diploid organisms; therefore, the PPV expected by chance is 0.001. We calculated positive predictive value (PPV), the fraction of true positives out of all called positives, on all <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> gene pairs, and on all gene pairs in the same complex. We selected 1000X the number of NSL pairs as SL pairs and bootstrapped the 99% CI of the PPV for both untranslated and SINaTRA-based predictions. To calculate PPV at each cutoff C, gene pairs with SINaTRA ≥ C were considered to be SL, while pairs with SINaTRA &lt; C were considered NSL.</p>
<p>Complex membership was identified by using the Entrez GO database, and filtering all GO terms that contained the word “complex” and were in the “component” category. This amounted to 8,365 pairs, of which 5,806 appeared in our network. 46 of these were experimentally known SL pairs, leaving a ration of approximately 3:400 SL:NSL. We estimated that, because many SL pairs are unknown in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, the ratio of SL:NSL in within-complex pairs will be approximately 1:50, and selected SL:NSL pairs in a ratio of 1:50 in order to estimate within-complex PPV. This simulation was performed 1,000 times to identify the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile CI.</p>
<p>We additionally plotted the PPV of SL prediction using genetic homology, structural similarity, functional similarity, and information centrality. The expected PPV of all of these were calculated using SL:NSL gene pairs in ratios of 1:1000; because the cutoffs occurred in a range significantly smaller than [0,1], we selected the cutoff that would provide the optimal PPV for the given model (all pairs), then calculated the PPV when adjusting for SL:NSL ratio. The PPV of genetic homology was calculated using only <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> pairs that have homologs in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
<p>We identified the true and false positives and negatives for homology and whole-genome homology as follows: if the input score was &gt;0 and the target species pair was SL, it was a true positive; else it was a false positive. If the input score was 0 and the target species was NSL, it was a true negative; else, it was a false negative. In whole-genome models, all node pairs with no homology information for at least one node were given a score of 0. Odds ratios were calculated using confusion matrices of form [[TP,FP],[FN,TN]] and Fisher’s exact test.</p>
<p>For whole-genome SINaTRA methods, if the gene pair SINaTRA score ≥ given cutoff and the target species pair was SL, it was a true positive; else, it was a false positive. If the gene pair SINaTRA score &lt; given cutoff and the target species pair was NSL, it was a true negative; else, it was a true positive. In a whole-genome SINaTRA model, nodes that appeared in the Homologene database but not in the network were assigned SINaTRA scores of 0.</p>
<p>We identified the expected number of unidentified SL pairs in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> by taking the PPV at each SINaTRA cutoff and multiplying it by the number of putative hits at that cutoff.

<title>Putative synthetic lethal pairs are more likely to be in the same pathway</title>
<p>We identified all putative SL pairs with SINaTRA scores &gt;0.95, 0.90, and 0.80; these groups consisted of 1,224, 6,366, and 32,290 gene pairs, respectively. For all cutoffs, we mapped the genes to their respective pathways using the KEGG database. We compared the number of putative SL gene pairs with the same pathway to the number expected in a group of that size at random. Significance was assessed using the Fisher exact test.</p>

<title>Protein complexes are significantly enriched for putative synthetic lethal pairs</title>
<p>We identified all complexes from the CORUM mammalian protein complex database where all members of the complex mapped unambiguously to one Entrez gene ID. We then randomly selected 20 mutually exclusive complexes composed of five proteins each, and identified the SINaTRA scores for all pairwise combinations of the genes associated with these products. We plotted the SINaTRA scores as a heatmap. To test significance, we randomly selected the same number of inter-complex gene pairs as there were intra-complex gene pairs, and applied the Mann-Whitney U test.</p>
<p>We additionally investigated whether this trend of significance would hold for all protein complexes that were composed of ≤10 proteins from our filtered list, and for all protein complexes in our filtered list. Significance was tested using the same methodology and the Mann-Whitney U test.</p>

<title>Context-specific synthetic lethality</title>
<p>Protein expression data in tissues was downloaded from the Protein Atlas. ENS identification codes were mapped to Entrez gene IDs, and putative SL pairs at each SINaTRA cutoff were determined to be NSL in context if both proteins were not detected in the tissue of choice. We identified all gene pairs with SINaTRA≥0.85. For each tissue and cell line, we removed a gene pair from the context-specific SL pair list if both genes’ products were found not to be expressed in the given context. The SL pairs that were not filtered out by this method were considered the retained SL pairs. We calculated the number of expected retained gene pairs as follows:

<title>Comparison to previously published methods</title>
<p>SL predictions from the Syn-Lethality and DAISY papers were mapped to their Entrez gene terms, and we found the SINaTRA score of each pair. Significance compared to random SINaTRA pairs was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. We constructed classifiers for DAISY and Syn-Lethality using SINaTRA scores as the features and status in the given dataset as the class. We compared this with homology and functional similarity (GO).</p>
<p>We next tested the ability of three methods (SINaTRA, functional similarity, homology) to predict membership in the DAISY and Syn-Lethality datasets. Only pairs from the tested VHL predictions were used form DAISY. We selected an equal number of gene pairs belonging in the dataset (positive examples) and not in the dataset (negative examples), and identified the SINaTRA scores, homology-based SL status from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, and within-species functional similarity (discrete) score for each.

<title>The landscape of human synthetic lethality</title>
<p>In order to graphically explore the landscape of human synthetic lethality, we identified all gene pairs with SINaTRA scores ≥0.95. These were mapped to the Reactome database, using the highest terms in the hierarchy: apoptosis; binding and uptake of ligands by scavenger receptors; cell cycle; cell-cell communication; cellular response to stress; chromatin organization; circadian clock; developmental biology; disease; DNA repair; DNA replication; extracellular matrix organization; gene expression; hemostasis; membrane trafficking; metabolism; metabolism of proteins; muscle contraction; neuronal system; organelle biogenesis and maintenance; reproduction; signal transduction; and transmembrane transport of small molecules. Of the 1,229 gene pairs with SINaTRA scores ≥0.95, 458 existed where both members mapped to a Reactome label.</p>
<p>SL pairs were represented in pathway-specific networks visualized in Cytoscape, [<xref rid="pcbi.1004506.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] where both genes were part of the same pathway. Genes are nodes, and two nodes were connected if their SINaTRA score is ≥0.95. Nodes are colored by closeness centrality, and their size depends on node degree. Pathway-specific networks are designated by hexagons, which are joined to each other with edges weighted by the number of inter-pathway SL pairs that exist; that is, gene pairs with mutually exclusive pathway designations.</p>

<title>Function-specific mechanisms of synthetic lethality</title>
<p>We identified all gene pairs of the functions from the previous section, as well as an SL subset (SINaTRA score ≥0.85). We then calculated the median value of all node-pair and single-node parameters and plotted a heat map of the ratio of SL to all gene parameters. Because of the low variance between single-node parameters, we clustered each function by the node-pair parameters.</p>
<p>We next annotated all SL pairs with Reactome pathways into three groups: complex, parallel, and other. Two genes were annotated with “complex” if their protein products were known to participate in a protein complex together. Two genes were annotated with “parallel” if they had the same functional annotation but no direct interaction according to Reactome. Finally, two genes were annotated as other if they did not fit these either the “complex” or “parallel” definitions. For each functional category we tested if the gene pairs were enriched for parallel or complex annotations using a Fisher’s exact test.</p>

<title>Putative human synthetic lethal pairs are predictive of investigative cancer therapy</title>
<p>Using the aforementioned list of genes, we identified the SINaTRA score for all pairwise combinations of genes. We plotted these as a heat map, clustering the rows and columns by SINaTRA score. We then identified all known single-drug and cancer combination therapies in experimental and clinical pipelines using DCDB, and overlaid these data on the clustered heat map to visually identify clusters of therapies and their correspondence to SINaTRA score. We additionally identified which pairs of genes were filtered out using our co-mutation analysis, and confirmed that no gene pairs that were filtered out were also targets of cancer drugs. We performed a Mann-Whitney U test on distributions of SINaTRA scores for non-tested and filtered gene pairs vs. gene pairs associated with drugs, vs. single-drug gene pairs, vs. drug combinations in preclinical testing, and vs. drug combinations in clinical testing.</p>
