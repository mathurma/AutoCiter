<abstract>
<p>Beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a particularly appealing target for therapeutics in the treatment of metabolic diseases through norepinephrine (NE)-mediated signaling pathways. Although previous studies report NE clearance mechanisms via SLC6A2 on sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues (ATs), the low catecholamine clearance capacity of SLC6A2 may limit the cleaning efficiency. Here, we report that mouse organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3; Slc22a3) is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes, which differs from other known routes such as adjacent neurons or macrophages. We further show that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes <italic>Maoa</italic>, <italic>Maob</italic>, and <italic>Comt</italic>, providing the molecular basis on NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. Under NE administration, ablation of <italic>Oct3</italic> induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared with littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal WAT (ingWAT) in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic>-deficient mice shows much stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than in littermate controls, and this response involves enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb) pathway activation. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to significantly higher levels to compensate for the loss of ATP production in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> knockout (KO) mice, indicating the fundamental role of glucose metabolism during beiging. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolishes the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in <italic>Oct3-</italic>deficient ingWAT, indicating the NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO adipocytes. Of note, reduced functional alleles in human <italic>OCT3</italic> are also identified to be associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Collectively, our results demonstrate that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Adipose tissues (ATs) can be divided into three distinct types: white fat (or white AT [WAT]), brown fat, and beige fat. Growing evidence suggests that the development of beige fat cells in WAT, also called browning or beiging of WAT, might protect against obesity and improve systemic metabolism. Norepinephrine (NE)-induced β-adrenergic signaling is a major regulator of adaptive thermogenesis (a process of generating heat under conditions of physical activity) and leads to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb), thereby controlling the expression of thermogenic genes. In this study, we found that the catecholamine transporter, mouse organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3), is highly expressed in WAT, where it mediates NE uptake in the white fat cells in vivo and in vitro. Removing Oct3 in the fat cells leads to enhanced lipid breakdown, increased thermogenesis, and browning of WAT when stimulated by NE or cold exposure via activation of the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/PKA/Creb pathway. In humans, reduced functional alleles of <italic>OCT3</italic> are also associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Our results indicate that Oct3 is an essential regulator of NE recycling and the beiging of WAT.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity, a disease characterized by excess body fat, is a major risk factor for many human diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref001">1</xref>]. In mammals, fat is stored primarily in adipose tissue (AT), and three distinct types of ATs have been characterized: white AT (WAT), brown AT (BAT), and beige AT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref002">2</xref>]. The morphology, function, cellular origins, and molecular features of the three types of ATs are quite distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref003">3</xref>]. WAT stores nutrients as triglycerides in unilocular adipocytes, which can be used to generate free fatty acids (FFAs) by lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref004">4</xref>]. BAT is the main tissue responsible for thermogenesis, especially when stimulated by cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref005">5</xref>]. After prolonged thermogenic induction, brown-like adipocytes can also be found in WAT, thus named beige or brite adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref003">3</xref>]. The heat produced by BAT or beige AT is indispensable for survival during cold acclimatization. Also, the adaptive thermogenic beige AT may have the potential to counteract obesity and its related disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Beiging of WAT can be induced by various stimuli, including cold challenge, bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref009">9</xref>], pharmacological agents, and hormones such as norepinephrine (NE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref010">10</xref>]. NE activates β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR), which is coupled to G-proteins, resulting in increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration in adipocytes that enhance the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref011">11</xref>]. This signal not only leads to lipolysis by phosphorylating hormone sensitive lipase (Hsl) but also by phosphorylating cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), subsequently increasing the expression levels of thermogenic genes (<italic>UCP1</italic>, <italic>PGC1α</italic>, and <italic>DIO2</italic>) to promote nonshivering thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref012">12</xref>]. The tightly regulated dichotomy of NE release and clearance maintains the balance between NE-induced thermogenesis and excessive NE in the vicinity of adipocytes. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the mechanism of NE clearance in AT. Although previous studies reported NE clearance mechanisms via SLC6A2 on sympathetic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref013">13</xref>] or proinflammatory macrophages in AT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref015">15</xref>], the low catecholamine clearance capacity of SLC6A2 may limit its cleaning efficiency.</p>
<p>Catecholamines, including NE, epinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, act as neuromodulators in the central nervous system and as hormones in ATs and blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref016">16</xref>]. Catecholamines are actively cleared in extracellular environment and are translocated into cells by specialized transporters that belong to two distinct transport mechanisms: neuronal transport (Uptake<sub>1</sub>, which is mediated by SLC6A2, SLC6A3, and SLC6A4) and extraneuronal transport (Uptake<sub>2</sub>, which is mediated by organic cation transporters [OCTs]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref017">17</xref>]. Studies have suggested a role of AT in the clearance and metabolism of catecholamines. Indeed, it has been shown that plasma concentrations of epinephrine and NE decrease after passing through AT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, human adipocytes exhibit high expression levels and enzymatic activity of the catecholamine-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref020">20</xref>]. Transport of catecholamines by adipocytes displays similar characteristics as the Uptake<sub>2</sub> system and can be inhibited by the OCT3 inhibitor disprocynium 24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref020">20</xref>]. Ayala-Lopez et al. identified that perivascular ATs in male Sprague-Dawley rats had a NE uptake mechanism and could be reduced by norepinephrine transporter (NET) or/and OCT3 inhibitors ex vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref021">21</xref>]. We reason that extraneuronal monoamine transporter OCT3 is an important route in NE clearance and adaptive thermogenesis in adipocytes complementary to sympathetic neurons or macrophages. In addition, the <italic>SLC22A3</italic> (<italic>OCT3</italic>)<italic>-LPAL2-LPA</italic> gene cluster has been identified as a risk locus for coronary artery disease, implying its potential relationship to lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we identified Oct3 as a novel non-neural NE clearance route in adipocytes and demonstrated its role in governing β-AR activity to mediate the beiging of WAT. Adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> knockout (KO) mice under cold acclimatization or NE administration exhibited significantly higher expression levels of genes related to thermogenesis, mitochondria biogenesis, and glycolysis in inguinal WAT (ingWAT) compared with <italic>Oct3</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> (Ctrl) mice. Of note, through mining of the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Catalog, the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP), and UK BioBank databases, we also identified genetic variants of human <italic>OCT3</italic> associated with higher basal metabolic rate (BMR). These findings suggest that Oct3 regulates catecholamines levels in the vicinity of the β-AR in adipocytes and therefore plays essential roles in the browning of WAT during adaptive thermogenesis. Inhibition of OCT3 may provide distinct therapeutic application by activating energy expenditure pathways.</p>

<p>To compare the Oct3 uptake activity against its main substrates (NE, serotonin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>), epinephrine, dopamine, and tyramine), substrate uptake assays were performed in HEK-293 Flp-In cells stably expressing <italic>Oct3</italic>. NE had the highest uptake activity when cells were incubated with equivalent concentrations of catecholamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Human OCT3 and mouse Oct3-overexpressing HEK-293 cells both showed strong NE transport activities compared with empty vector (EV) in vitro, with <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> of 0.182 ± 0.0275 mM, 3.57 ± 0.174 nmol/mg protein/min (human) and 0.336 ± 0.0726 mM, 5.77 ± 0.448 nmol/mg protein/min (mouse), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Both <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> of OCT3 were more than 600 times greater than previously reported values of the Uptake<sub>1</sub> transporter, SLC6A2 (0.28 ± 0.03 μM; 5.83 ± 0.49 pmol/mg protein/min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref023">23</xref>], consistent with OCT3 being a high-capacity, low-affinity Uptake<sub>2</sub> transporter of NE. These data suggested an important role of OCT3 in regulating NE concentrations in peripheral tissues including AT, especially when a high concentration of NE existed, such as under NE stimulation or cold challenge.</p>
<p>To further examine the interactions between catecholamines and Oct3, we built a three-dimensional Oct3 homology model based on human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) template. Docking of structurally divergent catecholamines (NE, epinephrine, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine) indicated that epinephrine (E = −45.7) and NE (E = −43.6) showed the best docking energy scores, resulting from favorable interactions formed between these two bioamines and polar residues in the primary substrate binding site of Oct3 including K215, Q242, E385, and E446 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s001">S1E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the connection between Oct3, catecholamines, and adipocyte metabolism in vivo, we crossed Oct3<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with Adiponectin-Cre mice to conditionally delete <italic>Oct3</italic> in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Disruption of <italic>Oct3</italic> was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) and western blot analysis in ATs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). In addition, no compensational changes were observed in expression levels of the other catecholamine transporters <italic>Slc6a2</italic>, <italic>Slc6a3</italic>, and <italic>Slc6a4</italic> in <italic>Oct3</italic>-deficient ATs compared with controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). When fed a normal chow diet, adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice were healthy and viable, with no significant differences in body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s002">S2D Fig</xref>), metabolic parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s002">S2E–S2H Fig</xref>), or adipose morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s002">S2I Fig</xref>) compared with Ctrl mice under room temperature (RT).</p>
<p>To determine NE uptake activity in different adipocytes, we performed [<sup>3</sup>H]-NE uptake assays in primary white and brown adipocytes. When treated with NE at a physiologically relevant concentration (0.20 μM), NE accumulation was significantly reduced (80% reduction) in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO white adipocytes compared with controls, but not in brown adipocytes, suggesting that Oct3 is required for NE uptake in white adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Moreover, in vivo NE uptake assay was performed after chemical sympathectomy, which eliminated neural NE uptake in ingWAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). <italic>Oct3</italic>-null WAT showed significantly reduced total radioactivity, which reflected the accumulation of NE and its metabolites in adipocytes (73% and 65% reduction in ingWAT and gonWAT, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g001">Fig 1J</xref>). Both the in vitro and in vivo data supported the role of Oct3 as the NE transporter in WAT.</p>

<title>Ablation of <italic>Oct3</italic> enhanced catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis and β-adrenergic signaling in WAT</title>
<p>Activation of β-AR signaling has been found to promote lipolysis via the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Hsl.

Although <italic>Oct3</italic> overexpression did not significantly affect adipocyte differentiation based on Oil Red O staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s004">S4D Fig</xref>) or measurement of basal lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), <italic>Oct3</italic>-OE cells displayed attenuated NE-stimulated lipolysis compared with EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), likely a result of enhanced NE transport to adipocytes accompanied by reduction of extracellular NE. In addition, <italic>Oct3</italic>-OE and EV cells were treated with the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin (10 μM), and similar lipolytic capacities were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s004">S4E Fig</xref>), indicating that cAMP signaling (blocked by forskolin) and downstream lipolytic capacity were not primary causes of the difference in NE-stimulated lipolysis in our model.</p>
<p>In light of the enhanced lipolysis in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO AT after NE stimulation, we examined the effect of adipose-specific KO of <italic>Oct3</italic> on the liver. Fatty liver was not observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s004">S4F Fig</xref>), and there was no significant difference in liver triglyceride levels between genotypes 4 hours after NE injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s004">S4G Fig</xref>). One possible reason was that single NE injection represented only a short-term effect on lipolysis and FFA flux in blood, and another was that the 4-hour duration time might be insufficient to generate significant differences in fat accumulation in the liver.</p>

<title><italic>Oct3</italic> deficiency induced white to brown fat transition and enhanced thermogenesis</title>
<p>To study the role of <italic>Oct3</italic> in physiologically stimulated thermogenesis, adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO and Ctrl mice were exposed to a 4°C ambient environment for 1 month. Both groups had similar rectal temperatures under RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice showed significantly higher rectal temperatures (by 1.7°C) than those of Ctrl littermates after prolonged cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5A Fig</xref>, body weight of adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice had a slight but significant decrease compared with that of Ctrl mice after sustained cold exposure. We also observed a more reddish appearance of ingWAT in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice compared with Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Notably, adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT contained more clusters of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1)-positive multilocular adipocytes than Ctrl after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Whole-body energy expenditure of mice after cold challenge was measured by Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS). Adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice showed markedly higher O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates (OCRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), CO<sub>2</sub> production rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), and heat production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4G</xref>) than Ctrl, indicating a higher BMR. In addition, higher NE levels were observed in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), probably due to accumulation of extracellular NE derived from sympathetic nerve endings during cold challenge. Meanwhile, NE concentration in serum was also slightly increased, probably due to a leakage of extracellular NE in WAT into blood circulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). These results showed the role of Oct3 in altering NE distribution between adipocytes and blood circulation.</p>

<p>In order to examine global gene expression changes in ingWAT, RNA from ingWAT of both genotypes were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Ablation of <italic>Oct3</italic> led to significantly differential expression of 2,521 genes in ingWAT (adjusted <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s012">S1 Table</xref>). Widespread up-regulation of BAT-selective and beige genes were identified in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4H</xref>), while WAT-selective genes showed a down-regulation tendency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). Furthermore, expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) also showed substantial up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Based on the RNA-seq data analysis, we conducted real-time PCR analysis on genes involved in thermogenesis and adipose physiology. <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT from cold-exposed mice had significantly higher mRNA expression levels of thermogenic genes <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Pgc1α</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Pparα</italic>, <italic>Pgc1β</italic>, <italic>Tmem26</italic>, and <italic>Slc27a2</italic>—as well as genes that showed an up-regulation trend, including <italic>Tbx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4H</xref>)<italic>—</italic>whereas WAT-selective genes <italic>Gsn</italic>, <italic>Sncg</italic>, <italic>and Rarres2</italic> were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4I</xref>).

Moreover, a negative regulator of FAO, <italic>Twist1</italic>, was significantly reduced in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT, by 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). No significant changes in morphology of BAT and gonWAT from both genotypes were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5E Fig</xref>), consistent with unchanged mRNA levels of <italic>Pgc1α</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, and other thermogenesis genes, as well as representative FAO genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5F and S5G Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the close relationships between Oct3, NE, and thermogenesis, we next focused on the NE/β-AR/cAMP pathway. Western blot analysis showed that phospho-PKA (pPKA) substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4K</xref>), phospho-Creb (pCreb), and downstream Ucp1 and Pgc1α levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4L</xref>) were significantly elevated in ingWAT from adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice compared with Ctrl. Protein levels of pCreb, Ucp1, and Pgc1α remained unchanged in BAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5H Fig</xref>) and gonWAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5I Fig</xref>). Moreover, genes encoding components of the cAMP/PKA pathway (<italic>Adcy3</italic> and <italic>Adcy10</italic>) were also up-regulated in ingWAT after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s005">S5J Fig</xref>). Based on the data above, we hypothesized that the enhanced browning effect in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice during cold challenge may be due to higher metabolic rate and elevated thermogenic gene expression.</p>

<p>In ingWAT of adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice, the increase in cold-induced thermogenesis was coupled with broad up-regulation of electron transport chain (ETC) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). Real-time PCR analysis showed that expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes genes (<italic>Cox7b</italic>, <italic>Uqcrb</italic>, <italic>Uqcrh</italic>, and <italic>Cytochrome c</italic>) were remarkably increased in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT compared with Ctrl under cold stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g005">Fig 5I</xref>). In line with these changes, western blot analysis showed that protein levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7b (Cox7b), Uqcrb, Uqcrh, and Cytochrome c were significantly elevated in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT from mice under cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g005">Fig 5J</xref>).

<p>The profound differences of glycolytic genes in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO ingWAT suggested that <italic>Oct3</italic> deletion resulted in a metabolic rewiring during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g005">Fig 5K</xref>).

<p>Collectively, our results suggested that the elevated browning effect in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice may be owing to increased energy expenditure, mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhanced glycolysis in ingWAT.</p>

<p>To estimate the functional relevance of Oct3 for thermogenic capacity of adipocytes, we performed plate-based respirometry on primary adipocytes from preadipocytes isolated from SVC of ingWAT, which maintained expression of beige-related genes. Although the OCR curves were nearly identical in primary adipocytes of both genotypes in the absence of NE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s006">S6A Fig</xref>), <italic>Oct3</italic> KO beige adipocytes displayed a higher OCR than that of Ctrl cells after NE stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of β-AR by propranolol significantly blunted the NE-stimulated OCR increase to a similar extent in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Primary adipocytes derived from ingWAT were treated with NE and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) to induce <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref026">26</xref>]. An approximate 1.9-fold increase in <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO beige adipocytes was found even in the absence of NE compared with Ctrl, and another 3.7-fold increase occurred in response to NE treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Meanwhile, acute propranolol-induced inhibition of β-AR similarly blunted the NE-induced increase in <italic>Ucp1</italic> transcripts in the beige both groups of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). As a control, no noticeable difference was observed in mRNA expression of the NE-insensitive gene <italic>Ap2</italic> between groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Ucp1</italic> transcripts and Creb phosphorylation showed no response to treatment of other Oct3 substrates (epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As NE was known to activate β-AR and trigger PKA-Creb signaling, we examined whether the enhanced thermogenesis in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO beige adipocytes was regulated by the PKA/Creb pathway. NE-stimulated <italic>Oct3</italic> KO adipocytes showed robust phosphorylation of PKA substrates and Creb, without changes in total Creb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Meanwhile, these effects were largely eliminated by blockade of β-AR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), indicating that β-AR signaling was required for enhanced thermogenic activity under <italic>Oct3</italic> deficiency.</p>
<p>We next aimed to determine the requirement of NE/β-AR pathway in lipolysis induced by <italic>Oct3</italic> ablation. Propranolol at 10 μM partially but significantly inhibited the enhancing effect of NE on lipolysis and Hsl phosphorylation, while 100 μM propranolol showed complete inhibition in <italic>Oct3</italic> KO adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>), indicating that this effect relied on β-AR function.</p>
<p>Based on these collective results, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). Oct3 locates to cell membranes of adipocytes and uptakes NE, which thereby decreases NE concentration in AT microenvironments. <italic>Oct3</italic> deficiency reduces clearance of extracellular NE, subsequently increasing extracellular NE concentration and leading to enhanced lipolysis, glycolysis, thermogenesis, and WAT browning via β-AR/cAMP/PKA pathway activation.</p>

Meanwhile, serum FFAs increased about 21% during cold stimulation in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s007">S7K Fig</xref>), implying higher lipolysis owing to lower NE clearance under Oct3 deficiency.

<title>Human <italic>OCT3</italic> polymorphisms were associated with BMR</title>
<p>To determine the relevance of the studies in mice to human, BMR with polymorphisms within the human <italic>OCT3</italic> locus was explored through mining of GWAS Catalog, dbGAP, and UK BioBank databases. Among the 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <italic>OCT3</italic> locus, four independent SNPs were associated with BMR with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s008">S8A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s011">S3 Table</xref>). From the GTEx Portal, we noted that 10 of the 11 SNPs are significantly associated with human <italic>OCT3</italic> expression levels in ATs (subcutaneous and/or visceral omentum) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s008">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>). Each of the alleles, which was associated with lower expression levels of <italic>OCT3</italic> in AT, was correlated with higher BMR in the UK Biobank participants.</p>
<p>To further confirm the relevance to humans of the studies in mice, we performed experiments on human AT and primary human AT-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs) that were induced to differentiate into adipocytes. Both human AT and differentiated ATMSCs showed high expression levels of OCT3 and NE-degrading enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s008">S8D–S8F Fig</xref>). These results were consistent with studies on human adipocytes showing that NE uptake existed and was inhibited by OCT3 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, inhibition of OCT3 led to an increased lipolytic response to NE in differentiated ATMSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s008">S8G Fig</xref>), similar to the observations in mouse stromal vascular fraction (SVF)-derived adipocyte model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Although human functional genomic data and cell studies provided cues for metabolic roles of OCT3, further investigations are needed to define the subtle roles of human OCT3 in AT.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Brown and beige AT are two key drivers for the dissipation of chemical energy to stimulate thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref027">27</xref>]. The current study demonstrates that genetic deletion of <italic>Oct3</italic> enhances ingWAT beiging and up-regulates NE-induced thermogenesis, lipolysis, and mitochondria biogenesis by attenuating NE clearance. These findings support the non-neural role of Oct3 as a catecholamine scavenger for beige AT microenvironments in adaptive thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Recent studies have proposed a neural mechanism for NE uptake by Slc6a2 in special macrophages in AT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref015">15</xref>]. However, a proinflammatory state seems necessary to enhance their NE uptake in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, considering the high-affinity, low-capacity nature of Slc6a2 (K<sub>m</sub>: 0.28 ± 0.03 μM; V<sub>max</sub>: 5.83 ± 0.49 pmol/mg protein/min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref023">23</xref>], a NE transport system with greater transport capacity may be needed to meet increased metabolic demand during long-term cold challenge. With high expression in adipocytes and high capacity for catecholamines, Oct3 (K<sub>m</sub>: 0.183 ± 0.0275 mM; V<sub>max</sub>: 3.57 ± 0.174 nmol/mg protein/min) may function in part to clear catecholamines in white AT microenvironments. However, the quantitative contribution and exact conditions of extraneuronal NE uptake through Oct3 versus neuronal NE clearance remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Cold challenge induces stronger browning and NE/β-AR/PKA signaling in ingWAT of adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice. Consistent with sustained action of catecholamines, protein levels of pPKA substrate, pCreb, and downstream <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Pgc1α</italic> are all up-regulated. Pgc1α is the crucial transcriptional co-activator that is highly induced after cold exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref028">28</xref>]. In white adipocytes, ectopic expression of Pgc1α induces <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression and essential enzymes in mitochondria ETC and also increases mitochondrial DNA content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref029">29</xref>]. Mitochondria biogenesis and expression of ETC is significantly increased in ingWAT of adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice after cold challenge, which may result from elevated Pgc1α protein expression. Moreover, genes encoding fatty acid β-oxidation were exclusively up-regulated in ingWAT of <italic>Oct3</italic>-deficient mice after cold exposure. Consequently, more FFAs may be utilized as the primary fuel source for thermogenesis through Ucp1. These chain reactions are likely driven by more NE available due to <italic>Oct3</italic> deletion.</p>
<p>During browning of ingWAT in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice, metabolic rewiring of glucose metabolism to glycolysis is another significant phenomenon observed. Upon cold exposure, key enzymes in glycolysis and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (<italic>Pdk4</italic>, the key regulatory enzyme linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle) are significantly up-regulated in ingWAT of adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice. Higher expression of <italic>Pdk4</italic> restricts the conversion of glucose to acetyl-CoA and reprograms it towards a higher glycolytic metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref030">30</xref>]. Along with other key glycolytic enzymes, the enhanced glycolysis in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice may compensate for the loss of mitochondrial ATP production due to heat-generating mitochondrial uncoupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref031">31</xref>]. Recent reports have demonstrated that expression of glycolytic genes and <italic>Pdk4</italic> are induced by β-AR agonists in BAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref032">32</xref>]. The enhanced glycolytic activity in ingWAT of cold-exposed adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice most likely results from stronger adrenergic stimulation through blunted NE catabolism by Oct3 deficiency. To date, there is little information available regarding the role of glucose metabolism in WAT. RNA-seq data also showed that these glycolytic genes are more highly expressed in ingWAT in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s009">S1 Table</xref>). These findings revealed that Oct3-mediated glucose metabolism is important to WAT energy homeostasis.</p>
<p>The differential responsiveness of WAT and BAT in adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice may result from several factors. First, <italic>Oct3</italic> has a much lower expression in BAT compared with WAT. Second, current studies suggest that BAT is more densely innervated compared with WAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref033">33</xref>], and neuronal <italic>Slc6a2</italic> may be largely responsible for the clearance of catecholamines released in BAT after NE injection or cold exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref034">34</xref>]. Although browning of WAT can lead to metabolic improvements, the marked increase in energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g004">Fig 4E–4G</xref>) may also come from other sources such as skeletal muscle, cardiac and respiratory work, and liver, stimulated by enhanced circulating NE level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref032">32</xref>]. Under HFD treatment at RT or thermoneutrality, similar body weights between two genotypes are observed. It is probably due to drastically reduced density of sympathetic nerves in ingWAT under HFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref035">35</xref>]. On the other hand, the Uptake<sub>1</sub> system might be sufficient to compensate for the KO effect of <italic>Oct3</italic>. The overall proposed mechanism for Oct3 effects on WAT browning is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006571.g006">Fig 6I</xref>.</p>
<p>Exploration of the Gene Atlas database for genetic associations of human BMR with variants in <italic>OCT3</italic> shows consistency with some of the results in the adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mouse model. In particular, several reduced expression variants of OCT3 are positively correlated with BMR in human. Though a greater baseline BMR is not observed in the adipose-specific <italic>Oct3</italic> KO mice, metabolic rate is greater after either NE administration or cold challenge. Our study suggests an important clinical implication as β<sub>3</sub>-AR plays a central role in regulating nonshivering thermogenesis, which enhances energy expenditure and has potential to treat obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref036">36</xref>]. Inhibition of OCT3 might block NE transport into adipocytes and mimic β<sub>3</sub>-AR agonists, resulting in browning of WAT and enhanced lipolysis. In summary, our results demonstrate that Oct3 is essential in catecholamine clearance in adipocytes of WAT and blunts intracellular responses upon sustained catecholamine stimulation by regulating the activity of β-AR. Development of OCT3-specific inhibitors may shed light on improving metabolic disorders.</p>

The resources included GWAS Catalog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/home" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/home</ext-link>), dbGAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap</ext-link>), and UK BioBank resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneatlas.roslin.ed.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">http://geneatlas.roslin.ed.ac.uk/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/18/176834" xlink:type="simple">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/18/176834</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In Gene Atlas, which housed the results of all the genetic association studies analyses of the UK Biobank cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 408,455), BMR was available for over 7,000 participants. HaploReg version 4.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref057">57</xref>] and GTEx Portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref058">58</xref>] were used to determine the location, consequence of the variants, and the effect of the variants on transcript levels of the gene. Information about the methods used for determining BMR of the participants were available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/Anthropometry.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/Anthropometry.pdf</ext-link>).</p>

<title>HFD treatment</title>
<p>Six-week-old adipose-specific Oct3 KO and Ctrl mice were treated with HFD for 12 weeks under RT or thermoneutrality (30°C). For the groups under thermoneutrality, mice were then cold-stimulated at 4°C for 7 days. Body temperatures of mice were monitored at the first 8 hours under cold exposure. Body weights were recorded before and after cold exposure. Food intake was recorded daily during cold exposure. Blood was collected into EDTA tubes, and plasma was separated by centrifugation. Plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were determined by respective assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Biotechnology Institute, Nanjing, China). Commercially available ELISA kits were used to measure plasma adiponectin (Abcam), insulin (ALPCO, Salem, NH), serum and tissue NE (Rocky Mountain Diagnostics, Colorado Springs, CO) levels following instructions from the manufacturers. Plasma FFAs was measured NEFA C kits (Wako, Oxoid SA, France). Liver triglyceride content was measured using Triglyceride Quantification Assay Kit (Abcam).</p>

<sec id="sec030">
<title>Oral glucose tolerance test</title>
<p>Oral glucose tolerance test was performed on mice fed with 12-week HFD under thermoneutrality and then acclimated cold exposure for 7 days by oral gavage of glucose (2 g/kg) after 12-hour overnight fasting.</p>

<sec id="sec031">
<title>ATMSCs</title>
<p>Human MSCs derived from human AT, a kind gift from Dr. Yanan Du (Tsinghua University), were cultured in human MSC growth medium (Wuhan Viraltherapy Technologies Co. Ltd, Beijing) containing 10% calf serum and penicillin G. Adipogenic differentiation of human MSCs were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006571.ref059">59</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec032">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism" xlink:type="simple">http://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism</ext-link>). ANCOVA was conducted for in vivo metabolic data. Other analysis was conducted by Student <italic>t</italic> test (for comparison of two experimental conditions) or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (for comparison of three or more experimental conditions). Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance was calculated and indicated (*<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

(E) Three-dimensional–structure modeling of Oct3 and molecular docking of different monoamines. The three-dimensional Oct3 homology model was based on human GLUT3 template in the outward-facing-occluded (“occluded”) conformation in complex with D-glucose. The predicted homology models contained the whole target sequence including the 12 transmembrane helices and the primary substrate binding site. After overall structural quality evaluation with DOPE scores, the best-scored model was further assessed based on its ability to discriminate between catecholamines (NE, epinephrine, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine) and d-AMPH, which was not a substrate for Oct3 and only exerted weak inhibitory effects on Oct3-mediated uptake.

<title>Polymorphisms in human <italic>SLC22A3</italic> and their associations with BMR and transcript levels.</title>
<p>(A) A regional plot of <italic>SLC22A3</italic> locus. SNPs were plotted by chromosome 6 against association with BMR in UK Biobank participants (<italic>N</italic> ~ 7,000). An SNP, rs555754 (purple circle), and its proxies are the top signals in <italic>SLC22A3</italic> locus. Estimated recombination rates (cM/Mb) were plotted in blue to reflect the local LD structure. The SNPs surrounding the significant SNP, rs555754, were color coded to reflect their LD with this SNP. This LD was taken from pairwise r<sup>2</sup> values from the 1000 Genomes Nov 2014 EUR (hg19). Genes, the position of exons, and the direction of the transcription from the UCSC Genome Browser were noted. This plot was created using LocusZoom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://locuszoom.org/genform.php?type=yourdata" xlink:type="simple">http://locuszoom.org/genform.php?type=yourdata</ext-link>). The associations for each variant in this plot (effect size of the reference allele and <italic>p</italic>-value) were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s011">S3 Table</xref>. (B, C) <italic>SLC22A3</italic> transcript levels in adipose subcutaneous (panel B) and adipose visceral omentum (panel C) were significantly associated with the top two SNPs in the locus zoom plot in panel A. The figure and data were available in GTEx portal (gtexportal.org). The x-axis showed the genotype for the SNP and the y-axis showed the expression levels of <italic>SLC22A3</italic> as quantified by RNA-seq method. A full list of all eQTL for each SNPs were available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006571.s011">S3 Table</xref>.
