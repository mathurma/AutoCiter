<abstract>
<p>In the current era of malaria eradication, reducing transmission is critical. Assessment of transmissibility requires tools that can accurately identify the various developmental stages of the malaria parasite, particularly those required for transmission (sexual stages). Here, we present a method for estimating relative amounts of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> asexual and sexual stages from gene expression measurements. These are modeled using constrained linear regression to characterize stage-specific expression profiles within mixed-stage populations. The resulting profiles were analyzed functionally by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), confirming differentially active pathways such as increased mitochondrial activity and lipid metabolism during sexual development. We validated model predictions both from microarrays and from quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) measurements, based on the expression of a small set of key transcriptional markers. This sufficient marker set was identified by backward selection from the whole genome as available from expression arrays, targeting one sentinel marker per stage. The model as learned can be applied to any new microarray or qRT-PCR transcriptional measurement. We illustrate its use <italic>in vitro</italic> in inferring changes in stage distribution following stress and drug treatment and <italic>in vivo</italic> in identifying immature and mature sexual stage carriers within patient cohorts. We believe this approach will be a valuable resource for staging lab and field samples alike and will have wide applicability in epidemiological studies of malaria transmission.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The human malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is transmitted through a mosquito vector and causes over half a million deaths per year. The microorganism cycles through asexual and sexual life cycle stages, and its successful transmission relies on cells in the sexual stage. These stages are, however, present only at low levels during infection; most infecting cells are asexually reproduced. It can be challenging to assign biomolecular activity to particular parasite life cycle stages from typical gene expression profiles, given the mixed stage composition of most samples. We developed a deconvolution model to identify components of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transcriptional activity contributed by sexual and asexual life cycle stages, initially using samples of known composition. From these, we optimized a small set of stage-specific genes with highly informative expression patterns and trained an inference model to predict the stage composition of new samples. The model successfully inferred the parasite's transition from asexual to sexual development over time under laboratory conditions and identified a subset of patient samples harboring transmissible sexual stages. The system presented here can aid in epidemiological or laboratory perturbation in which stage composition is an important step in understanding and preventing malaria transmission.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the tenets of the recently released Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) is the development of new diagnostics specifically addressing transmission reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Alonso1">[1]</xref>. Individuals harboring the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transmissible parasite stage, or gametocyte, are the primary reservoir for malaria transmission, and thus proper surveillance of gametocyte carriers is critical to transmission reduction. Surveillance is difficult, however, because gametocytes comprise only a small fraction of the total body parasite load during active infection and are only observed in the bloodstream in their mature form, while developing stages are sequestered in tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Alano1">[2]</xref>. For these reasons, quantifying gametocytes in mixed parasite populations has been an ongoing challenge ever since they were first identified more than a century ago.</p>
<p>Gametocytes do execute substantially different transcriptional programs from asexual parasite stages, however, as has been well-studied <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Young1">[3]</xref>. Like the sequential dynamics of the asexual <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Bozdech1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-LeRoch1">[5]</xref>, gametocytes develop in a staged progression from immature (young and intermediate stages) to mature transmission-competent cells in preparation for meiosis and further development in the mosquito vector. The switch between asexual replication and sexual development does not occur ubiquitously <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, as even the most synchronized gametocyte induction protocols result in partially asynchronous and mixed gametocyte stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Young1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Eksi1">[6]</xref>. This problem is compounded <italic>in vivo</italic>, as blood sampled during infection is likely to contain both gametocyte and asexual parasite populations, leading to a highly convolved transcriptional mixture.</p>
<p>In addition to the need to dissect these signatures for analysis of microarray data, it is also of interest to develop a field-friendly approach for detecting and quantifying both immature (indication of conversion to sexual development) and mature (indication of infectiousness to mosquito vector) gametocyte stages. Transcriptional approaches such as RT-PCR, QT-NASBA and RT-LAMP have been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Niederwieser1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Schneider1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Buates1">[9]</xref> using the established mature gametocyte marker <italic>Pfs25</italic> and the putative immature gametocyte marker <italic>Pfs16</italic>. While these approaches enable sensitive detection of these transcripts, it is unclear how the detection of these transcripts - particularly <italic>Pfs16</italic> - relates to actual gametocyte carriage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Schneider1">[8]</xref>. The development of a qRT-PCR-based assay has thus far been impeded primarily because this approach cannot distinguish transcript from genomic DNA when sequences are identical; the majority of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes lack introns and thus have identical sequences for both RNA and DNA. It is therefore worth identifying novel intron-containing markers for which exon-exon junction-spanning primers can be designed so that this approach can be used for <italic>in vivo</italic> gametocyte quantification.</p>
<p>Our goal was thus to develop a new transcript-based gametocyte model that addressed these challenges. Using a deconvolution approach, we quantified the stage-specificity of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transcripts genome-wide and subsequently identified intron-containing markers from across the full range of asexual and sexual development. In order to identify expression patterns specific to different gametocyte stages, particularly the immature stages, existing <italic>in vitro</italic> asexual and sexual developmental time course samples were re-analyzed to account for their mixed stage composition. We further developed a qRT-PCR assay based on these results and, applying the model in reverse, established an algorithm to estimate the amounts of immature and mature sexual and asexual stages in a patient sample based on the expression of a small set of stage-specific markers. This was inspired by related approaches that have been used successfully in dealing with mixed cancerous/non-cancerous tissue samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Clarke1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Stuart1">[11]</xref> and with mixed stages of budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Paul1">[12]</xref>. This framework is implemented for public use at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/malaria2013" xlink:type="simple">http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/malaria2013</ext-link>; as a transmission-focused tool, this system can be applied in epidemiological settings, and as such will ideally support efforts directed toward reducing malaria prevalence worldwide.</p>

<title>Calculation of gene-specific expression contributions to each life cycle stage</title>
<p>To identify expression patterns of individual stage categories while accounting for mixed stage composition, we began by using a labeled set of microarray data with asexual and gametocyte proportions assessed manually by microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Young1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-LeRoch1">[5]</xref>. For our purposes, we divided the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> intra-erythrocytic development into categories that reflect physiologically relevant distinctions during the course of natural infection in the human host. Specifically, we separated those phases found sequestered in tissues from those found in circulation, resulting in a total of five categories. These included two asexual categories, i) the circulating ring stage (termed “R”) and ii) the sequestering trophozoite and schizont stage (termed “T”). The three gametocyte categories were i) the young (Stage I, termed “YG”) and ii) intermediate (gametocyte stages II, III, IV, termed “DG”) immature gametocytes that are absent from circulation and iii) the circulating mature stage V gametocyte (termed “MG”). For most analyses, we grouped YG and DG together as one category encompassing all immature gametocytes (termed “IG”).</p>
<p>We subsequently constructed a constrained regression model to identify the degree to which each <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gene's expression varied with respect to life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The model parameters encode the relative expression of each gene that can be attributed to each life cycle stage, five of which are described above and a sixth category representing transcriptional activity not well-captured by any of these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The model was initially fit using microarray expression data from three time courses spanning the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> intra-erythrocytic life cycle wherein the stage distributions at each of the time points were determined by microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Young1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-LeRoch1">[5]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g001">Figure 1D-1</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Definition of physiologically relevant stage categories within <italic>P. falciparum</italic> development for which we will identify stage-specific expression signatures. Stages are as follows: R: asexual ring, T: asexual trophozoite and schizont, YG: young gametocyte ring and stage I, DG: developing gametocyte stages II, III, and IV, IG: all immature gametocytes (YG+DG), MG: mature gametocyte stage V, and U: unexpected profile not captured by our defined stages.

<p>In any one time point or sample, the total transcript abundance <italic>y<sub>g</sub></italic> for each gene <italic>g</italic> was modeled as a mixture of its abundance in each specific stage. The mixture fraction <italic>x<sub>s</sub></italic> represented the fraction of parasites in stage <italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and the model was constrained to require the sum of <italic>x<sub>s</sub></italic> across stages to remain equal to one. The contribution of each stage to <italic>g</italic>'s overall transcript abundance was captured as <italic>β<sub>g,s</sub></italic> parameters which provided not only predictive accuracy but were also used to identify stage-specific gene sets and pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g001">Figure 1D-2</xref>). After identifying each gene <italic>g</italic>'s stage-specific parameters <italic>β<sub>g,s</sub></italic>, but before winnowing them down to a minimal set of sentinel markers, we inspected the resulting genome-wide characterization of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> life cycle transcriptional activity in order to identify stage-specific pathways and regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Prior to selecting individual stage-specific sentinel genes from these data, stage-specific pathway activity was assessed genome-wide using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Since the standard gene sets available for GSEA are somewhat sparse for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, a pathway database was constructed using the gene annotations in PlasmoDB for the Gene Ontology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Ashburner1">[13]</xref> (see also Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003392.s004">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003392.s005">S3</xref>). These gene sets were then used with GSEA on our model parameters, employing the genome-wide <italic>β<sub>g,s</sub></italic> parameters z-scored across stages as a pre-ranked statistic for enrichment testing. The resulting stage-specific pathway enrichments included biological activities that are known to be associated with particular stages in the asexual cycle, such as host cell remodeling in ring stages (R) and host cell invasion and replication in the later stages of the asexual cycle (T). Our analysis supports earlier observations from the initial gametocyte transcriptome study and a more recent early gametocyte proteome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Young1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Silvestrini1">[14]</xref> that mitochondrial and lipid metabolism are significantly up-regulated during early sexual development, as well as factors involved in cell cycle control. We also observed enrichment of endocytic pathways and cytoskeletal remodeling during later stages of sexual development. These processes are likely linked to hemoglobin uptake and exflagellation during male gametogenesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003392.s004">Table S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Signatures of natural selection</title>
<p>Interaction with the host immune system can result in a higher rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in these interactions. Since life cycle stages vary in their level of interaction with the host immune system, we were interested in whether any of our stage-specific gene sets varied in signatures of natural selection. As a measure for balancing selection within a parasite population, we determined the genetic diversity of individual genes within the three gametocyte stages and two asexual stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). For this purpose, we calculated SNP <bold>π</bold> values for each gene based on a sequence comparison from 25 culture-adapted strains from Senegal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-VanTyne1">[15]</xref>. SNP <bold>π</bold> quantifies the average number of pairwise differences among a set of strains at a set of assayed SNPs. As a complementary measure for positive selection between populations, we also calculated Fst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Neafsey1">[16]</xref> when comparing the 25 strains from Senegal with a reference line from Honduras, HB3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Walliker1">[17]</xref>. Our analysis demonstrated that none of the genes from within the set of highly stage-specific asexual and sexual markers are under increased selection compared to the genomic average, neither within a population nor between two populations. This suggests that the stage-specific transcripts identified by this process are enriched, by these criteria, for gene products core to the regulatory program or stage transitions themselves, excluding proteins that would interact more directly with the host. Such conserved genes are likely to serve as robust markers in lab and field samples alike.</p>

<title>Marker selection overview</title>
<p>After characterizing the genome-wide stage-specific gene expression of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we proceeded to identify a small subset of markers sufficient to recapitulate genome-wide resolution for stage prediction. To combine predictive accuracy with biological interpretability, we chose to identify the single markers representing each stage category while still minimizing prediction error. This resulted in a set of filtering criteria to obtain markers validated to be stage-specific and suitable for use in microarray and qRT-PCR analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g001">Figure 1C and 1D-3</xref>).</p>

<title>Selection of asexual-specific and constitutively expressed markers</title>
<p>To identify optimal markers for the better studied asexual R and T stages, we began with the stage-specific gene sets identified for each stage and first filtered based on presence of intron(s).

Next, we ranked genes based on frequency of retention during model predictive marker selection (see Methods) and used raw expression information such as lack of allelic expression variation, high absolute expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-LeRoch1">[5]</xref>, and stage-specific expression evidence by expression timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Bozdech1">[4]</xref> as additional filters. Based on this process, we selected <italic>PFE0065w</italic> for the early asexual stage (R). It encodes skeletal-binding protein 1 (SBP1), a well-characterized component of parasite-induced membrane structures in the host red blood cell (RBC) termed Maurer's clefts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Blisnick1">[19]</xref>. Using these same criteria, we selected <italic>PF10_0020</italic> as the late asexual stage (T) marker. The gene encodes a protein that is predicted to be secreted into the host RBC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Sargeant1">[20]</xref> and contains a putative alpha/beta hydrolase domain. It is highly specific for late asexual stages not only based on the β<italic><sub>g,s</sub></italic> parameter, but also based on its independent gene expression profile from a comparative transcriptional analysis of three <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Bozdech1">[4]</xref>.

<title>Selection of gametocyte stage-specific markers</title>
<p>To select gametocyte markers, we began with the stage-specific gene sets identified for each stage category as above (YG, DG, or MG) and filtered first based on the presence of intron(s). Next, we retained only those genes in which mass spectrometry data again confirmed expression in the gametocyte development and absence in asexual development, providing evidence both for stage-specific activity and lack of evidence for non-specific stages. These criteria revealed a shortlist of gametocyte-specific candidates with high predictive accuracy, but in the case of the MG stage, no markers showed high and stage-specific expression levels (as defined by the β<italic><sub>g,s</sub></italic> parameter) comparable to the currently used gametocyte marker <italic>Pfs25</italic>. We therefore decided to include <italic>Pfs25</italic> as a MG marker to model stage distribution in microarray data, as the major criterion against using it for qRT-PCR (i.e. absence of an intron), does not apply to the analysis of chip-based data. For the remaining gametocyte stage categories in which highly expressed markers were successfully identified, we ranked gene lists based on frequency of retention during model predictive marker selection and selected <italic>PF14_0748</italic> and <italic>PF14_0367</italic> to represent young (YG) and developing (DG) gametocytes, respectively. <italic>PF14_0748</italic> has previously been identified as an early gametocyte marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Young1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Eksi1">[6]</xref>, and it has been demonstrated that its promoter can drive gametocyte-specific reporter expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Eksi1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Buchholz1">[22]</xref>.

Making predictions based on gene expression from our selected marker set, we successfully predict the transition from asexual to sexual development across the life cycle time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g003">Figure 3 A/B</xref>).

<title>Application of the model to <italic>in vivo</italic> malaria cohort and <italic>in vitro</italic> drug perturbation microarray samples</title>
<p>To gauge how this modeling process performed on patient microarray samples, we applied it to microarray data from two patient cohorts, i) a previously published cohort of severe malaria patients from Blantyre, Malawi collected in 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Milner1">[23]</xref> and ii) a cohort of uncomplicated malaria patients from Thies, Senegal collected in 2008. While no staging information was available for the Senegal patients, a subset of Malawi patients were previously identified as gametocyte-positive by thick smears. The model inferred that the majority of patients from both cohorts have a strong ring-dominated profile, with the next largest subset being late asexual stages (trophozoites and schizonts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g004">Figure 4A/B</xref>). For the 10 Malawi samples in which gametocytes were observed by thick smear, our model correctly identifies 4 (40%) as such, with 0 false positive developing or mature gametocytes predicted among the 48 thick smear-negative patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>A subset of the uncomplicated malaria patients from Senegal were also predicted to be gametocyte carriers (6 of mature, 1 of developing and 1 of young gametocytes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). As microscopy-based information was unavailable for the Senegalese cohort, we assessed how our gametocyte inferences correlated with patient parameters. Of the 6 parameters we measured for this cohort, illness duration and hematocrit differed significantly between the group of patients inferred to be gametocyte carriers and those inferred to be gametocyte-negative. The former had a longer duration of illness (6.33 days±1.02 SEM) than the latter (3.84 days±0.25 SEM, t-test p = 0.0014) as well as a lower hematocrit measured in percent cell volume (34.86%±2.17 SEM) than the latter (40.41%±1.06 SEM, t-test p = 0.031) (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003392.s006">Table S4</xref>). This finding agrees with published data on clinical correlates of gametocyte carriage: long illness duration (greater than 2 days) and anemia (hematocrit less than 30%) were both independently found to be risk factors of gametocytemia in uncomplicated malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Price1">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>Evaluation of drug treatment on parasite stage distribution <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>We concluded validation of the microarray model by using it to profile the effects of drug treatments on parasite stage distribution. This application is of particular interest as it was recently demonstrated that currently used anti-malarial treatments including artemesinin combination therapy (ACT) have limited efficacy against mature gametocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Adjalley1">[25]</xref>. As a proof-of-concept we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> time course experiments for subsequent microarray analysis with a gametocyte-producing line of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (3D7) in which parasites were grown in the presence of two experimental antimalarial compounds, Genz-666136 and Genz-644442. Genz-666136 is known to inhibit parasite dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Booker1">[26]</xref>. Genz-644442 was identified as a potent antimalarial compound with unknown target in a recent small molecule screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Barker1">[27]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sexual differentiation in response to these compounds has not been previously explored.</p>
<p>In both the treated and untreated control samples, our model predicted an initial, subsequently decreasing fraction of the population to consist of young gametocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The presence of young gametocytes is likely due to increased conversion of gametocytes in response to growth at the relatively high starting parasitemia used, an established induction factor of <italic>in vitro</italic> gametocyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Fivelman1">[28]</xref>. Mature gametocytes appeared in both drug-treated time course experiments 20 hours post invasion, while in the control experiment, we observed an expected progression from ring to trophozoite stages. The presence of mature gametocytes at 20 hours could reflect a differential killing effect of the drug on asexual stages versus mature gametocytes; this would induce exactly the inferred increase in relative proportion of gametocytes. A drug-induced stalling of asexual development is predicted in both time courses, as evidenced by the decreasing fraction of late asexual stages from 10 to 20 hours under drug treatment, compared with a constantly increasing late asexual fraction in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment with both compounds, but to a greater extent with Genz-666136, resulted in an increasing proportion of transcriptional signature that could not be assigned to one of our stage categories (shown as “unknown”, gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). It is possible that the increase in unknown transcriptional signature corresponds to an increase in dying parasites across the drug-treated growth experiment. By microscopy, stalled and dying asexual parasites could be observed in both drug-treated time courses.</p>

<title>Application of the model for qRT-PCR–based inference of stage composition <italic>in vitro</italic> and in malaria patients</title>
<p>We next sought to test a variation of the microarray-based model for application to transcriptional measurements obtained by PCR, which might eventually be more appropriate for a field assay. As no MG marker that achieved our filtering criteria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) for qRT-PCR also matched both the high expression levels and stage-specificity of the existing <italic>Pfs25</italic> marker for gametocyte detection, we assessed the utility of the YG and DG markers in combination for the prediction of immature and mature gametocyte quantities when applying the model to qRT-PCR data. Specifically, <italic>PF14_0748</italic> and <italic>PF14_0367</italic> were likely to represent immature (IG) and mature (MG) gametocytes in combination, as <italic>PF14_0367</italic> had a β<italic><sub>g,s</sub></italic> parameter similar to that of <italic>Pfs25</italic> in mature gametocyte stages. We therefore cross-validated this 5-marker PCR set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003392-t001">Table 1</xref>) comparably to the 6-marker microarray set, using the <italic>in vitro</italic> microarray time courses as described above.

The asexual markers alternate with respect to time points in which there were predominately rings or trophozoites and schizonts in the culture, with similar results for both the F12 and 3D7 lines. The sexual markers demonstrate stage-specificity within the 3D7 time course and no appreciable expression in the F12 line once normalized.

<p>Of the 86 samples examined, 8 were gametocyte-positive by thick smear. We performed qRT-PCR on these samples and 8 matched gametocyte-negative samples with equivalent parasitemias. Seven of the 8 (88%) microscopy-positive gametocyte carriers were qRT-PCR positive for one or both gametocyte markers, while only three of the 8 (38%) matched microscopy-negative individuals were positive for either gametocyte marker, with highest levels of expression observed in the microscopy-positive gametocyte carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003392-g005">Figures 5E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several highly sensitive single-marker molecular assays are currently used to detect <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametocytes. None of these existing tools have been appropriate for detection and quantification of the relevant range of parasite stages present during infection, however, due primarily to the lack of a sufficiently broad panel of stage-specific markers. Further, since malaria parasite populations exist as mixtures of the different phases of the life cycle, assays combining multiple markers require customized computational analysis methods for dealing with this complexity. We combined the development of such a bioinformatic deconvolution approach with panels of stage-specific, intron-containing markers appropriate both for microarray analysis and a newly developed qRT-PCR assay. This multi-marker platform enabled us not only to detect gametocyte carriers but primarily to infer the relative amounts of sexual and asexual stages within a sample. We provide an implementation of this platform for further development and application, particularly for refinement in field settings. This process can also be adapted bioinformatically by the exclusion or inclusion of markers to answer specific questions, such as determination of parasite sex ratios that are known to influence mosquito infectiousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Mitri1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our deconvolution model provided the opportunity to define stage-specific gene sets and to characterize the biology of these stages' expression programs using tools such as GSEA, even in the absence of transcriptional data from pure stage populations. For example, our GSEA analysis confirms earlier studies that suggested increased mitochondrial and lipid metabolism during gametocyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Young1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Okamoto1">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, the analysis also suggests significant enrichment of several markers related to endocytic trafficking in late gametocyte development but not in any other parasite stage. The biological significance of this observation remains to be determined. To put such findings into context and ultimately describe the gametocyte transcriptome at high resolution, a systematic transcriptional re-analysis of the entire <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocyte cycle using isolated and synchronous gametocyte stages will be required.</p>
<p>Transcriptional approaches have significantly increased the sensitivity of gametocyte detection in field-compatible assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Schneider1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Buates1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Schneider2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Stuart2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Niederwieser2">[35]</xref>. However, these have been limited to either (i) qualitative assessments of multiple gametocyte markers, i.e. RT-PCR of immature and mature gametocyte markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Niederwieser2">[35]</xref>, or (ii) quantitative assessments of mature gametocytes only, i.e. QT-NASBA of the gamete surface antigen <italic>Pfs25</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Schneider1">[8]</xref>. In order to properly define the reservoir of parasite and gametocyte carriers in the field, it is imperative to determine both the absolute parasite burden and the stage composition of parasites in the blood circulation. Challenges have prevented the development of a diagnostic that can measure the latter, such as (i) the lack of transcriptional analysis methods to identify gametocytes with high specificity in a sample containing a mixture of stages, (ii) the lack of validated immature gametocyte markers, and (iii) the lack of known intron-containing qRT-PCR compatible markers for all stages. We tackled these challenges by developing a model specific to the quantification process and ensuring that it was compatible with both microarray and qRT-PCR measurements. This is distinct, of course, from models that would focus only on sensitivity and specificity of gametocyte <italic>detection</italic> from such data, which represent a potentially fruitful course of future computational investigation. Instead, by incorporating relative expression values of the markers, the model allowed us both to identify a subset of patients as gametocyte carriers and to additionally quantify sub-categories of immature and mature gametocyte fractions within the mixture of stages in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Following validation of our model on samples for which stage composition was known, we applied our model to two microarray data sets in which stage composition was unknown: (i) a cohort of uncomplicated malaria patients, and (ii) two <italic>in vitro</italic> growth experiments in the presence of drug. In the former, we found that both mean illness duration and hematocrit differed between inferred gametocyte carriers and non-carriers, in agreement with published data demonstrating that long illness duration and low hematocrit is linked to gametocyte carriage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003392-Price1">[24]</xref>. In the latter, we observed an increase in the fraction of mature gametocytes as well as unexplained transcriptional signature upon the addition of drug treatment to parasites. The enrichment of mature rather than young gametocytes in response to drug treatment suggests that the drug selectively kills asexual stages, leaving gametocytes unaffected rather than inducing the development of new young gametocytes. The increase in unexplained signatures likely indicates the transition to unhealthy, dying parasite fractions. These applications demonstrate the range of potential uses for this inference tool.</p>
<p>As the exon-exon junction spanning primer/probe sets for 5 markers designed here represent the first attempt at a multi-marker gametocyte-staged qRT-PCR assay, further modeling of PCR-specific measurement error and careful standardization of experimental protocol for this difficult task will both improve field inferences. Like the microarray expression model, however, this model successfully recapitulated the transition from asexual to sexual development across multiple <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments even on first application. When used initially <italic>in vivo</italic> for blood samples from a cohort of children with severe malaria in Malawi, the system successfully identified a subset of patients as immature and/or mature gametocyte carriers. Because immature gametocytes in particular are present in the body several days before the more mature forms emerge, our approach for detecting them could be used in further investigations into factors that influence gametocyte conversion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The assay and algorithm framework presented here has potential for use in epidemiological studies such as those of asymptomatic carriers, who likely represent a major reservoir for malaria transmission. Multiple such studies are already ongoing and will yield additional samples to further optimize computational models of gametocyte differentiation. This is also true of data generated from other sensitive expression platforms such as glass-slide arrays or Nanostring. The inference process may thus have applications in better understanding the natural progression of malaria in the human host, by identifying gametocytes earlier in the course of infection and determining the impact of specific drug treatments on gametocyte development. By scaling to future population-level screens, the resulting information will help better characterize the epidemiology of gametocytemia based on malaria transmission intensity, geography, climate and season.</p>
