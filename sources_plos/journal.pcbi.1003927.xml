<abstract>
<p>The ability to determine one's location is fundamental to spatial navigation. Here, it is shown that localization is theoretically possible without the use of external cues, and without knowledge of initial position or orientation. With only error-prone self-motion estimates as input, a fully disoriented agent can, in principle, determine its location in familiar spaces with 1-fold rotational symmetry. Surprisingly, localization does not require the sensing of any external cue, including the boundary. The combination of self-motion estimates and an internal map of the arena provide enough information for localization. This stands in conflict with the supposition that 2D arenas are analogous to open fields. Using a rodent error model, it is shown that the localization performance which can be achieved is enough to initiate and maintain stable firing patterns like those of grid cells, starting from full disorientation. Successful localization was achieved when the rotational asymmetry was due to the external boundary, an interior barrier or a void space within an arena. Optimal localization performance was found to depend on arena shape, arena size, local and global rotational asymmetry, and the structure of the path taken during localization. Since allothetic cues including visual and boundary contact cues were not present, localization necessarily relied on the fusion of idiothetic self-motion cues and memory of the boundary. Implications for spatial navigation mechanisms are discussed, including possible relationships with place field overdispersion and hippocampal reverse replay. Based on these results, experiments are suggested to identify if and where information fusion occurs in the mammalian spatial memory system.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Spatial navigation is one of the most important functions of animal brains. Multiple regions and cell types encode the current location in mammalian brains, but the underlying interactions between sensory and memory information remain unclear. Recent experimental and theoretical evidence have been found to suggest that the presence of a boundary fundamentally alters the task of navigation. In this paper, evidence is provided that it is possible to determine the location inside any familiar arena with 1-fold rotational symmetry, while completely ignoring sensory cues from the outside world. Surprisingly, the results show that the mere knowledge of the boundary's existence is enough, without requiring direct physical contact. Localization is robust despite the presence of noise modelled from the rodent head direction system, and even inaccuracies in the navigation system's memory of the boundary or internal models of noise. In circular arenas, rotational asymmetry can arise from interior structures such as barriers or voids, also without contact information. This theoretical evidence highlights the need to distinguish arena-based navigation common to most experimental studies, from open field navigation. These findings also point to novel ways to study information fusion in mammalian brains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accurate spatial navigation is crucial to animal survival. Localization is the process of determining current location, critical for many navigation behaviours. Starting from an unknown location and direction (jointly called “pose”), the ability to localize is thought to depend on the detection of world-based (‘allothetic’) cues such as visual landmarks. In contrast, it is thought that animal-based (‘idiothetic’) cues which provide self-motion estimates, e.g., from vestibular, proprioceptive or motor command signals, can only serve to maintain localization briefly, requiring allothetic cues for error correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Bures1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Milford1">[5]</xref>. This is because cumulative errors will degrade self-motion estimates of position over time, not improve it.</p>
<p>In the rodent brain, the firing of both place and grid cells strongly correlate with the animal's physical location in a familiar space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Jeffery1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-OKeefe1">[10]</xref>, with firing patterns being stable over days to weeks in the same environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Ziv1">[11]</xref>. Such neural correlates demonstrate that an animal can robustly localize itself within a familiar arena. A consistent feature of these neural correlates of localization is their persistence without vision, for upwards of 30 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Save1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Hafting1">[13]</xref>. One possible strategy is to use idiothetic path integration (iPI) whereby an animal keeps track of its current position by summing idiothetic estimates of displacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-McNaughton2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Benhamou1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung2">[16]</xref>, but this process is known to suffer from cumulative errors. In an open field, error accumulation due to iPI will lead to a rapid increase in discrepancy between true position and estimated position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Benhamou1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung2">[16]</xref>. It follows that, if using only iPI, a navigation system cannot accurately estimate its location in the long term, and certainly cannot localize itself starting from an unknown pose. An important biological implication is that stable, spatially-selective firing patterns such as those of rodent hippocampal place cells or medial entorhinal grid cells cannot depend purely on iPI.</p>
<p>Most experiments investigating neural correlates of spatial behaviour have been performed in either linear tracks or 2D arenas, the latter termed ‘open fields’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Derdikman1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-OKeefe1">[10]</xref>. On their own, featureless arena boundaries do not provide sufficient spatial information for localization without vision. This is due to a combination of geometric properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung3">[17]</xref>, and infinite poses which equally account for the detection of a point along a featureless boundary during boundary contact. The problem is compounded further if boundary contact (an allothetic cue) is not available or used. The mere knowledge of a boundary's geometry is therefore insufficient for localization, and might be interpreted as support that arena boundaries do not significantly aid localization compared to boundary-less open fields.</p>
<p>Contrary to the above supposition, it is demonstrated here that long-term accurate localization is possible if idiothetic self-motion cues are combined with boundary information already in memory. In particular, the previously acquired boundary map limits the growth of uncertainty due to noisy self-motion information. Surprisingly, the act of sensing the boundary or any other landmark is not necessary. Metrics based on information theoretic principles are used to quantify localization performance. Grid cell simulations are used to provide both a visual display of time-averaged localization performance, and to predict the optimal spatial selectivity that may be expected of neural firing patterns, based on published rodent neural data.</p>

<title>PI alone cannot maintain an accurate position estimate in the long term, even with a compass</title>
<p>As a baseline, both iPI and aPI (allothetic PI implies PI using a compass) performance were quantified without arena memory, in a kite-shaped arena. Even for the simplified task of PI initially orientated, localization failed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g001">Fig. 1A, 1B</xref>). The median place stability index, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, fell below 0.5 (chance level) in 3 minutes using iPI alone, and under 6 minutes using aPI alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), consistent with the generally-accepted idea that cumulative PI errors degrade location estimates over time. Using iPI, the circular variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which measures the particle filter's directional performance across trials, increased from 0 (no error) to close to 1 (uniformly random orientation). In contrast, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> remained close to 0 using aPI since the compass continually reset orientation errors. Using either type of PI, spatially-selective firing patterns could not be maintained beyond 1–2 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The more general task of localization initially disoriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>) further increased localization difficulty, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> throughout the simulation period, and no grid-like firing pattern was observed. Taken together, it was clear that neither aPI or iPI alone could enable localization. Next, idiothetic self-motion cues were combined with arena memory information.</p>

<title>Sufficient spatial information to express location estimates as grids</title>
<p>To determine whether the idiothetic localization described above could sustain spatially selective firing patterns similar to those of grid cells, a stochastic spiking model of grid cells was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung3">[17]</xref> (SI Modelling and Analysis).

<p>Distinct grids were seen both when the animal was initially oriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, row 1) and initially disoriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, row 2). Autocorrelograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, right column) of the normalized firing fields showed spatial regularity similar to grid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Hafting1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Stensola1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Barry1">[19]</xref>.

<title>Arena properties allowing idiothetic localization</title>
<p>A range of boundary properties were found to be compatible with idiothetic localization, including one axis of reflective symmetry (all arenas of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), arena concavity (T-maze arena), lack of vertices and straight edges (egg-shaped arena), or a circular outer arena boundary (void landmark arena). In all cases, the spatial information content and gridness indices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s006">Table S1</xref>) demonstrated spatial specificity comparable to published rodent place and grid cell data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Barry1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Burgess1">[20]</xref>. However, localization metrics including <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, left) and <italic>I<sub>p</sub></italic> distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, right) varied with arena, showing that idiothetic localization performance depended on arena geometry. Noise level, additional allothetic boundary contact information and arena size also had graded effects on localization performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s007">Text S1</xref> - Supporting Results, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s001">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanism of localization from initial disorientation may be intuited by considering the mechanism of action of a particle filter. Among a large number of initially random pose hypotheses (represented by particles), some are close to the true pose while others are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, left). A poor initial pose estimate is more likely to result in an estimated trajectory which crosses a boundary in memory, compared to a good initial pose estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, middle and right).</p>

<p>Over time, estimates cluster around the true pose, plus any rotationally symmetric poses. The latter occurs because in arenas with <italic>n</italic>-fold rotational symmetry (<italic>n</italic>-RS), there are <italic>n</italic> poses which are geometrically equivalent and consistent with the boundary map, making idiothetic localization to a unique pose impossible. Therefore the combination of boundary asymmetry and an internal model of boundary crossing sufficed for idiothetic localization.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Predictions of idiothetic localization</title>
<p>Through careful inspection of the particle filter model, five further predictions related to idiothetic localization were made and demonstrated through simulations using the rodent HD error model. Firstly, local arena geometry was expected to affect the <italic>I<sub>p</sub></italic> value differently in arenas with the same degree of rotational symmetry, since within each of <italic>n</italic> sectors of an arena with <italic>n</italic>-RS, localization should be possible with performance depending on the sector's asymmetry. An adjusted <italic>I<sub>p</sub>*</italic> for <italic>n</italic>-RS arenas was found to be positively correlated to the average rotational asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s007">Text S1</xref> - Modelling and Analysis), confirming that both local and global rotational asymmetry affected localization performance.</p>
<p>A second prediction was that an asymmetric interior barrier could replace rotational asymmetry in the traversable space, and was tested in a circular arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Modelling boundary crossings, a circular traversable area (<italic>∞</italic>-RS) allowed idiothetic localization when an internal barrier was present. However, localization failed when estimated movements were represented as discrete steps which ignored barrier crossings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s007">Text S1</xref> - Modelling and Analysis), showing that the way that self-motion cues and arena memory information are combined can significantly affect performance. In this instance, being able to determine whether a boundary has been crossed was more important for the navigation system than merely determining whether it remained inside the arena. In the particle filter, the pose hypotheses (particles) which crossed any boundary were removed, even if they remained within the traversable space of the remembered arena. A related prediction was that intermittent use of a compass suffices for localization in empty circular arenas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), since a compass directly breaks rotational symmetry in any arena. In this way, allothetic compass information may be incorporated infrequently, while place information is maintained using idiothetic cues for most of the time. Importantly, no ‘reset’ of the position estimate was required – only breaking of rotational symmetry through the compass.</p>
<p>A third prediction was that the centre of a finite-sized navigating agent need not reach the arena boundary, if it used an internal model of its own perimeter. This was demonstrated using an elliptic agent using both random and thigmotactic (wall following) trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Accuracy was significantly improved by using a thigmotactic movement strategy, demonstrating trajectory-dependence of localization performance.</p>

<p>A fourth prediction was that the test arena may vary slightly from the learned arena.

Grid modes showed greater spatial specificity following <italic>X</italic> or <italic>Y</italic> expansion, than along both directions. Partial grid rescaling was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Barry1">[19]</xref>, principally along the expansion direction. These results show that strict congruence between the learned and test arena was unnecessary, but that spatial specificity was affected by a disparity between the learned and actual boundary.</p>
<p>A final prediction was that the true pose at the beginning of a disoriented trial can be recovered by replaying self-motion estimates in reverse. In real time, the initial pose estimate was uniformly distributed over the arena in all directions. Following a period of localization, the final pose estimate was treated as the initial pose estimate of the same trajectory replayed in reverse, in an ‘offline’ manner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g005">Fig. 5</xref> shows that following reverse replay, pose estimates were substantially improved from real-time pose estimates during initial localization, which were optimal at the time. Assuming that a sequence of self-motion estimates can be stored and retrieved later, this simple strategy can significantly improve a past pose estimate retrospectively. Alternatively, an ‘online’ backward inference procedure can also be used to achieve retrospective localization for a chosen time, without storing self-motion estimates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s005">Fig. S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s007">Text S1</xref> – Modelling and Analysis, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s007">Text S1</xref> - Supporting Results). The ability to accurately recover the starting pose implies that homing is possible using only idiothetic sensory cues, even when initially disoriented. In principle, direct homing can occur after an indefinite period of time, since both current pose and initial pose (‘home’) can be determined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Idiothetic localization is a dynamic process</title>
<p>In terms of a particle filter, idiothetic localization can be seen as a consequence of a dynamic competition between increasing uncertainty due to iPI errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and decreasing uncertainty due to culling of invalid hypotheses which cross a boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The rate of increase of uncertainty (diffusion-like particle cloud expansion) depends on the magnitude of intrinsic iPI errors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) and path structure (e.g., path tortuosity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung2">[16]</xref>, arena size and shape). The rate of decrease of uncertainty (i.e., particle culling) depends on the interaction of arena shape (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), size (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) and path structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). When the factors affecting the rate of increase and decrease in uncertainty are kept constant over a prolonged period of time, a dynamic equilibrium is reached which corresponds to the plateau seen in most <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> functions.</p>
<p>The complex interactions between arena shape, size and path structure are briefly described. Intuitively, if relatively few pose hypotheses (particles) can account for a sequence of displacements, uncertainty tends to decrease. For example, a path taken from the acute to obtuse to a right angle corner of a kite arena cannot be accounted for by any particle trajectory except one which is close to the true trajectory. In contrast, there are infinite possible paths which span the diameter of a circular arena or follow its boundary, so there are always a range of particle trajectories which can account for any displacement sequence arising in a circular arena. Consequently, determining a unique location is impossible. In a given 1-RS arena, the path structure determines the relative uniqueness of the displacement sequences. Hence very few thigmotactic loops around a 1-RS arena (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) are required to uniquely determine location, within the limits of noise. Therefore, when rotational asymmetry is due to an outer boundary, thigmotaxis is an efficient strategy for localization. In contrast, a trajectory biased towards the center of such an arena takes longer for localization, and the agent spends relatively longer time periods poorly localized leading to a lower level of equilibrium performance. Thus large arenas tend to increase uncertainty since more time is spent in the centre of the arena. This effect is exacerbated by the nonlinear increase in positional uncertainty due to unconstrained iPI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung2">[16]</xref>. It is important to note that these effects are not applicable if the rotational asymmetry is due only to an interior arena structure such as a barrier or void. In this case, thigmotaxis is not sufficient for localization, while a trajectory bias towards the arena centre will improve localization compared to a random trajectory.</p>
<p>The magnitudes of the competing rates of increase and decrease in uncertainty also depend on the initial pose distribution (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s002">S2</xref>). For example, when initially disoriented, a large portion of pose hypotheses are grossly incompatible with self-motion cues given the known arena, resulting in a relatively high rate of decrease in uncertainty (particle culling) relative to the increase from iPI (diffusive expansion of particle cloud). Consequently, overall uncertainty decreases, leading to improved localization when initially disoriented. In contrast, when initially oriented, the majority of pose hypotheses remain compatible with self-motion information so the rate of particle culling is low relative to the diffusive expansion of the particle cloud due to iPI errors. Hence, there is an overall decay in localization performance when initially orientated. In general, the direction of change in localization performance (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) depends on whether the current pose uncertainty is above or below the equilibrium level. In turn, the equilibrium performance level depends on the interaction between iPI errors, arena size, shape and path structure.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Arena rotational asymmetry and boundary maps</title>
<p>By itself, rotational asymmetry is not sufficient for long term localization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> shows that even combining two levels of rotational symmetry breaking (compass+kite arena) is not sufficient for localization. The lack of an arena map led to unlimited growth of uncertainty in the position estimate, despite accurate orientation. In contrast, breaking rotational symmetry in combination with an arena map allowed long term localization (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Hence it is the combination of rotational asymmetry and arena map which allows idiothetic localization.</p>
<p>However, an arena map is not always necessary if allothetic cues are available. When detected, the acute and obtuse corners of a kite arena are unique landmarks which can theoretically be used by a modular navigation system for localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cruse1">[21]</xref>, without requiring a full boundary map in memory. The axis of the two unique landmarks provides the symmetry breaking information (hence orientation), while the point-like nature of each landmark provides location information. Similarly, rats and other animals can leave markings inside arenas which can potentially be used to break rotational symmetry and allow localization even in a circular arena, without a boundary map. Hence it is specifically the restriction to using only idiothetic cues which necessitates both the use of an arena map and presence of rotational asymmetry for successful localization.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Implications for spatial navigation mechanisms</title>
<p>It was shown previously that combining self-motion cues and arena memory significantly slowed the decay of pose estimates in a circular arena, when initially oriented. When allothetic boundary contact cues were included, the residual localization achieved could account for the prolonged stability of rodent place and grid fields observed in darkness despite an unstable head direction system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung3">[17]</xref>. It is now shown that in arenas with 1-fold rotational symmetry, localization decay can in fact be stopped altogether, that allothetic cues are not necessary, and the navigating agent can be initially disoriented. Important implications of these new findings are discussed below.</p>
<p>Using only idiothetic cues in conjunction with information already in memory potentially reduces computational load during navigation. Such a strategy allows a navigating agent to devote computational or attentional resources for processing allothetic sensory information for other tasks. Although precision is reduced, it is likely to be a low-risk strategy since occasional use of allothetic cues suffices to recover near-optimal localization (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). There is evidence that animals may use allothetic sensory cues intermittently during navigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Lent1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Vickers1">[23]</xref>. If allothetic cues are used intermittently during localization by the hippocampal-entorhinal space circuit, two consequences may be observed. Firstly, cumulative spatial uncertainty may increase spatial firing variability beyond that expected from average firing rates. Over multiple passes through the same true location, positional uncertainty will cause variability in the estimated location, potentially reflected in variability in spike activity. This may contribute to the phenomenon of ‘overdispersion’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Fenton1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Fenton2">[25]</xref> observed in CA1 place cells, whose firing fields are influenced by both allothetic cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Muller1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Jeffery2">[27]</xref>, and self-motion information such as via grid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-McNaughton2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Witter1">[28]</xref>. A second possible consequence of cumulative spatial uncertainty is temporary divergence in the spatial code relative to allothetic landmarks. A temporary divergence may contribute to the multiple ensemble place codes which have been reported in rodent CA1, interpreted as alternating attention between distal landmark cues and self-motion cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Fenton2">[25]</xref>. However, the results of the present study suggest that using self-motion cues alone is likely to lead to degradation of the place code within 2–3 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Hence in the long term, attention to self-motion cues is not sufficient to account for a second stable place code, unless there is also intermittent compass information, rotational asymmetry in the arena, or both.</p>
<p>The rodent medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) contains both border cells and grid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Hafting1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Solstad1">[29]</xref>, which raises the possibility that it could be a self-sufficient localization system. If mEC border cells encode a boundary spatial representation, then together with the putative grid cell based path integration system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-McNaughton2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Hafting1">[13]</xref>, fusion of self-motion and boundary memory information should enable localization. If so, stable grid fields are expected to emerge in familiar arenas with 1-fold rotational symmetry, in the absence of vision, initially disoriented, and in a hippocampus-independent manner. However, in arenas with &gt;1-fold rotational symmetry such as circular or square arenas, such a system would require supplementation with a compass cue, at least sporadically (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003927.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). In rodents, the latter could be provided via the visually-stabilised head direction (HD) system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Goodridge1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Taube1">[32]</xref>, whose firing properties mature prior to place and grid cells during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Langston1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Wills1">[34]</xref>, as would be expected if HD cells provided important symmetry-breaking information for place and grid cells.</p>
<p>Boundaries occurring in natural environments rarely have &gt;1-fold rotational symmetry, making it plausible that biological navigation systems may exploit this property for localization. It remains to be tested whether species which spend significant time in enclosed spaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-DePerera1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Barr1">[37]</xref> are more likely to have evolved mechanisms to use this localization strategy. It has been reported previously that the persistent stability of rodent place and grid cell firing in darkness starting from full orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Save1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Hafting1">[13]</xref> is likely to rely on the fusion of self-motion and boundary information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung3">[17]</xref>. Assuming the same type of information fusion occurs starting from full disorientation, the results of the current study suggest the emergence of stable place and grid fields should occur in arenas with 1-fold rotational symmetry.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the localizing mechanism described here need not be restricted to bounded spaces with impassable physical barriers. For instance, this strategy is equally applicable if an animal's trajectory is limited by a few distinct landmarks, forming a virtual arena with 1-fold rotational symmetry in an otherwise open trajectory space. Familiar landmarks could thus be used to break rotational symmetry in the trajectory space without a physical barrier, and resulting in successful localization without knowledge of the distance or allocentric direction to those landmarks during a journey. However, the geometry of the virtual boundary must be known. In this hypothetical example, the trajectory is guided by allothetic cues, while localization uses idiothetic cues and information already in memory.</p>
<p>One prediction of idiothetic localization was that reverse replay of past information enabled retrospective improvement in localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003927-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). That is, knowledge of current location improved when future information became available. Experimentally, replays of sequences of place cell activity corresponding to past behavioural trajectories have been reported during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Louie1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Lee1">[39]</xref> and when awake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Foster1">[40]</xref>, including in reverse temporal order <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Foster1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Diba1">[41]</xref>. The modelling results here suggest that a possible role of hippocampal reverse replay may be to improve past estimates of location, which may in turn improve the accuracy of future path planning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Pfeiffer1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>While the present study examined the information and computations which may be necessary and sufficient to be used in conjunction with a known boundary map for localization, future studies will need to address the acquisition of the boundary map itself. In robotics, particle filter methods have been used successfully to build boundary maps using only self-motion and boundary detection cues, starting from full disorientation – a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Thrun1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Montemerlo1">[44]</xref>. Similar methods may be used to investigate the factors which could affect the acquisition of a boundary map under biologically realistic conditions, and make predictions about localization performance when only imperfect maps are available.</p>

<title>Applications in arena-based experiments</title>
<p>From the findings in this study, it is proposed that spatial memory systems which can effectively combine idiothetic self-motion cues and boundary memory can determine location in familiar arenas with 1-fold rotational symmetry. If allothetic cues are stringently removed, localization necessarily demonstrates the fusion of idiothetic self-motion and memory-based boundary information. This prediction may be tested, for example, by using blindfolded human subjects passively led along random or thigmotactic trajectories. Where <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings are feasible, it may be possible to isolate the cells and circuits where the fusion of idiothetic self-motion and boundary memory information occurs. For instance, if stable mEC grid fields emerge from full disorientation under the cue-restricted conditions described, information fusion must occur either at or upstream of the medial entorhinal grid cells.</p>
<p>Together, the reported results reveal that detection of cues from the external world is not always necessary for localization, that bounded arenas are distinct from true open fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Derdikman1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-OKeefe1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Denenberg1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Giocomo1">[46]</xref>, and that any information which breaks rotational asymmetry may be useful for localization. Furthermore, arena boundaries affect navigational difficulty in a size-, shape- and path- dependent manner, and need to be addressed during the design and interpretation of experiments which investigate the navigational abilities of animals in arenas. Finally, the results suggest that specific arena designs can be used to interrogate the combination of self-motion and memory information in the hippocampal-entorhinal space circuit, whose properties are influenced by environmental boundary information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Stensola1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Solstad1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-OKeefe2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Lever1">[48]</xref>.</p>

<p>It is known from recordings of Head Direction (HD) cells in rats, that error in the estimate of head direction increase steadily as the animal moves away from the place where it was first deprived of its vision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Goodridge1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Clark1">[31]</xref>. The accumulation of errors in head direction was modelled as a Wiener process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung3">[17]</xref>, based on the reported drift in tuning functions of HD neurons without vision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Goodridge1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Clark1">[31]</xref>.

<p>A particle filter was used to approximate Bayes-optimal fusion of idiothetic self-motion and boundary information, to provide the best estimate of successive poses given noisy displacement inputs. The localisation performance, as revealed by this particle filter approach, was analysed across 10<sup>3</sup> random trials in each condition, using metrics developed previously to characterise instantaneous spatial accuracy and precision. Briefly, the median place stability index, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, characterizes the particle filter's localization performance across trials, where 0.5 represents chance (uniform uncertainty within the arena), and 1 represents perfect localization. Similarly, the circular variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003927.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measures the particle filter's directional performance across trials, where 0 represents uniformly random heading estimates, and 1 represents no heading error.</p>
<p>The particle filter estimate of position was then used to simulate the firing activity of grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex, using a stochastic spiking model where spike probability decreased with estimated distance from the neurons' preferred firing locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003927-Cheung3">[17]</xref>.

Doubling the grid spacing (linear scaling, second column) recovered grid modes, which were less distinct than in the standard kite arena (third column). The crosscorrelogram (fourth column) between the normalized firing field of the standard and the 4×-arena (double grid spacing) yielded a gridness index of 0.39. Scale = 50 cm.</p>
