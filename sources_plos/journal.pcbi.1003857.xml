<abstract>
<p>The interchromosomal organization of a subset of human chromosomes (#1, 4, 11, 12, 16, 17, and 18) was examined in G1 and S phase of human WI38 lung fibroblast and MCF10A breast epithelial cells. Radial positioning of the chromosome territories (CTs) was independent of gene density, but size dependent. While no changes in radial positioning during the cell cycle were detected, there were stage-specific differences between cell types. Each CT was in close proximity (interaction) with a similar number of other CT except the gene rich CT17 which had significantly more interactions. Furthermore, CT17 was a member of the highest pairwise CT combinations with multiple interactions. Major differences were detected in the pairwise interaction profiles of MCF10A versus WI38 including cell cycle alterations from G1 to S. These alterations in interaction profiles were subdivided into five types: overall increase, overall decrease, switching from 1 to ≥2 interactions, vice versa, or no change. A global data mining program termed the <italic>chromatic median</italic> determined the most probable overall association network for the entire subset of CT. This probabilistic interchromosomal network was nearly completely different between the two cell lines. It was also strikingly altered across the cell cycle in MCF10A, but only slightly in WI38. We conclude that CT undergo multiple and preferred interactions with other CT in the nucleus and form preferred -albeit probabilistic- interchromosomal networks. This network of interactions is altered across the cell cycle and between cell types. It is intriguing to consider the relationship of these alterations to the corresponding changes in the gene expression program across the cell cycle and in different cell types.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During interphase, chromosomes occupy discrete bodies within the cell nucleus termed chromosome territories (CT). The organization of CT and the genes within them have been implicated in genomic regulation. Numerous reports suggest that specific interchromosomal interactions enable distally located genes to cluster in close proximity for coordinately regulated gene activity. Our overall understanding of CT organization and their interchromosomal interactions, however, is very limited. We have addressed this issue by combining the approaches of 3D FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), an extensive computational program that enables us to obtain precise measurements of CT interactions in 3-D and a novel global data mining program that evaluates the overall arrangement of all the interacting CT. 7 CT pairs ranging in size and gene density were examined in two different human cell types. Our findings demonstrate that: 1) there are preferred interchromosomal networks that are altered across the cell cycle; 2) these alterations are cell type specific; 3) all the CT interact with a similar number of other CT with the exception of the gene rich CT17 which interacts with significantly more CT; and 4) multiple interactions in the four possible combinations between CT pairs are far more common than in random simulations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the highest structural level, chromosomes form discrete bodies termed chromosome territories (CT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Stack1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Cremer3">[6]</xref>. The three-dimensional organization of these CT and the genes within them have been implicated in genomic regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Cremer2">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Bickmore1">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, interactions between CT and other nuclear domains have been shown to impact nuclear functioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Mehta1">[15]</xref>. For instance, chromosomes that contain the nucleolar organizing regions preferentially interact with nucleoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Sullivan1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Raska1">[17]</xref>. While many studies have revealed a probabilistic nonrandom radial organization of CT within the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Cremer4">[18]</xref> for review], fewer reports have investigated whether there are specific interchromosomal arrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Nagele1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Khalil1">[21]</xref> and whether these are altered in different cell and tissue types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Parada1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Marella1">[25]</xref> during cell differentiation and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Kuroda1">[26]</xref> and in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Parada2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Fritz1">[29]</xref>. The predominant method for studying CT organization has involved CT centers of gravity which may or may not reflect interactions of these CT at their borders. Also, due to technical limitations, the vast majority of these studies have been limited to three or less CT pairs per nucleus.</p>
<p>Numerous investigations have demonstrated that large-scale chromatin arrangements within the nucleus are relatively stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Shelby1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Lucas1">[35]</xref> and persist at least to some extent during the cell cycle stages of interphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Walter1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Gerlich1">[37]</xref>. In contrast, analysis of in vivo labeled CT regions indicated that CT centers of gravity are mobile relative to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Csink1">[38]</xref> and to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Walter1">[36]</xref>. While this is consistent with the prospect that the CT may undergo reorganization during the cell cycle, these investigations were not able to identify specific CT in their analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Walter1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Csink1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>With this in mind we have analyzed the 3-D positioning and interchromosomal associations of 7 CT (1,4,11,12,16,17,18) using reFISH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref> in human WI38 lung fibroblasts and MCF10A (10A) breast epithelial cells in the G1 and S cell cycle stages. Differences in associations were found at both the cell type and cell cycle levels. Using a newly developed data mining algorithm termed the <italic>chromatic median</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Ding1">[39]</xref>, probabilistic network models were generated for the global patterns of interchromosomal interactions of all 7 chromosome pairs. The preferred arrangements were strikingly different between 10A and WI38 in both G1 and S phases.</p>
<p>Our findings provide support for a probabilistic “chromosome code” where the overall interactive network of CT is different between cell types and may contribute to the global regulation of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Marella1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Fritz1">[29]</xref>. We further report that this interaction network is altered across the cell cycle in a cell type specific manner.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this study we combine the approaches of re-FISH, computer imaging, computational geometric and data mining to investigate chromosome territory interactions during the cell cycle (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). A subset of 7 chromosomes (CT1, 4, 11, 12, 16, 17, and 18) were selected which are representative of the human genome by having a broad range in size and gene density. The weighted average gene density of this CT subset was 6.5 compared to 6.7 for the entire genome. In brief, WI38 human fibroblasts or MCF10A human epithelial breast cells were grown on gridded coverslips and labeled with EdU (labels S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Cavanagh1">[40]</xref>), geminin (labels S and G2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-SakaueSawano1">[41]</xref>) and three rounds of chromosome paints. The G1 and S stages of the cell cycle for each cell type were then distinguished as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Representative images for EdU and the CT are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>.</p>

<title>CT volumes and radial chromosome positioning in WI38 and MCF10A cells</title>
<p>In both cell types, there was an average total nuclear volume increase of ∼10–15% in S phase compared to G1 and comparable increases in the CT volumes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). A correlation to chromosome size to radial position was demonstrated with the larger CT being more peripherally located (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.72 to 0.92, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), but no correlation to gene density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Random simulations showed no correlation between chromosome size or gene density and radial position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g001">Fig. 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). None of the radial positions were significantly altered from G1 to S phase in WI38, 10A, or random simulations. We did, however, determine significant cell type differences (t test, p&lt;0.05) in radial positioning for CT1 in G1 and CT1, 11, and 17 in S phase.</p>

<title>Pairwise CT interaction profiles are altered across the cell cycle</title>
<p>Although CT centers provide some insight into the positions of CT and organization of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s003">S3</xref>), they do not accurately predict whether a CT pair will be interacting at their borders. We, therefore, determined the nearest border distances between CT as a direct measurement of the nearest distance in 3-D between all CT pairs. Using a maximum of 4 pixels (0.28 µ) as a threshold value for an interacting CT pair, we calculated the number of interactions each CT has to the other CT in the subset. An average of ∼90% of the measured distances that were determined as positive interactions (≤4 pixels) were actually separated by zero pixels and involved direct overlap (average of ∼15% of the volume) of the two interacting CT. Based on these measurements, each CT interacts on average with ∼3 out of the other 12 possible heterologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g001">Fig. 1E,F</xref>), with the gene rich CT17 displaying a significantly higher level of interactions (∼3.5–3.7 CT; t test, p&lt;.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g001">Fig. 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). These levels of interaction are conserved in progression from G1 to S and are virtually identical in WI38 and 10A cells. In random simulations, that utilize the experimental CT volumes within the DAPI signal (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we find significantly lower levels (p&lt;0.001) of interaction with an average of ∼1.5 interactions per CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Since a CT pair can interact up to four times within each nucleus (eg. CT1a-CT2a,1a-2b,1b-2a, and 1b-2b), we determined the percent of cells with 1 or more interactions (≥1), only 1 interaction ( = 1), or greater than 2 (≥2). If there was not a specific overall pattern to the CT associations in the cell nucleus, each pairwise interaction would be close to the average for all of the CT pairs. While the overall patterns for ≥1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) were not significantly different from their averages in both WI38 and 10A cells, significant differences were found when single and multiple interactions were considered separately (chi squared, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s010">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, differences were found in comparing the single and multiple interaction profiles in the G1 and S phases of these two cell lines (p&lt;0.002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s011">Table S2</xref>). Corresponding random simulations do not show any significant differences across the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s011">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 21 pairwise CT combinations in the ≥1 interaction profiles of G1 versus S phase, only 2 were altered (based on a &gt;20% difference) in WI38 and 7 in 10A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). For cells with only 1 interaction, 8 of the 21 pairwise CT combinations were altered from G1 to S phase in both WI38 and 10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) while 11 (WI38) and 13 (10A) of 21 were altered for multiple interactions (≥2). When considering both = 1 and ≥2 together, we found 5 pairwise CT interaction profiles that were altered from G1 to S phase in Wi38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s012">Table S3</xref>), and 13 in 10A (chi-square, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s012">Table S3</xref>). Corresponding random simulations showed no significant differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s007">S7</xref>). While the experimental levels of interaction did not show any relation to CT size, larger CT had higher amounts of interaction in random simulations and ranged from a low of 32% for CT12–18 to 56% for C1–17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s007">S7</xref>). Homologous interactions were lower than heterologous ones even when correcting for the fact that there is only one possible homologous interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s013">Table S4</xref>). In addition, experimental homologous interactions are similar in range to random simulations and do not change significantly across the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Alterations in interaction profiles from G1 to S phase.</title>
<p>Calculation of the ratio between pairwise CT (S∶G1) reveals different alterations of CT interactions from G1 to S. Some alterations demonstrate an overall increase (type 1) in interaction while others have an overall decrease in interaction (type 2). Others switch from having greater levels with a singular interaction to those with more nuclei with multiple interactions (type 3) or vice versa (type 4). Others do not change from G1 to S (type 5). Values are color coded with green increasing the most from G1 to S and red decreasing the most. The types of alterations in interaction are displayed for WI38 and 10A in the center rows.</p>

<p>Multiple interactions are typically less abundant than singular interactions. 16–60% of cells that contain an interaction, however, had multiple interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This is far greater than random simulations (7–28%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s007">S7</xref>). CT17 was represented in 83% of the CT pairs that were in the top half of multiple interactions compared to 42% for CT18. The highest multiple interacting pair in WI38 was CT11–17 in G1 and CT12–17 in S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and CT4–17 (G1) and CT11–17 (S) in 10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>We found three distinct patterns when a CT pair interacts twice (termed 2a, 2b, and 2c, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In pattern 2a, one homolog of each CT is a member of an independent pairwise interaction with its heterologous partner CT. In pattern 2b, a triplet is formed involving one copy of one CT and 2 copies of the other heterologous CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In pattern 2c, the opposite triplet is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Out of the multiple combinations the percent of cells with all four CT forming an alternating chain with 3 interacting CT (pattern 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) were typically less abundant than the other multiple patterns but was the most abundant pattern in 5 out of the 84 pairwise combinations studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Four interactions were rare (∼0–5%) as they only occurred when all four homologs of the two chromosomes were in close apposition. Differences were found between G1 and S in the overall patterns of these configurations for CT pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). For example, some pairwise combinations of CT are equally distributed between 2A–2C patterns (e.g., CT1–11 in WI38 S), while others are present predominantly in one configuration (e.g., CT12–18 in WI38 S). The patterns of these multiple interactions are also different between 10A and WI38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Further analysis revealed dynamic alterations in interaction profiles during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Some CT pairs had an overall increase in both single ( = 1) and multiple (≥2) interactions (type 1), while others decreased in both = 1 and ≥2 from G1 to S phase (type 2). Still others switched from single to multiple interactions (type 3) or vice versa (type 4). Moreover, a significant proportion of the CT pairs did not change in interaction from G1 to S (type 5). In 10A, CT18 is a member of all three CT pairs that increased in overall interaction from G1 to S and CT12 is a member of 5 of the 7 CT pairs that decrease overall in interaction. CT1 switched to more cells with multiple interactions in 4 of the 6 possible pairwise interactions in 10A and 3 of 6 in WI38. These observed altered chromosome interactions are represented within the overall model of CT interactions (see chromatic median section).</p>

<title>The preferred probabilistic model of CT interactions is altered across the cell cycle and between cell types</title>
<p>The difference in the profiles of CT interactions between G1 and S phase of WI38 and 10A cells suggests reorganization in interchromosomal interactions during the cell cycle. Furthermore, it reinforces the concept of cell type specificity to CT organization beyond the Go state. To investigate this further we used an algorithm designed to determine the overall pattern of CT interactions across the population of cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). This program, termed the chromatic median, represents each nucleus as a 14×14 (7 CT for this study, 2 homologs per CT) binary matrix wherein a value of 1 indicates an interaction and a value of 0 indicates the absence of an interaction. It then determines the corresponding homologs across all nuclei based upon the homologs' interactions with all the other individual chromosome heterologs under investigation, thus switching the ‘a’ and ‘b’ labels for homologs based on its interactions with other CT. Subsequently, we determine the percent of cells that contain an interaction for each of the 91 positions in the matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Within the resulting median matrices, we found hot and cold spots that range from 0 to 62% of input cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Random simulations did not show hot spots and the range of values was approximately 2.3 fold less than experimental values (0–27%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s009">Fig. S9</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine a preferred probabilistic model of CT interactions, thresholding was performed on the matrices at 32 (WI38) and 31% (10A) association. This enriched for the CT interactions found at the higher levels among the total population. Moreover, at these thresholds, there are no connections in randomizations of input matrices or random simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). 15–18 CT interactive connections were identified in both the 10A and WI38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Comparison of the models generated from this analysis revealed only modest differences between G1 and S phase of WI38 cells, but massive differences across the cell cycle of 10A. 13 connections were shared between G1 and S of WI38, but only 3 were shared between G1 and S of 10A. The differences between cell types were even more striking. Only 4 were shared in G1 and none were shared in S phase. Thick connecting lines are within the top one third of associations within the model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).

<p>Since random simulations had much lower levels of interaction than experimental (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s009">Fig. S9</xref>), we evaluated whether the high level of interactions in the experimental data falsely lead to a model of interactions instead of random interactions. After running the chromatic median on randomized matrices, the range of values (13–32%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s009">Fig. S9</xref>) was approximately 3.3 fold lower than experimental values which range from 0–62% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The range for experimental is 62 and the range for randomization was 19. 62 divided by 19 is 3.26.

For example, during S phase loosening of chromatin structure enables the replication machinery to access the DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Raynaud1">[49]</xref>. At a global level, as cells progress from early S to mitosis, the chromatin becomes increasingly condensed and less sensitive to DNase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Pfeffer1">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p>Chromatin organization is also thought to be involved in the compartmentalization of the genome and long range interaction between genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Giles1">[51]</xref>. These interactions have been shown to occur in a transcription dependent manner to regulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Osborne1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Clowney1">[55]</xref>. Fundamental to these interactions is the arrangement of chromatin into discrete chromosome territories (CTs) in the interphase nucleus (for review see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Cremer4">[18]</xref>). Despite this progress, our understanding of the spatial positioning of the CTs, their interchromosomal associations and the resulting influence on gene regulation is less clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Berezney1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Bickmore1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Misteli3">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Lanctot1">[58]</xref>. For example, only a few reports have investigated whether there are preferred interchromosomal positional arrangements between CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Nagele1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Fritz1">[29]</xref>. However, the majority of these studies were primarily focused on the gravity centers of CT which may not reflect their interactions at their interfaces and/or were limited to 3 chromosomes per nucleus.</p>
<p>Earlier reports suggested a high degree of stability of the large scale arrangement of chromatin in the cell nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Shelby1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Lucas1">[35]</xref> and during the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Walter1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Gerlich1">[37]</xref>.

However, the identity of the CT could not be determined in these previous studies.</p>
<p>To directly address whether specific CT interactions are altered across the cell cycle, we examined the CT spatial positioning and interchromosomal associations using reFISH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref> to concurrently label 7 CT (1,4,11,12,16,17,18) in the G1 and S phases of WI38 lung fibroblast and MCF10A human breast epithelium cells.

<title>Radial positioning of chromosome territories</title>
<p>The radial positioning of genes has been suggested to be functionally linked to gene expression.

Differences in the nuclear shape of cells may also play a role in CT radial positioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Bolzer1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Neusser1">[77]</xref>.</p>
<p>While it has been reported that CT change their radial organization when cells re-enter the cell cycle from quiescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Bridger1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Mehta2">[79]</xref>, our studies demonstrate that CT do not change their radial positioning during the cell cycle. In contrast, we found that the radial positioning of some CT are different between cell types. These differences between cell types are stage specific. For example CT11 and CT17 are not significantly different in their radial positioning comparing WI38 and 10A in G1, but are in S phase. Importantly, random simulations demonstrated that differences in nuclear shape or CT volume do not account for these changes in radial positioning.</p>

<title>Alterations of interchromosomal organization in the cell cycle</title>
<p>Previous studies of interchromosomal associations based on measurements of the pairwise border distances between individual CT, have suggested an overall non-random nature of these interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Nagele1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Fritz1">[29]</xref>. Our analysis of interchromosomal associations has revealed for the first time, multiple CT associations with an average of ∼3 interactions out of a maximum of 12 for each CT copy or 20–30% of the other heterologs in the CT subset. This extrapolates to 9–13 interactions per chromosome out of the 44 possible heterologous interactions at the whole genome level. Thus each CT in the nucleus is interacting with an amazingly high proportion of the other CTs. There was no relationship between chromosome size and total levels of interaction. For example, even though chromosome 1 is approximately 3.2 fold larger in sequence length than chromosome 18, both have similar levels of interaction. The radial positioning of CT may allow for this equivalent level of interaction as larger CT have large borders with the nuclear periphery. In this view, smaller CT have a larger proportion of their surface area free for interaction with other CT than larger CT. Moreover, the gene rich CT17 interacts with significantly more CT than the gene poor CT18 or CT1. This suggests a possible relationship of the level of interchromosomal associations for a CT to its gene density and/or activity.</p>
<p>While CT17 interacts with more CT in experimental nuclei, in random simulations that account for nuclear and CT volumes, as well as general irregularity in CT shapes, we do not find a gene density correlation to interaction. In a separate investigation from our group we have reported a large variation in chromosome shapes that are related to gene density. Thus gene-rich chromosomes are much more irregular in shape than gene poor ones (Sehgal et al, 2014, manuscript under review). This investigation found that CT17, for example, was much more irregular in shape than the gene poor CT18 in WI38 cells (Sehgal et al., 2014 manuscript under review) Such irregularity could lead to the greater level of interactions displayed by CT17. In this model, extensions from gene rich CT could allow for greater levels of interactions with other CT. It is further proposed that these interchromosomal interactions are critical for the coordinated regulation of the genome. Determining the intrachromosomal organization of CT17 during the cell cycle would enable identification of regions which are frequently external to CT17 and may, therefore interact with regions within other CT.</p>
<p>While the total level of CT interactions did not change from G1 to S, there were significant alterations in singular and multiple CT pairwise interactions. Five types of alterations were determined from G1 to S. Some CT pairs increased in both singular and multiple interactions (type 1), while others decreased in both (type 2). Other CT pairs increased in singular interactions while decreasing in multiples (type 3) or vice versa (type 4). Finally, some CT pairs did not change in their level of interactions (type 5). Moreover, cell type differences were detected for the cell cycle alterations. For example CT1–4 are type 3 in WI38, but type 4 in 10A. Only 4 of the 21 pairwise interactions are altered similarly in WI38 and 10A (eg. CT1–16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous reports have demonstrated cell type specificity to chromosome interactions in G0 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Marella1">[25]</xref>. We, therefore, applied a novel computational data mining and pattern recognition approach termed the <italic>chromatic median</italic> to identify overall patterns of global interactions across the cell cycle in both cell types. A maximum of 18 out of 91 possible connections were found to be above random simulations and randomizations of the input population. While 13 connections within the model of WI38 in G1 are shared in S, only 3 are shared in 10A from G1 to S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Between cell types, only 4 were shared in G1 and none were shared in S indicating cell type differences across the cell cycle. This suggests that certain cell types may demonstrate more alterations in interchromosomal organization across the cell cycle than others.</p>
<p>Our findings support the presence of a higher order probabilistic chromosome code or network of CT interactions inside the cell nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Marella1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Fritz1">[29]</xref>. It is proposed that the preferred interchromosomal association network defined by this code is maintained epigenetically and facilitates specific genomic expression programs characteristic of the particular cell type such as the fibroblast and epithelial cells of this study. The probabilistic nature of the overall interactive network could in turn provide flexibility for alterations in the network and contribute to corresponding changes in the overall genomic program.

These domains were found to be of similar level of activity such that active domains preferentially paired with active (and inactive domains with inactive). Notably, the authors identify multiple domain–domain contacts between CT interfaces. While single-cell Hi-C also demonstrates cell-to-cell variability, our findings indicate that particular homologs of CT display patterns of interaction across the population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g006">6</xref>). Within a pair of CT, we further define the pairwise interaction profile wherein certain CT pairs can demonstrate a greater degree of multiple interactions than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003857-g003">3</xref>). This suggests that while some of these multiple interacting domains between CT interfaces are possibly on the same interacting homologs, they may be distributed between the four possible pairwise interactions (especially on CT pairs that interact as multiples more frequently). In direct agreement with our findings, this investigation similarly found a high level of interchromosomal interactions and that the total level of interactions between chromosomes was independent of chromosome sequence length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Nagano1">[85]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using a on synchronized HeLa cells, it was demonstrated on a population level that the intrachromosomal topologically associating domains identified by this approach are largely maintained across the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Naumova1">[86]</xref>. Further studies using Hi-C approach for studying interchromosomal interactions at the genomic level in both cell populations and at the single cell level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-LiebermanAiden1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Nagano1">[85]</xref>, should enable more detailed definition of the many alterations in chromosomal interactions identified in our investigation. In particular, differences between cells in different stages of the cell cycle within a population could be distinguished via cell sorting followed by single cell Hi-C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Nagano1">[85]</xref>.</p>

<title>3D microscopy and reFISH image analysis</title>
<p>Seven chromosome territory pairs were analyzed by sequential rounds of chromosome territory FISH labeling, image collection, stripping and re-FISH as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>. In the final round EdU replication labeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Cavanagh1">[40]</xref> was used to discriminate between cells that are in S phase versus those that were not. Geminin which labels cells in S/G2/M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-SakaueSawano1">[41]</xref> was used to exclude cells that are in G2. Those cells which are geminin+/EdU- were not analyzed. Images were collected on an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Sensicam QE (Cooke Corporation, Romulus, MI) digital CCD camera, motorized z-axis controller (Prior, Rockland, MA) and Slidebook 4.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Three dimensional z stacks (0.5 µM intervals) of three or four chromosome territories per in situ hybridization were collected and deconvolved with a NoNeighbor algorithm in Slidebook 4. Images from each round of labeling were aligned by comparing x,y,z coordinates of landmark refractile structures in corresponding phase contrast using registration software developed in our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Bhattacharya1">[63]</xref> and with imageJ's translation function. This process allows two different sets of images of the same nucleus to be combined into a single image set. Accuracy of matching was then verified by merging of DAPI images from different rounds followed by imageJ's line profile tool.</p>
<p>The chromosome territories were segmented into binary images using ImageJ's threshold feature. Three different criteria were used to distinguish between signal and noise including: (1) algorithms that process the intensity histograms using ImageJ threshold reference isodata; (2) user selection of a narrow range of intensities corresponding to the chromosomes borders; (3) decreasing the threshold until the captured pixels are no longer connected to the chromosome. All three of these criteria result in nearly identical selection of chromosome signals into binary segmented images. Next we developed a program termed <italic>eFISHent</italic> that reconstructs the 3D shapes of CT based on well-known region labeling algorithms to determine the boundary of each CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Gonzalez1">[87]</xref> and subsequently measures many parameters within the nucleus. The eFISHent program then measures in 3-D a large number of parameters including: their volumes, volume overlap between interacting CT, minimal border-to-border distances (pairwise border distances, <italic>PBDs</italic>), distances between centers of gravity (pairwise center distances, <italic>PCDs</italic>), distances between peripheries and centers (<italic>PBCDs</italic>), the distance of the line projecting from the nuclear center through the center of the chromosome/gene to the nuclear periphery (subtended radii, <italic>SR</italic>), minimal peripheral distance to the nuclear periphery (<italic>MPD</italic>), centroid xyz coordinates, and major and minor axes. This program is versatile since it will measure all of these values for any given amount of input objects simultaneously. For example, with 7 chromosomes labeled, as in this study, it will measure the 18 homologs' volumes, the nuclear volume, 252 pairwise heterologous distances (82 PBDs, 82 PCDs, and 82 PBCDs), 21 homologous distances (7 PBDs, 7 PCDs, and 7 PBCDs), 14 subtended radii, 14 MPDs, 14 centroid coordinates, and 28 major/minor axes. For validation we simulated data of known distances and found that our program accurately measures all distance combinations. We also used conventional measurement techniques in imageJ to validate distance measurements made by eFISHent in experimental FISH between BAC probe labeling.</p>
<p>Since the volume determination of each homolog in a CT pair are never exactly the same, this program enables us to distinguish “homolog a” as having a larger volume than “homolog b”. This results in four pairwise distances for each CT (e.g., 1a-2a, 1a-2b, 1b-2a, 1b-2b). Any given nucleus, therefore, will have between 0 to 4 associations for each CT pair. From this data, the percentages of pair-wise associations based on PBD measurements were calculated using a threshold distance of ≤4 pixels or ≤0.28 µM as the minimal nearest 3-D distance for a “positive interaction” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>. ∼90% of these values for each chromosome pair were “zero” pixel values. We have found that all zero pixel values represent a degree of overlap or co-localization between the two CT under measurement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Fritz1">[29]</xref>. Thus the 4 pixel threshold used in these studies for nearest neighbor CT pairs is indicative of interchromosomal interactions and not simply the close proximity of CTs.</p>

<title>Random simulation of nuclei and chromosome territories</title>
<p>While many simulations are done using an artificial nucleus and preset volumes run many times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>, to more accurately mimic the experimental conditions, we have simulated the precise nuclear and CT volumes and shapes for each image set. All images from each given nucleus are contained within its own separate folder. The simulation program reads the volumes of the CT within each CT image, selects a point at random from within the DAPI mask and grows asymmetrically from that point until the volume and shapes similar to the experimental CT in that given nucleus are reached. If a CT reaches the nuclear border it no longer grows in that direction - ensuring that all simulated CT are within the nucleus.</p>

<title>Chromatic median analysis and modeling chromosome territory associations</title>
<p>Previously an algorithm called the generalized median graph (GMG) was developed to determine the probabilistic best fit model for global interactions of chromosome in the Go stage of WI38 human fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Zeitz1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Marella1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Mukherjee1">[88]</xref>. The GMG considered all possible association matrices (i.e., all permutations of the association graphs) and simultaneously optimizes the associations of all CT under consideration. To tackle a larger population of cells with more CT and enhance the theoretical guarantee of the quality of the solution, we have developed a new algorithmic technique termed the <italic>chromatic median</italic> or CM which uses combinatorial optimization to infer the common chromosome interaction pattern or network for the overall cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Ding1">[39]</xref>. While the GMG used integer linear programming and rounding techniques, the CM is more accurate and robust. It is based on a number of new techniques, such as semi-definite programming, multi-level rounding, geometric peeling, and adaptive sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Vandenberghet1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Thompson1">[90]</xref>. The CM technique results in much better approximation ratios and yields near optimal solutions in all tested random or real datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Ding1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Details of the CM technique and its mathematical basis are presented elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003857-Ding1">[39]</xref>. In brief, this approach represents each nucleus as an 14×14 (7 CT for this study, 2 homologs per CT) binary matrix wherein a value of 1 designates an interaction and a value of 0 indicates the lack of an interaction. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s008">Figure S8</xref>. The objective is to find the best permutation (re-categorizing from “a” to “b” and vice versa for all CT pairs within each nucleus) which will align the matrix of each input cell with that of the common pattern. The new CM algorithm considers all possible permutations of the interactions and simultaneously optimizes the interactions of all pairs of heterologs and homologs. For example, if there is a high frequency of nuclei wherein one homolog of CT4 associates with CT12, 16, 18, while the other homolog associates with CT1, 11, and 17, it will classify the first as CT1a and the second as CT1b across all cells. This process is done simultaneously for all CT studied to maximize similarity across the population. The number of input cells which have an interaction is then determined for each of the possible pairwise combinations.</p>
<p>After permutation analysis, the CM gives an output matrix which lists the percent of cells that have that given interaction. Using excel's conditional formatting, each interaction is filled with a color ranging from green (high/hot spots) to red (low/cold spots). Yellow indicates moderate values. After setting a threshold for interactions, probabilistic models are generated of preferred CT interactions among the entire subset of CTs. A simple example of this process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003857.s008">Figure S8</xref>.</p>
