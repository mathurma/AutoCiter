Here we describe a “multi-constraint” protein design protocol to predict sequences optimized for multiple criteria, such as maintaining sets of interactions, and apply it to characterize the mechanism and extent to which 20 multi-specific proteins are constrained by binding to multiple partners. We find that multi-specific binding is accommodated by at least two distinct patterns. In the simplest case, all partners share key interactions, and sequences optimized for binding to either single or multiple partners recover only a subset of native amino acid residues as optimal. More interestingly, for signaling interfaces functioning as network “hubs,” we identify a different, “multi-faceted” mode, where each binding partner prefers its own subset of wild-type residues within the promiscuous binding site. Here, integration of preferences across all partners results in sequences much more “native-like” than seen in optimization for any single binding partner alone, suggesting these interfaces are substantially optimized for multi-specificity. The two strategies make distinct predictions for interface evolution and design. Shared interfaces may be better small molecule targets, whereas multi-faceted interactions may be more “designable” for altered specificity patterns. The computational methodology presented here is generalizable for examining how naturally occurring protein sequences have been selected to satisfy a variety of positive and negative constraints, as well as for rationally designing proteins to have desired patterns of altered specificity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Computational methods have recently led to remarkable successes in the design of molecules with novel functions. These approaches offer great promise for creating highly selective molecules to accurately control biological processes. However, to reach these goals modeling procedures are needed that are able to define the optimal “fitness” of a protein to function correctly within complex biological networks and in the context of many possible interaction partners. To make progress toward these goals, we describe a computational design procedure that predicts protein sequences optimized to bind not only to a single protein but also to a set of target interaction partners. Application of the method to characterize “hub” proteins in cellular interaction networks gives insights into the mechanisms nature has used to tune protein surfaces to recognize multiple correct partner proteins. Our study also provides a starting point to engineer designer molecules that could modulate or replace naturally occurring protein interaction networks to combat misregulation in disease or to build new sets of protein interactions for synthetic biology.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>ELH was supported by a Genentech/Sandler Graduate Fellowship and a training grant from the US National Institutes of Health (GM08284).

It is not well understood how and to what extent protein sequences and structures are optimized for multiple and likely interdependent properties such as stability and efficiency of folding, low propensity for aggregation, and functional characteristics. Protein–protein interaction networks may impose particular pressures on amino acid residues in protein interfaces if each protein needs to maintain correct and avoid unwanted interactions. Not only specificity of interactions but also a defined level of promiscuity may be required, as it is known that many proteins use regions of overlapping interface residues to bind several partners at different points in time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b002">2</xref>].</p><p>Protein design predictions offer great promise to help dissect the structural determinants of the interplay between promiscuity and specificity, as well as to create new molecules that interfere with defined cellular protein–protein interactions with high fidelity and selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b003">3</xref>]. Protein design methodologies have generally focused on choosing an amino acid sequence optimal for a specific criterion, such as protein stability or interaction energy with a single binding partner. These computational design techniques have led to several accomplishments, including the pioneering design of a complete protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b004">4</xref>], of novel protein folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b006">6</xref>], the engineering of catalytic activity into an uncatalytic scaffold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b008">8</xref>], and the redesign of protein–protein interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b012">12</xref>]. Yet, sequences completely redesigned on a known protein fold often differ substantially from naturally occurring sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b004">4</xref>], and the properties of designed proteins can be unusual. Top7, a computationally designed protein with a fold not previously seen in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b006">6</xref>], has a complex folding landscape strikingly different from that of evolved small, single domain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b013">13</xref>]. Thus, if we wish to rationally design new proteins that can be expressed and function correctly in a cellular environment and in the context of many possible interaction partners, it is likely that we will need modeling procedures that are able to consider a variety of requirements defining optimal protein “fitness.”</p><p>Here we focus on the multiple constraints interaction networks may impose on protein interfaces, both to characterize the evolutionary and biophysical principles shaping these networks, and to develop computational design methods to reengineer them. Previous studies have suggested the importance of negative selection to maintain specificity for a single binding partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b014">14</xref>]. Havranek and Harbury developed a negative design strategy selecting against unwanted partners to predict highly specific coiled-coil interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b011">11</xref>]. We extend the idea of incorporating additional selection constraints into computational protein design by examining the inverse problem: how are multiple positive criteria, such as the binding of different partners, accommodated at multi-specific (e.g., promiscuous) protein interfaces?</p><p>We perform two computational experiments on 20 multi-specific proteins. First, we optimize each multi-specific interface sequence to maintain interactions with all known structurally characterized partners (multi-constraint protocol). Second, we predict interface sequences optimal for interacting with each partner individually (single-constraint protocol). We hypothesize that, to the extent that a multi-constraint protocol is a good approximation of pressures acting on promiscuous interfaces, predicted sequences should be more “native-like” when all characterized binding partners are included in the optimization procedure than if only the interaction with a single binding partner is considered. Further, we can compare the differences in interface sequences selected by each partner alone (single-constraint) and all partners considered together (multi-constraint). If multiple pressures play a role for sequence choices, this comparison should highlight which amino acids are compromises among the various outcomes favored by each binding partner individually.</p><p>We show that, overall, inclusion of multiple binding partners during optimization returns sequences closer to those found in native promiscuous interfaces. We find native interface residues predicted to be “hotspots” for each partner remain optimal in the context of optimization for single or multiple partners, while other positions may or may not undergo compromises in order to maintain binding of all partners. These trends resulted in the classification of two broad groups of multi-specific interfaces. In the first group, the number of native residues recovered as optimal was similar for optimizations performed over single or multiple partners. Here, key interactions within the interface appeared to be shared, and there was little evidence of compromise in binding preferences among all partners. In contrast, a second group of multi-specific proteins, including “hubs” such as small GTPases, ubiquitin, and actin, appeared to have optimized large fractions of their interfaces for binding multiple partners. In these cases, each partner appears to pick and choose subsets of the interface to make key interactions with, and integrating differences in the binding preferences over all partners often resulted in the native residues being the “optimal compromise” for maintaining binding of all partners.</p><p>Our method thus both predicts interface sites responsible for multi-specificity and provides an estimate of the magnitude of pressure exerted on sites by each interaction partner. The method we present here can be used as a predictive tool to study how naturally occurring amino acid sequences might have been constrained by any number of positive or negative criteria—including the ability to adopt two different conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b015">15</xref>]—or as a protein design tool to rationally redesign variants of native proteins to have a desired set of properties matching user-defined constraints.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rationale: Test for Optimization and Compromise by Applying Multi- and Single-Constraint Design to Promiscuous Protein Interfaces</title><p>We set out to address two main questions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). First, how optimized are native multi-specific interface sequences for binding multiple partners? It is known that the free energy of binding a single interacting partner is generally not evenly distributed among the native interface residues, but rather some hotspot positions are energetically more important than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b016">16</xref>]. Further, phage display experiments have revealed that substantial sequence plasticity may be tolerated at protein interfaces without significantly destabilizing, and often improving, binding of a single partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b019">19</xref>]. Thus, only a subset of a protein sequence may need to be constrained to native in order for a single criterion to be satisfied, while other sequence positions may be less optimized and tolerate a wider set of amino acid types. We hypothesize that the presence of multiple constraints (e.g., multiple binding partners) might substantially restrict interface sequence space such that only native or near native amino acid residues would be tolerated at most sites in multi-specific interfaces. If this is true, sequences that have been computationally designed to optimize binding with all known interaction partners should be more “native-like” than sequences designed to bind each partner independently. Thus, for each promiscuous protein we examine, we compare the sequence predicted to be optimal by our multi-constraint protocol to the wild-type sequence in order to provide an estimate of how extensively each interface is optimized for multi-specificity (see Test for Optimization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g001">Figure 1</xref>A1). Importantly, differences between predicted and wild-type sequences could highlight that evolved sequences are not necessarily optimized for maximal affinity but that other pressures are at play.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030164-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030164.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Computational Strategy and Methodology Flowchart</title><p>(A) Computational strategy for determining the degree of optimization and predicted cost of multi-specificity.</p><p>(B) Flowchart illustrating the methodology for generating a dataset of multi-specific proteins and computational protocol for predicting sequences optimal for each binding interaction alone (single-constraint) as well as sequences predicted to satisfying binding in the context of all structurally characterized partners (multi-constraint).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030164.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Second, we ask if each binding partner prefers similar interactions throughout the binding site, or if some partners need to make energetic compromises in order for multi-specificity to be maintained. To address this question, we compare sequences computationally designed to bind only one partner at a time (without consideration of the other characterized partners) with the sequence selected as optimal for interacting with all partners (see Estimate Cost in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g001">Figure 1</xref>A2). We reasoned that for a given interface position, if an identical amino acid is chosen when each partner is optimized separately as is selected when all partners are included in the optimization process, key interactions at that site might be highly shared among all partners. In contrast, some single-constraint optimizations might choose an amino acid type different from the one selected in the multi-constraint protocol. For such positions, we can use our scoring function to estimate the degree of compromise occurring between differing preferences seen among the interaction partners.</p><p>We imagined two extreme case scenarios. If all binding partners of a given promiscuous protein prefer similar interface sequences (“shared” scenario), single- and multi-constraint optimizations are expected to give similar results and comparable agreement with wild-type sequences (termed “native sequence recovery”). If only a core set of shared residues is sufficient for binding to all partners, the total native sequence recovery over the entire interface could be low, as the exact amino acid identity of peripheral residues may be less important. Alternatively, each residue in a multi-specific interface could be optimal for only one or few partners (“multi-faceted” scenario). In this case, designed sequences from single-constraint simulations would be expected to resemble the wild-type sequence only for certain positions, and these positions could be different for each partner. The multi-constraint simulations should act to integrate preferences across all partners and would be expected to generate sequences that are more native-like than those resulting from optimization for any single binding partner alone. For this scenario, there could be significant tradeoff between the preferences of differing partners, and amino acid residues within this class of interfaces could be compromises with respect to the amino acid type preferred by some or all partners. However, for each interface position, we hypothesize that there should be an “optimal compromise” that satisfies the constraints imposed by all partners to maintain multi-specific binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Computational Strategy</title><p>Our computational protocol to test for optimization and compromise in multi-specific interfaces outlined above is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g001">Figure 1</xref>B. To determine whether the shared or multi-faceted strategies are used in naturally occurring promiscuous interfaces, we first compiled a dataset of protein complexes from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Each promiscuous protein along with all its structurally characterized binding partners is listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g002">Figure 2</xref>. In total, we examined 65 PDB complexes, each of which included one of 20 multi-specific proteins. While this analysis is inherently limited by the set of promiscuous proteins characterized in the PDB and ignores much known information on biological interactions, it has the advantage that we can rely on high-resolution structural information for each of the complexes, and hence are more likely to obtain reliable predictions from protein design methods. Our dataset of 20 promiscuous proteins is nevertheless quite broad and includes all SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b020">20</xref>] classes (except membrane proteins) as well as representatives from diverse functional families such as signaling proteins (GTPases, CheY), structural proteins (actin), ubiquitin, and several enzymes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Further, in order to estimate the connectivity or number of putative protein–protein interactions for each promiscuous protein in our dataset, we performed a BLAST search against sequences within the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b021">21</xref>]).

About half of the proteins comprised group I (blue shading, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), for which the improvement in native sequence recovery in multi-constraint optimizations over single-constraint optimizations was small and total native amino acid recovery was low, regardless of interface size. As described for the shared scenario above, the low native sequence recovery could be due to all interaction partners binding via a few key residues, with the residues peripheral to these free to vary in sequence. This behavior is likely for several group I proteins including elastase, ovomucoid inhibitor, and the SH3 domain complexes. These proteins bind their targets within a narrow groove or cavity, and in addition a considerable fraction of interactions may be mediated through backbone contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b027">27</xref>]. Low native sequence recovery in group I could also be influenced by inclusion of cross-species interactions (enzyme-inhibitor complexes and interleukin 6 receptor binding to mammalian and viral interleukin) as well as lack of sufficient constraints to fully specify the wild-type sequence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref> below).</p><p>In contrast, for the other half of the proteins in our dataset (group II), sequence optimization over all characterized binding partners resulted in significant improvements in native sequence recovery compared with optimizations for binding to a single partner (pink shading, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Here, as described for the multi-faceted scenario above, the multi-constraint optimization procedure was able to “add up” differing amino acid preferences among partners. The resulting high recovery of native amino acids indicates that binding interfaces for proteins in this group are optimized for multi-specificity. Additionally, as compared with group I, group II proteins tended to use larger and flatter interfaces to mediate binding, were more likely to show high connectivity in protein–protein interactions networks, and bound interaction partners with a greater number of different fold types (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Although generalizations of our conclusions are necessarily limited by the restricted size of our dataset of 20 proteins, a “multi-faceted” recognition pattern spread over a large interface may be a common strategy used by highly connected signaling hubs to bind diverse partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Binding Scores of Sequences Selected by Multiple-Constraint Simulations Are Closer to Native Than Those of Single-Constraint Sequences for Group II Interfaces</title><p>We have shown that for about half the multi-specific proteins in our dataset (group II), the multi-constraint–designed sequences were substantially more native-like than single-constraint sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). According to our rationale outlined above, this suggested a significant level of optimization for multi-specificity in these interfaces. However, not all interface positions were predicted to be native-like, and native sequence recovery over the whole interface in multi-constraint simulations varied between 40% and 71% in this group.</p><p>Non-native amino acids could be chosen by our optimization protocol because they are predicted to be more favorable than the wild-type residue or, alternatively, because a number of different amino acid types are allowed at a certain position without substantial energetic differences. To test whether the non-native interface residues selected by the design simulations were predicted to lead to significant interface stabilization, we compared the binding scores of sequences selected by the single- and multi-constraint protocols with the scores of the wild-type sequences. For both group I and group II, optimization for only a single binding partner always resulted in a favorable decrease in predicted interface binding score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, grey line) relative to the score of the wild-type amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, red line). The binding score patterns for multi-constraint optimizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, black line), however, differed among the two groups: multi-constraint binding scores were often similar to single-constraint scores for group I proteins (compare black and grey lines, blue shaded box), while for group II proteins multi-constraint binding scores were much closer to those calculated for the wild-type sequences (compare black and red lines, pink shaded box).</p><p>The division of our dataset into two groups suggested by the native sequence recovery results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) was thus mirrored in the predicted binding score patterns for wild-type and designed sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Our simulations suggest that for group I proteins, where sequences and binding scores for single- and multi-constraint optimizations were similar, there might be non-native amino acids which could improve the promiscuous compromise and at the same time strengthen each interaction with each binding partner alone. In contrast, non-native amino acids selected for group II proteins in multi-constraint simulations are predicted to offer little improvement over the binding scores of the original wild-type sequences; this confirms our notion of high levels of optimization for multi-specificity in this group. Interestingly, while our simulations sought solely to maximize binding affinity for each partner, and did not explicitly consider either the relative binding affinities among partners or that naturally occurring interfaces often need to be transient, incorporation of multiple constraints alone was often sufficient to predict sequences with binding scores near or identical to that calculated for native sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>For All Multi-Specific Interfaces, Energetically Important Residues Are Generally Optimized for Binding</title><p>We next investigated, on a per-residue basis, at which interface positions our optimization protocols predicted native residues to be suboptimal.

We reasoned that small score differences (&lt;1 score units; scores are parameterized to approximate kcal/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b022">22</xref>]) should reflect that a given optimization protocol recovered the native (or energetically similar to native) residue during optimization, and large score differences (&gt;1 score units) should indicate the extent to which a non-native residue is predicted to improve binding affinity over native.</p><p>At hotspot positions, whether optimizations were performed with respect to single or multiple partners, native (or energetically equivalent) residues were recovered for each partner with high fidelity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g006">6</xref>B, wheat bars, 244/303 and 272/303 for single- and multi-constraint optimizations, respectively). This inability to predict non-native residues scoring better than native at hotspot positions was seen for proteins in both group I and group II (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030164-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, at non-hotspot positions, the native residue was predicted to be suboptimal (yellow, orange, red bars) with respect to binding a single partner in approximately half of all instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, “all other residues”, 350/682). This is in agreement with experimental phage display data showing the native residue to often be suboptimal for binding at non-hotspot positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b019">19</xref>]. When considered in the context of binding multiple partners, however, these same non-hotspot sites often are now predicted to be suboptimal in only 14% of all instances (“All other residues” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g006">Figure 6</xref>B; yellow, orange, red bars 167/682). Thus, we find that the need to maintain multi-specificity imposes constraints primarily on non-hotspot residues. This results in native residues being recovered more often at such sites as they become the “optimal compromise” for binding of multiple partners. This trend for increased recovery of native residues at non-hotspot positions during multi-constraint simulations was much stronger for proteins in group II than in group I (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030164-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030164-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030164.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Distribution of Optimization in Promiscuous Interfaces</title><p>Predicted per-residue binding score improvements (relative to native) for sequences selected in single-constraint (A) and multi-constraint (B) simulations.

For each site within an interface, each partner was assigned a “compromise value” (ranging from 0 to 2). Compromise values were defined as the per-residue difference in score of the amino acid selected when each partner was optimized alone (single-constraint) and the residue selected at the same site when all partners were included in the optimization protocol (multi-constraint).

While we observed a continuum ranging from interfaces calculated to have few completely shared interactions (all GTPases, actin, ubiquitin) to those for which the majority of interactions were shared (inhibitor complexes, SH3 domain), this analysis largely confirmed our earlier grouping of the multi-specific proteins within our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, pink and blue boxes).

These proteins may thus also employ a “multi-faceted” binding strategy, and the low native sequence recovery seen with the multi-constraint protocol is likely due to our computational prediction being under-determined (since we lack structural information for a more complete set of binding partners).

While further analysis is needed, this could indicate strong, shared interactions with core hotspots may be necessary for each partner to bind, but that it is along the rim of the overlapping interface site where compromises among the binding partners have to be integrated in order to maintain multi-specificity. This is reminiscent of the idea that hotspot residues necessary for binding often occur in interface cores sequestered from solvent, whereas other non-hotspot parts of the interface, possibly around the rim, account for recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b016">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Experimental Verification of a Non-Native Residue Predicted Optimal for Multi-Specific Binding</title><p>Our energetic analysis suggests that many positions within naturally occurring multi-specific interfaces have been optimized for binding to multiple partners, while some native amino acids are predicted to be sub-optimal in the context of single or even multiple partners.

We speculate that the “multi-faceted” mode might have an evolutionary advantage for signaling interfaces, as here the chance that single mutations will deleteriously affect <italic>all</italic> binding interactions is reduced. On the other hand, a single mutation may substantially alter the <italic>pattern</italic> of interaction partners by now favoring certain interactions over others. In this way, multi-faceted interfaces may be more “evolvable” for new sets of interactions.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the ability to a priori predict binding sites from surface sequence conservation or surface cavity size has been shown to be easiest for proteins similar to those classified as “shared binding” by our methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b029">29</xref>]. This is consistent with our observations, as in these cases there should be shared evolutionary pressure for conservation of key surface residues by all partners. In contrast, for proteins predicted to display some degree of compromise among the differing binding preferences of their multiple partners, evolutionary pressures could differ depending on which subset of binding partners is most strongly selected for over time. Further, allowing each partner to pick and choose its own subset of interface amino acids for key interactions, as in the multi-faceted case, could necessitate large, easily accessible (i.e., flat) binding surfaces with a certain degree of conformational flexibility; this mechanism could hence partly explain why flat surfaces and conformational variability are frequently seen in multi-specific signaling proteins such as G-proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b030">30</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesize that there should be significant differences in the ease with which binding specificities among partners could be rationally modified and/or small molecule inhibitors could be designed for proteins exhibiting the two modes of multi-specificity described here. The patterns of varying amino acid preferences among different binding partners revealed by comparing the single- and multi-constraint protocols suggest mutations at specific interface positions that could rationally change the specificity or promiscuity seen among binding partners. However, these same factors might make drug or small molecule design toward “multi-faceted” interfaces more difficult. For the group II interfaces in our set, the different partners display varying interface residue preferences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), and there may be a substantial number of constrained residues in each binding interface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030164-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Hence, proteins using this mode of interaction may have fairly distributed hotspots that are difficult to interfere with by a small molecule targeted to a single region.</p><p>A caveat of our study is that first, generalizations may be somewhat limited because of the restricted size of our dataset of high-resolution structures. Second, the results presented here are necessarily dependent on the quality of the scoring function used for optimizations. However, improvement in native recovery seen in multi-constraint simulations could not be directly due to energy function biases, as the same scoring function was used for all simulations. The ability of the Rosetta scoring function to predict energetically important residues has been analyzed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b022">22</xref>]. We note that amino acid types for which our simulations consistently select the native residue as the best (optimal) choice for binding multiple partners include tryptophan, tyrosine, and arginine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030164-sg003">Figure S3</xref>; the predicted amino acid frequencies for W, Y, and R closely match the native distribution), amino acid types which have previously been shown to be energetically important in binding interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b032">32</xref>]. Interestingly, where allowed by steric constraints (for example at the interface periphery), we observed an increased selection in our simulations of larger amino acids such as tryptophan, arginine, and histidine, and against smaller amino acids such as alanine, threonine, and valine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030164-st001">Tables S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030164-st020">S20</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030164-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). While this could be due to approximations in our scoring function, an alternative explanation could be that these non-native sequences would, at least in some cases, truly bind more strongly. An overrepresentation of large hydrophobic residues may have been selected against in nature to maintain protein solubility in the absence of binding partners. In addition, while our computational protocol optimizes binding score, naturally occurring transient interfaces may not necessarily have evolved for strong binding. The complexes between small GTPases and their exchange factors (GEFs) may be examples of interactions that need to be transient to fulfill their cellular function: in the case of the ARF1-Sec7 interaction, the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A inhibits signaling by stabilizing the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b033">33</xref>]. It may also be a general trend that multi-specificity must come at a cost of affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b034">34</xref>]. Additional constraints not explicitly considered in our current protocol, such as selection at the level of on or off rates for complex formation could also account for differences in native and computationally selected sequences.</p><p>Lastly, we note that while the analysis presented here has focused on the ability of our simulations to identify the wild-type amino acid, strict conservation of a single native amino acid over evolutionary time is rare, and the tolerance for substitution to differing amino acid types can vary between sites in an interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b029">29</xref>]. For example, for the multi-specific protein Ras we found two instances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030164-st012">Table S12</xref>, positions 32Y and 67M) where we predicted the interface positions to be energetically important but failed to correctly recover the native amino acid. In both cases, the non-native amino acids selected by our multi-constraint simulations were among the evolutionarily tolerated set seen in a multiple-sequence alignment (unpublished data, generated as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). A clear extension of our method is thus not only to predict optimal but also a set of tolerated amino acid sequences for a given set of constraints (ELH and TK, unpublished data).</p><p>While we have applied the multi-constraint design protocol described in this work to examine whether and how promiscuous proteins are optimized for binding multiple partners, the methodology presented here is general and can be extended to analyze how any number of enumerable constraints (both positive and negative) affects sequence selection. A logical related analysis would be to characterize the sequence determinants of conformational flexibility where the input constraints would be stability for two or more different conformations. Further, the multi-constraint protocol introduced here is not only predictive of naturally occurring amino acid sequences, but also allows for rational redesign of proteins with altered binding properties which could be instrumental toward understand the role of specificity in protein interaction networks as well as in the engineering of biosensors and new cellular pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of a dataset of multi-specific proteins.</title><p>Each domain of every protein–protein interface listed in PIBASE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://alto.compbio.ucsf.edu/pibase/" xlink:type="simple">http://alto.compbio.ucsf.edu/pibase/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030164-b035">35</xref>]) was classified using the standard SCOP domain definition.

For promiscuous proteins with five or more characterized binding partners, only interface positions with an atom within 4 Å of three or more partners were considered. Each single- or multi-constraint optimization allowed all amino acids (except cysteine) to be substituted at each position examined. Positions for which the native residue was a cysteine were disregarded. For all simulations, a genetic algorithm was used to generate and propagate putative sequences based on inter-molecular scores, and optimal rotamers for each sequence were chosen separately with consideration of both inter- and intra-molecular interactions by simulated annealing Metropolis Monte Carlo for each fixed backbone as taken from the PDB. This ensured that in the multi-constraint protocol rotameric conformations could differ among binding partners even as identical interface amino acids were scored for each.</p><p>Simulations were started with an initial random population of 2,000 sequences, and the genetic algorithm was allowed to propagate for 100–200 generations. For single-constraint simulations, fitness was defined to be the inter-molecular score for a single complex while for multi-constraint simulations the fitness was a linear sum of the inter-molecular scores of a given amino acid sequence calculated across all characterized binding partners.
