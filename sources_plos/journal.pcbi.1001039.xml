<p>Evolution maintains organismal fitness by preserving genomic information. This is widely assumed to involve conservation of specific genomic loci among species. Many genomic encodings are now recognized to integrate small contributions from multiple genomic positions into quantitative dispersed codes, but the evolutionary dynamics of such codes are still poorly understood. Here we show that in yeast, sequences that quantitatively affect nucleosome occupancy evolve under compensatory dynamics that maintain heterogeneous levels of A+T content through spatially coupled A/T-losing and A/T-gaining substitutions. Evolutionary modeling combined with data on yeast polymorphisms supports the idea that these substitution dynamics are a consequence of weak selection. This shows that compensatory evolution, so far believed to affect specific groups of epistatically linked loci like paired RNA bases, is a widespread phenomenon in the yeast genome, affecting the majority of intergenic sequences in it. The model thus derived suggests that compensation is inevitable when evolution conserves quantitative and dispersed genomic functions.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Purifying selection is a major force in conserving genomic features. It pushes deleterious mutations to extinction while conserving the specific DNA sequence. Here we show that a large proportion of the yeast genome evolves under compensatory dynamics that conserve genomic properties while modifying the genomic sequence. Such compensatory evolution conserves the local G+C content of the genome, which influences nucleosome organization. Since purifying selection is too weak to eliminate every weakly deleterious mutation in nucleosome bound or unbound sequences, the local G+C content is frequently stabilized by compensatory G+C gaining and G+C losing mutations in proximal loci. Theoretical analysis shows that compensatory evolution is inevitable when natural selection is weak and the genomic feature is distributed over many loci. These results imply that sequence conservation may not always be equated with overall selection. They demonstrate that cycles of weakly deleterious substitutions followed by positive selection for corrective mutations, which were so far studied mostly in RNA coding genes, are observed broadly and profoundly affect genome evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the complete sequencing of a large number of genomes, and with the rapid progress in the development and application of methodologies for functional annotation of whole genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Mikkelsen1">[1]</xref>, it is becoming evident that our basic concepts of genomic function must be updated. The view of genomes as “bags of genes” is challenged by multiple lines of evidence, such as the extensive transcription of short and long RNAs from a substantial fraction of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Guttman1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Birney1">[4]</xref>, and the identification of a dense grid of enhancers and transcription factor binding sites in regions that could not be previously associated with genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Heintzman1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Visel1">[6]</xref>. Some of the properties of the newly emerging genomic encodings are clearly different from the prototypic example of the triplet genetic code. The direct mapping between genomic positions (codons) and function (peptides) which is a hallmark of the genetic code does not seem to hold for the majority of the genome. Instead, genomic encodings integrate small contributions from multiple positions to form complex and quantitative outcomes. These types of <italic>dispersed encodings</italic> may be involved in defining enhancer sequences, maintaining epigenomic switches, affecting widespread transcription, and contributing to chromosome structure and dynamics. The evolutionary implications of these new types of codes are still poorly understood. The classical models in molecular evolution assume fitness to be a function of a single evolving locus. Conservation of the function encoded by such a locus is quantitatively predicted to decrease its rate of evolution. What rates of evolution can be expected when each of the multiple positions have small contributions to some joint quantitative fitness?</p>
<p><italic>Neutral compensatory substitutions</italic> were predicted by Kimura 25 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kimura1">[7]</xref> to couple substitutions in pairs of interacting protein coding loci. Kimura's concept was that an evolving population trajectory may visit suboptimal fitness levels transiently, thereby invoking an adaptive corrective force that can bring the system back to optimality. Such a process will change the genomic sequence, fixating pairs of compensatory alleles. Kimura's compensatory dynamic may work in any group of loci that are associated with an epistatic (non linear fitness function) constraint and was quantified extensively in RNA coding loci where the epistatic coupling of paired loci has a clear structural interpretation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kirby1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Stephan1">[10]</xref>. Another important source of genomic information, transcription factor binding sites, poses evolution with a different type of epistatic constraint by forming a quantitative binding energy landscape that affects gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tanay1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Bradley1">[12]</xref>. The evolution of binding sites was shown to drive compensatory effects at the single site level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Doniger1">[13]</xref> and also at the level of binding site clusters (or enhancers) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Doniger1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Lusk1">[14]</xref>. Studies of enhancer evolution are continuously providing striking examples for plasticity and compensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Ludwig1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tanay2">[17]</xref>, but due to their heterogeneity, it is currently difficult to develop a general understanding of their evolutionary dynamics.</p>
<p>A simple experimentally characterized example of a dispersed genomic encoding involves the effect of DNA sequence on nucleosome organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Satchwell1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Segal1">[19]</xref>. <italic>In-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Yuan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kaplan1">[21]</xref> and other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Mavrich1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Schones1">[24]</xref> showed that nucleosomal packaging is correlated with preferential binding of nucleosomes to specific dinucleotide periodicities, and is strongly anti-correlated with A+T content in general and with poly(A/T) sequences in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Yuan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Lee1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Segal2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Field1">[26]</xref>. The correlation between nucleosome occupancy and the underlying DNA sequence is sufficiently powerful to allow sequence based nucleosome occupancy prediction, but this prediction is not based on a strict requirement for certain nucleotides to appear at precise positions. Rather, information from multiple sequence positions along the 147bp length of the nucleosome contributes to the affinity of nucleosomes to a given sequence and consequently, to the formation of stable or semi-stable nucleosome configurations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Segal3">[27]</xref>. The evolution of these sequence determinants thus serves as a test case for the dynamics of dispersed genomic encodings. Analysis of substitution rates in yeast suggested that genomic sequences that are unbound to nucleosomes are evolving slower than genomic sequences that are bound to nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Yuan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Washietl1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Babbitt1">[30]</xref>. Whether this is an indication of classical purifying selection on nucleosome encoding sequences, increased abundance of transcription factor (TF) binding sites at low nucleosome occupancy loci, or nucleosome-associated mutability, is currently unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Sasaki1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we analyze patterns of divergence and polymorphisms in yeast intergenic sequences to substantiate an extended model of selection on a dispersed genomic encoding. The analysis shows that yeast low nucleosome occupancy sequences have maintained a high A+T content throughout the evolution of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> lineage. Contrary to standard evolutionary models, we show that this conservation was made possible not by pointwise sequence conservation, but by a compensatory coupling of decreased rates of A/T-losing substitutions and increased rates of corrective A/T-gaining substitutions. Theoretical analysis suggests that this type of evolutionary dynamics is largely unavoidable when the genome employs dispersed functional encodings. The evolutionary dynamics we reveal shuffle sequences continuously while preserving their encoded function, creating a dynamic yet balanced process that may be central to the evolution of gene regulation.</p>

<title>Regional heterogeneity in nucleotide composition is correlated with yeast nucleosome occupancy</title>
<p>The global G+C content of the yeast intergenic genome is about 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g001"><bold>Fig 1A</bold></xref>) but there is a significant heterogeneity in the genome local nucleotide composition (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s001">Fig S1</xref></bold>). Such heterogeneity must be the consequence of a variable evolutionary process working in G+C poor and G+C rich sequences. Recently it was shown that nucleosome occupancy patterns strongly correlate with local G+C content in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tillo1">[32]</xref>. We define <italic>high nucleosome occupancy loci</italic> as those in the top 21% MNase-seq coverage percentiles <italic>in-vivo</italic> (total 540 kbp, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g001"><bold>Fig</bold> <bold>1B</bold></xref>), and <italic>low nucleosome occupancy loci</italic> as those in the bottom 14% MNase-seq coverage percentiles <italic>in-vivo</italic> (total 350 kbp). Overall, the intergenic G+C content at high occupancy sequences (∼40% G+C) is higher than the G+C content of low occupancy sequences (∼28% G+C). This heterogeneity is even more pronounced when studying the distribution of tri-nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g001"><bold>Fig 1C</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s002">Fig S2</xref></bold>), showing A/T tri-nucleotides to be more abundant in low occupancy sequences, and pointing towards additional nucleosome sequence preferences. It was shown before that <italic>in-vitro</italic> nucleosome occupancy can be robustly predicted from the distribution of 5-mers or even 3-mers in the sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>. This suggests that the functionality and fitness contribution of DNA-encoded nucleosome organization, if such a contribution exists, is dispersed across multiple loci in a quantitative fashion and is not encoded by a strict requirement for precise sequence elements at one or a few positions. To prove or disprove the hypothesis that yeast intergenic G+C content heterogeneity is affected by nucleosome-related selection, we studied the evolutionary dynamics of yeast sequences bound and unbound to nucleosomes. We hypothesized that through characterization of these dynamics, we may reveal, in addition to the sequence constraints affecting yeast nucleosome organization, some general principles governing the evolution of dispersed genomic encodings.</p>

<title>Analysis of context-dependent substitution rates reveals correlation between nucleosome occupancy and evolutionary dynamics</title>
<p>To study the evolutionary dynamics that underlie G+C content heterogeneity and nucleosome occupancy in the yeast genome, we inferred substitution rates and ancestral sequences in the <italic>Saccharomyces sensu stricto</italic> clade. We performed evolutionary inference from alignments of five yeast genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Cliften1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kellis1">[34]</xref> for sequences that were classified as high nucleosome occupancy loci in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> We separately inferred the evolutionary trajectory at low nucleosome occupancy loci. The analysis omitted exonic sequences, since the evolutionary dynamics in these involve additional sources of selection relative to those affecting intergenic sequences. Differences in locus mutability are known to be associated with the flanking nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Siepel1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Hwang1">[36]</xref>, and this effect may severely bias the comparison of evolutionary dynamics between regions with different nucleotide composition. For example, A+T rich regions, like low-occupancy sequences, may exhibit slower divergence of A/T nucleotides than G+C rich regions, simply because A/T mutability is reduced in the flanking context of A/T nucleotides. To account for this effect of flanking nucleotides on substitution dynamics, we independently estimated the rate of substitution at all 16 possible combinations of flanking nucleotides. Indeed, the substitution rates estimated by our model vary significantly among flanking contexts both in high and low occupancy loci and reflect context-dependency that is consistent among phylogenetic lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g002"><bold>Fig 2A</bold></xref>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s003">Fig S3</xref></bold>). For example, the C to T transition rate over the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineage in low occupancy regions varies between ∼0.14 in the context of tCc and ∼0.03 in the gCg context. The estimation of context-dependent substitution rates proved essential for the unbiased comparison of evolutionary dynamics between the low occupancy, G+C poor, and the high occupancy, G+C rich sequences. As we show next, it allowed us to robustly identify and validate major differences in the evolutionary regimes of these two classes of loci.</p>

<title>Low occupancy sequences lose A/T nucleotides slowly and gain them in a context-dependent fashion. A) Yeast substitution rates are robustly correlated with the flanking nucleotides.</title>
<p>Shown are the inferred C to T substitution rates for the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineage (X-axis), and other <italic>sensu stricto</italic> lineages (color coded, Y-axis). Each point represents the C to T substitution rate in one of 4x4 different flanking nucleotide contexts which are defined using the 5′ and 3′ nucleotides depicted on top. The data reveal a four-fold variation in substitution rates at different contexts, which is consistent among the different lineages (as shown by the fit between the independently inferred substitution rates of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and of the other lineages). Controlling for this variation is important when comparing substitution dynamics in A+T rich vs. A+T poor genomic regions, such as low and high occupancy sequences. <bold>B) Different evolutionary dynamics in low and high occupancy loci.</bold> Shown are log-ratios of substitution rates in low vs. high occupancy sequences (Y-axis) plotted against the substitution rates at high occupancy sequences (X-axis). Each point represents the rate of one of four types of substitutions (color coded) in loci flanked by the 5′ and 3′ nucleotide depicted inside the data point. Substitutions in reverse complementary contexts are averaged and shown only once. A/T-losing substitutions (red, pink) are ∼45% slower in low occupancy loci, an effect that is observed independently for transitions and transversions across the different flanking sequence contexts. A/T-gaining substitutions (blue, cyan) are highly dependent on the context, with the main group having rates which are independent of the nucleosome occupancy and with A/T gains in G/C flanking contexts highly conserved in low occupancy sequences. <bold>C) Averaged substitution trends.</bold> Shown are overall rates of A/T-gaining and A/T-losing substitutions in high and low nucleosome occupancy (occ.) averaged over all contexts. The simplified divergence pattern is difficult to explain using standard models of selection, since different types of substitution are differentially affected. <bold>D) The S. cerevisiae lineage maintained the G+C content of low and high occupancy sequences.</bold> Shown are the average G+C content in the extant <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome and in the inferred common ancestor of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, depicted for 10 levels of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).

<title>Low occupancy sequences lose A/T nucleotides slowly but gain A/T nucleotides at the same rate as high occupancy sequences</title>
<p>We first studied <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> substitution rates inferred from intergenic sequences within 200 bp of annotated transcription start sites. It is known that this region in yeast promoters is enriched for transcription factor binding sites and exhibits a stereotyped nucleosome-depleted region of length ∼100–150 bp. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g002"><bold>Fig 2B–C</bold></xref> (see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s004">Fig S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s005">Fig S5</xref></bold>), the analysis reveals that the rates of A/T-losing transitions (A to G, T to C) and transversions (A to C, T to G) are ∼45% lower in low occupancy sequences than in high occupancy sequences. A decrease is observed for all 16 nucleotide contexts (within an estimation variance), and is slightly more pronounced in A/T contexts (AAA, AAT). Notably, the rates of A/T-gaining transitions (G to A, C to T) and transversions (G to T, C to A) are not decreased like the A/T-losing substitutions. In most sequence contexts, the rates of A/T-gaining substitutions are higher in low occupancy sequences or similar between the sequence classes. On the other hand, when flanked by G's or C's, the rates of A/T-gaining substitutions are four times slower in low occupancy compared to high occupancy sequences. Evolutionary theory could not predict these dynamics if the evolution of G+C content was neutral (unless an extremely unlikely mutational regime is separating high from low occupancy regions, as we disprove below using population genetics data). Moreover, a simple theory assuming average stronger evolutionary constraint on low occupancy sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Yuan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Warnecke1">[29]</xref> would predict a general decrease in the substitution rates in the region and would not explain the asymmetry between A/T-gaining and A/T-losing substitution rates.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Overall G+C content is conserved for high and low nucleosome occupancy DNA</title>
<p>An important assumption underlying our evolutionary analysis above is that the evolutionary regime operating in regions that are occupied (or unoccupied) by nucleosomes in the extant <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome has been the same since the divergence of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>. Violations of this assumption can potentially affect our substitution rate estimations. For example, if nucleosome occupancy is determined by the genomic sequence, but is not under selection, nucleosomes may drift freely following substitutions spontaneously generating new A+T rich hotspots. Following that, we may enrich for substitutions that increase A+T content in extant low occupancy sequences by assuming nucleosome organization were conserved. To verify that such a scenario has not significantly affected our analysis of TSS-proximal substitution rates, we inferred the G+C content in the common ancestor of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, for 10 ranges of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nucleosome occupancy levels, and compared it to the extant G+C content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g002"><bold>Fig 2D</bold></xref>). We found that the G+C content at all levels of nucleosome occupancy did not change significantly during evolution in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineage. Sequences proximal to TSSs therefore conserve their regional G+C content (at least on average). Consequently, the different rates of substitutions in high and low nucleosome occupancy loci do not represent net divergence in the sequence features that correlates with nucleosome occupancy. This is further confirmed by recent comparative analysis of nucleosome organization in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, which revealed only limited divergence in nucleosome positioning for these species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tsankov1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tirosh1">[38]</xref>. The highly non symmetric substitution dynamics observed at different levels of nucleosome occupancy must therefore be explained by means of a stationary evolutionary process that conserves the underlying nucleosome-associated encoding.</p>

<title>Spatial coupling between A/T-losing and A/T-gaining substitutions suggests compensatory evolution preserves high and low occupancy sequences</title>
<p>One intriguing possibility that may explain the asymmetry between the rates of A/T-losing and A/T-gaining substitutions in low occupancy sequences is that while A/T-losing mutations are selected against, some can be sustained in the population. Consequently, positive selection is able to push to fixation corrective A/T-gaining mutations (possibly at different genomic positions). If this hypothesis is correct, we can predict that loci near sites of A/T-losing substitutions will be enriched with A/T-gaining substitutions and vice versa. Remarkably, the yeast divergence patterns confirm this prediction. The data reveal that rates of A/T-gaining substitution are accelerated next to sites of observed A/T loss (compared to rates near conserved loci, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g003"><bold>Fig 3A</bold></xref>). Furthermore, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g003"><bold>Fig 3A</bold></xref>, this effect does not represent general spatial coupling of substitutions, since the A/T gain rate is significantly higher near sites of A/T loss than it is near sites of A/T gain. Conversely, the rates of A/T losing substitutions are higher next to sites of observed A/T gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g003"><bold>Fig 3B</bold></xref>). Unexpectedly, this coupling effect is observed robustly across the entire spectrum of nucleosome occupancy levels (p&lt;1e-5 for high nucleosome occupancy, p&lt;0.04 for low nucleosome occupancy). The coupling between contrasting substitutions on spatially linked loci suggests the involvement of a common selective constraint, without which the dynamics at these loci must be independent of each other. The data therefore suggest that compensating A/T-losing and A/T-gaining mutations work to conserve a heterogeneous G+C content (both high and low) in TSS-proximal sequences.</p>

<title>Compensation and possible divergence of low occupancy regions revealed by the substitution dynamics at TSS-distal sequences</title>
<p>The trinucleotide distributions of low occupancy TSS-distal sequences (over 200 bp from an annotated TSS) are generally similar to those in TSS-proximal loci, but some important differences are notable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g004"><bold>Fig 4A</bold></xref>). First, for low occupancy sequences, G/C trinucleotides are rarer in TSS-distal than in TSS-proximal loci. Second, poly-A/T trinucleotides are enriched relative to other A/T rich nucleotides in TSS-proximal but not TSS-distal low occupancy loci.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g004"><bold>Fig 4B–C</bold></xref>, TSS-distal A/T-losing substitution rates are decreased in low occupancy vs. high occupancy sequences, consistent with the observations in TSS-proximal loci. Furthermore, the rates of A/T-gaining substitution in many contexts are increased in low occupancy vs. high occupancy sequences, similar to their behavior in TSS-proximal regions (but with G/C-flanking contexts not highly conserved). Comparison of the ancestral and extant G+C content reveals conservation at high levels of nucleosome occupancy, but some average decrease in G+C content for low nucleosome occupancy loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g004"><bold>Fig 4D</bold></xref>).

<p>The data therefore support a compensatory substitution process that drives G+C content conservation in most TSS-distal loci, in a way analogous to the dynamics at TSS-proximal loci. This is demonstrated by the asymmetric rates of A/T gain and A/T loss, the conservation of G/C content and the compensatory substitution coupling at most ranges of nucleosome occupancy. An exception to this general trend is observed at some of the TSS-distal low occupancy loci. We hypothesize that during the evolution of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineage, de-novo A/T-rich hotspots may have driven divergence of nucleosome organization in some TSS-distal loci (possibly since these were under weaker selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tsankov1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tirosh1">[38]</xref>). This effect may explain the non-stationary G+C content and spatial clustering of A/T-gaining substitutions at extant TSS-distal low occupancy loci (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s007">Fig S7</xref></bold>). Taken together, the data on TSS-distal sequences further support the idea that selection maintains heterogeneous G+C content across most yeast intergenic sequences (and in particular at TSS-proximal sequences), and that this selection drives changes in substitution rates that are difficult to explain using models of selection on a single locus.</p>

<title>A theoretical model recapitulates the empirical yeast evolutionary dynamics</title>
<p>To study the hypothesis that selection on dispersed nucleosome encodings drives asymmetric substitution patterns in yeasts, we devised a simple theoretical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g005"><bold>Fig 5</bold></xref>). We assume that a population of 20 bp sequences (each representing a different “genome”) is evolving given a constant flux of mutations in some fitness landscape that depends only on the G+C content of the sequence. The mutations transform G/C nucleotides to A/T nucleotides faster than they transform A/Ts to G/Cs, driving the genomes' stationary G+C content to a neutral level of 30%. Working against this stationary G+C content, the fitness landscape defines a lower G+C content (20%) as optimal, with symmetrically decreasing fitness for suboptimal values. This landscape is designed to approximate the potential selective pressure on low nucleosome occupancy sequences. We studied the model behavior at various selection intensities both analytically and using computer simulations (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). For each intensity level, we determined the A/T gain and A/T loss substitution rates and stationary G/C content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g005"><bold>Fig 5A–D</bold></xref>). When selection is weak, the dynamics we observed are neutral, with the rates of substitutions being equal to the rates of mutations, and the G+C content converging to the neutral stationary G+C content (30%). In contrast, when selection is strong, the rates of both A/T gain and A/T loss decrease to zero and the G+C content is optimal (20%). These two regimes are compatible with the standard evolutionary theory of selection on a single locus. More notable are the substitution rates observed at intermediate levels of selection. When selection is not sufficiently strong to purify all A/T-losing mutations, A/T-losing substitution rates are only partially decreased. Interestingly, this decrease is matched by an <italic>increase</italic> in the rate of A/T-gaining substitutions to levels higher than the neutral rate. The new balance between A/T-losing and A/T-gaining rates is sufficient to stabilize the G+C content of the regime at near-optimal levels. Detailed analysis reveals that the increase in the rate of A/T-gaining substitutions is driven by cycles of A/T-loss mutation at one position, which are corrected by an A/T-gain mutation at another position. Similar but opposite dynamics are observed when the optimal G/C content is higher than the neutral one (modeling selection of high G+C content in high nucleosome occupancy sequences, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s008">Fig S8</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the compensatory regime is observed over a much wider range of selection intensities when the fitness landscape is more tolerant as shown, for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g005"><bold>Fig 5E–I</bold></xref>. These theoretical predictions are consistent with the empirical behavior observed in yeast, showing that weak selection can be sufficiently powerful to increase specific substitution rates over the neutral level due to a compensatory regime.</p>

Selection may not be sufficiently powerful to purge every deviation from the optimum and mutations that decrease A/T content may persist (even partially) in the population. These mutations trigger adaptive evolution of corrective mutations, which is efficient since it can occur at multiple positions. The schematic shown here assumes evolution in the threshold fitness landscape (E–H), in which A/T gaining substitutions are never deleterious and therefore robustly increased in rate even if selection is intensive. A variation of the same argument shows why A/T gain rate increases in the fitness landscape of A–D.</p>

<title>Compensatory dynamics are supported by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> polymorphism data</title>
<p>Our evolutionary analysis above supports the idea that high and low nucleosome occupancy sequences in yeast evolve under a selective pressure to maintain their G+C content, or a refined nucleosome sequence potential that is approximated by the average G+C content. According to this scenario, in low occupancy sequences, which are generally A+T-rich, A/T-losing substitutions are weakly selected against, while A/T-gaining substitutions are frequently pushed to fixation by an adaptive force. According to our simulations and to the standard population genetics theory, such selection on A/T-gaining and A/T-losing mutations should affect the distribution of allele frequencies in the population. In low occupancy loci, A/T-losing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are expected to have lower allele frequencies than A/T-neutral SNPs, while A/T-gaining SNPs should have higher allele frequencies. Analysis of polymorphic sites in a sample of 39 <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Liti1">[39]</xref> confirmed these predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g006"><bold>Fig 6</bold></xref>). We used data on 9185 SNPs in low occupancy loci and 16956 SNPs in high occupancy loci, approximating the minor allele frequency using majority voting and discarding sites with incomplete data or more than two alleles. In low occupancy loci, A/T-losing SNPs are more rare (&lt;20%, alternative threshold generated similar results, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001039.s009">Fig S9</xref></bold>) than A/T-gaining SNPs in non G/C flanking context (p&lt;2e–05). A reciprocal effect is observed at high occupancy loci, where A/T-gaining SNPs are more rare than A/T-losing SNPs in non G/C flanking context (p&lt;3e–07). The reciprocality of the effect also confirms that our conclusions are not affected by general biases in the estimation of allele frequencies due to systematic sequencing errors. We note that as expected by the low divergence of A/T nucleotides in G/C flanking contexts of low occupancy sequences, the allele frequencies of A/T-gaining SNPs in such loci are reflective of stronger selection. This may be related to the enrichment of such flanking contexts at TF binding sites, as we discuss below.</p>

<title>The evolutionary origins of G+C content heterogeneity in yeast intergenic regions</title>
<p>We classified yeast intergenic regions according to their nucleosome occupancy, and used evolutionary analysis of context-dependent substitution rates to reveal remarkable variability in the evolutionary dynamics of sequences bound and unbound to nucleosomes. Our analysis shows that low occupancy sequences lose A/T nucleotides slowly compared to high occupancy sequences, but gain A/T nucleotides at similar rates. We also observe spatial coupling between substitutions that gain A/Ts and substitutions that lose them, which suggests that a compensatory process preserves G+C content at both high and low occupancy loci. These observations are compatible with a model in which the local G+C content in yeast is conserved through weak quantitative selection. Such weak selection allows occasional fixation of substitutions that disrupt the optimal G+C content of the region, but then respond by adaptive evolution of corrective mutations at the mutated locus or at any of the surrounding genomic positions. Data on allele frequencies of yeast SNPs independently confirm the predictions of such a model. This set of observations proves that the G+C heterogeneity of yeast intergenic sequences is not a consequence of a neutral process and suggests that nucleosome organization may play a major role in this lack of neutrality.</p>

<title>Selection and the signals for nucleosome organization</title>
<p>The role of DNA encoded nucleosome occupancy in regulating gene expression is difficult to isolate experimentally, mostly due to the challenge of separating cause and effect inside the complex system involving nucleosomes, remodeling factors and TFs. Previous analysis identified an anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and genomic conservation in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Yuan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Washietl1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Babbitt1">[30]</xref> putting forward the hypothesis that low occupancy regions (nucleosome free regions, linkers) may be under selection, either due to their increased frequency of TF binding sites, or since they serve as anchors that organize the entire nucleosome landscape. According to our analysis nucleosome occupancy is tightly correlated with substitution patterns reminiscent of selection throughout the genome and not just at low occupancy regions. The data therefore strongly support the non-negligible contribution of DNA encoded nucleosome organization to fitness and therefore to genome regulation. This is further demonstrated by contrasting the G+C content related selection patterns at TSS-proximal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g002"><bold>Fig 2</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g003"><bold>3</bold></xref>), with the frequent cases of overall divergence of A/T rich hotspots and clustered A/T-gaining substitution in TSS-distal low occupancy sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g004"><bold>Fig 4</bold></xref>). The data suggest that when selection is not working, nucleosome occupancy drifts following changes in the encoding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tsankov1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tirosh1">[38]</xref>. We note that according to our simulations and the empirical data, the selection on nucleosomal sequences must be weak, driven by the very small (but still specific) fitness contribution of any individual genomic position. We predict that such selection is sufficiently powerful to contribute significantly to the heterogeneity of the yeast intergenic sequences, but it is clearly much weaker (per base) than the selection working to conserve classical functional elements. These theoretical considerations underline the difficulty in proving the functionality of specific nucleosome positioning sequences using direct genetics experiments, which typically require large and easily quantifiable phenotypic effects for specific genetic manipulations.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Combined selection on TF binding sites and nucleosome positioning sequences in TSS-proximal low occupancy sequences</title>
<p>One source of evolutionary constraint on yeast intergenic sequences is their interaction with transcription factors. TF binding sites are known to be conserved among yeast species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Cliften1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kellis1">[34]</xref> and their increased concentration in TSS-proximal nucleosome free regions was previously proposed to impose overall conservation at these regions. According to our inferred evolutionary dynamics at TSS-proximal DNA, selection on TF binding sites indeed contributes to the evolution of low occupancy sequences. This is indicated, for example, by a very low A/T gain rates in G/C trinucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g002"><bold>Fig 2</bold></xref>), which are part of some of the most abundant and conserved yeast binding sites (e.g., Ume6, PAC, Reb1, MBP1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tanay1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Bradley1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-MacIsaac1">[40]</xref>. Nevertheless, selection on binding sites, even those that are A/T rich (e.g. TATA boxes) is highly unlikely to explain the nucleosome occupancy-dependent substitution rates we observed throughout the yeast genome. Specifically, the compensatory coupling of A/T-losing and A/T-gaining substitutions is not compatible with any particular binding site model. We therefore hypothesize that a combination of purifying selection on TF binding sites (either strong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Cliften1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kellis1">[34]</xref> or weak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Tanay1">[11]</xref>) and composite selection on DNA encoded nucleosome organization together define a complex fitness landscape that shapes the evolution of yeast intergenic sequences.</p>

<title>Evolution of dispersed sequence encodings necessitates compensatory dynamics</title>
<p>We studied here a model of evolution as manipulating sequences in a complex fitness landscape that combines contributions from multiple coupled loci into a single <italic>dispersed encoding</italic>. As shown by theoretical and empirical analysis of the model, when selection on each individual locus is weak, purifying selection is incapable of completely purging mutations that are only slightly deleterious and these are continuously challenging the overall optimality of the sequence. This suboptimality is compensated effectively by adaptive evolution at multiple other loci that participate in the dispersed encoding. In contrast to other cases of compensatory evolution (proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Poelwijk1">[41]</xref> or RNA molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kirby1">[8]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Stephan1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Meer1">[42]</xref>), the encodings we studied here provide ample direct ways to correct a slightly deleterious substitution, thereby increasing the rate of compensation. Our study builds on earlier work on codon bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Akashi1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Li1">[44]</xref>, but uses the global and experimentally characterized sequence classes at high and low nucleosomes occupancy loci to establish compensatory evolution as a major driving force in evolution under multi-site selection. This type of evolutionary dynamics may be generalized to other dispersed functional encodings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Taylor1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Haag1">[46]</xref> including complex regulatory switches that typically involve a large number of TF binding sites of variable factors and specificities. The remarkably global nature of the compensatory effect we observed in yeast, which cause a measurable global increase in the substitution rate of specific mutations, supports the notion of an evolutionary process that conserves function without a strict requirement to conserve sequence. It is tempting to speculate that such a process may allow genomes to maintain diversity and continuously search the sequence space, without significantly compromising their existing regulatory circuits. Furthermore, this process may reduce, through compensation, the mutational load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Brger1">[47]</xref> resulting from the use of multiple loci to encode regulatory functions.</p>

<title>Estimation of substitution rates</title>
<p>As described in the text, a refined context dependent substitution model is essential for the correct estimation of the different evolutionary dynamics in low G+C content, low occupancy loci and high G+C content, high occupancy loci. We therefore applied a flexible substitution model to perform ancestral inference and learn evolutionary parameters from alignment data (details available upon request). The model included parameters for the substitution rates at each of 16 possible contexts parameterized by the identities of the 3′ and 5′ flanking nucleotides. Independent substitution rates were assumed for each lineage in a phylogenetic tree which was fixed throughout the process. We note that the model does not assume parametric constraints on different substitution rates, and infers substitution rates on lineages, rather than a global substitution rate matrix and branch lengths. This approach has proved more robust given that a sufficient number of loci was available to learn robustly the parameters at each lineage, and given that the substitution process in the different lineages indicated gradual changes in dynamics that a model using a universal rate matrix could not have accounted for (for example, the extant G+C content in each of the species we used show some variability).</p>
<p>To perform ancestral inference, we used a customized loopy belief propagation algorithm on a factor graph approximation of the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001039-Kschischang1">[51]</xref>.

<p>We then identified all positions with A/T divergence &lt;-0.9 (A/T losing contexts), with A/T divergence &gt;0.9 (A/T gaining contexts) and with conserved A/T content (background). For each such set we computed the probability of A/T gain and A/T loss substitutions using the same inferred posterior probabilities. By using this approach (conditional probability given the events in the preceding 5 bp) we ensured each substitution is counted precisely once. By computing the probabilities for similar events (e.g. A/T gain) given different contexts (A/T losing, A/T gaining, or background), we could robustly asses compensation patterns while controlling for the different basal rates of A/T gain and A/T loss and the general clustering of substitution in the genome.</p>

All other SNPs were defined as A/T conserving (see illustration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g006">Fig 6</xref>). We further subdivided SNPs into two groups: SNP's in G/C flanking context and SNP's with at least one A or T in the flanking contexts, using the reference strain for determining the context. These subgroups are again subdivided to SNP's within low occupancy sequences and SNP's within high occupancy sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001039-g006"><bold>Fig 6</bold></xref>).

A-B) Shown are log ratios of trinucleotide frequencies in low and high occupancy sequences (Y axis) against trinucleotide frequencies in high occupancy sequences (X axis) over TSS proximal sequences (A) and TSS distal sequences (B). Each trinucleotide is depicted by three adjacent color coded squares. Pairs of reverse complimented trinucleotides are averaged and depicted together. In addition to the clear preference of A/T trinucleotides for low occupancy sequences (notice the abundant AAA), we note the differences in G/C trinculeotide preferences between the occupancy groups. (C,D) shown are the log ratios of trinucleotide frequencies (same as A,B) over TSS proximal sequences (C) and TSS distal sequences (D).</p>

<p>Yeast substitution rates are robustly correlated with the flanking nucleotides for all substitution types. Shown are the inferred substitution rates in TSS distal low occupancy sequences for the S. cerevisiae lineage (the gray lineage, x axis), and other sensu stricto lineages (color coded, Y axis), for 16 different flanking nucleotide contexts. The linear fit (dashed line) slopes for each lineage is roughly proportional to its branch length, but the model allows for differences in the substitution rates among lineages.

<p>Parsimonious inference validates substitution rates heterogeneity and spatial coupling of A/T gain and loss events. A–B) Shown are A/T gain (blue) and A/T loss (red) substitution rates of the S. cerevisiae lineage inferred using parsimony (flanking context independent). Data is shown for TSS distal (A) and proximal (B) DNA sequences of S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus and S. mikatae. A/T losing rate is ∼50% decreased in low occupancy compared to high occupancy.
