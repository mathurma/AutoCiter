<abstract>
<p>Inputs to signaling pathways can have complex statistics that depend on the environment and on the behavioral response to previous stimuli. Such behavioral feedback is particularly important in navigation. Successful navigation relies on proper coupling between sensors, which gather information during motion, and actuators, which control behavior. Because reorientation conditions future inputs, behavioral feedback can place sensors and actuators in an operational regime different from the resting state. How then can organisms maintain proper information transfer through the pathway while navigating diverse environments? In bacterial chemotaxis, robust performance is often attributed to the zero integral feedback control of the sensor, which guarantees that activity returns to resting state when the input remains constant. While this property provides sensitivity over a wide range of signal intensities, it remains unclear how other parameters such as adaptation rate and adapted activity affect chemotactic performance, especially when considering that the swimming behavior of the cell determines the input signal. We examine this issue using analytical models and simulations that incorporate recent experimental evidences about behavioral feedback and flagellar motor adaptation. By focusing on how sensory information carried by the response regulator is best utilized by the motor, we identify an operational regime that maximizes drift velocity along chemical concentration gradients for a wide range of environments and sensor adaptation rates. This optimal regime is outside the dynamic range of the motor response, but maximizes the contrast between run duration up and down gradients. In steep gradients, the feedback from chemotactic drift can push the system through a bifurcation. This creates a non-chemotactic state that traps cells unless the motor is allowed to adapt. Although motor adaptation helps, we find that as the strength of the feedback increases individual phenotypes cannot maintain the optimal operational regime in all environments, suggesting that diversity could be beneficial.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The biased random walk is a fundamental strategy used by many organisms to navigate their environment. Drift along the desired direction is achieved by reducing the probability to reorient whenever conditions improve. In the chemotaxis system of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, this is accomplished with a sensory module that implements negative integral feedback control, the output of which is relayed to the flagellar motors (the actuators) by a response regulator to control the probability to change direction. The proper dynamical coupling between sensor and actuator is critical for the performance of the random walker. Here, we identify an optimal regime for this coupling that maximizes drift velocity in the direction of the gradient in multiple environments. Our analysis reveals that feedback of the behavior onto the system in steep gradients can constrain individual cell performance, by causing bi-stable behavior that can trap cells in non-chemotactic states. These limitations are inherent in the biased random walk strategy with integral feedback control, but can be alleviated if the output of the pathway adapts, as recently characterized for the flagellar motors in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells navigate their environment by alternating straight runs with direction-changing tumbles to perform a random walk. During a run, the flagellar motors spin counterclockwise (CCW) and propel the cell at constant speed in one direction, which changes slowly due to rotational diffusion. Runs are terminated when one or more motors start rotating clockwise (CW), which causes the cell to tumble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Berg1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Min1">[3]</xref>. Cells are able to bias their random walk toward favorable conditions using a two-component signal transduction pathway that detects changes in signal intensity during runs and modulates the probability to tumble accordingly, resulting in extended runs in the desired direction and net drift velocity in the direction of the gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Sourjik1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>The sensory module of the chemotaxis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) consists of large clusters of receptor proteins that bind signal molecules to modulate rapidly (&lt;0.1 s) the activity of an associated histidine kinase, CheA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Bray1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Li1">[7]</xref>. The high gain of the receptor cluster is coupled to negative integral feedback control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Alon1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yi1">[10]</xref>, mediated by slow (∼1–30 seconds) methylation and demethylation of the receptors by CheR and CheB, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Korobkova1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Min2">[13]</xref>. This allows the receptors to adapt to a constant background signal while maintaining sensitivity over a wide range of concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Lazova1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Tu1">[15]</xref>. For example, when cells are stimulated with a step of aspartate, the activity of the receptors returns nearly precisely to its pre-stimulus level after a transient response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1B</xref> first line). While precise adaptation does not hold when receptors become saturated, adaptation with a precision above 80% has been measured for many relevant signals within the micromolar range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Neumann1">[16]</xref>. Precise adaptation is an important feature of bacterial chemotaxis because it provides robustness by implementing a “maximin” strategy that guarantees at least minimum chemotactic performance in any environmental condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Celani1">[17]</xref>.</p>

<title>Dynamical coupling between the sensor and the actuator in the bacterial chemotaxis system.</title>
<p><bold>A.</bold> The bacterial chemotaxis system is composed of a sensor module (receptor-kinase complexes) and an actuator module (flagellar motors) coupled through the phosphorylated form of CheY. Both modules are ultra-sensitive and adapt to their respective input signals. Maintaining the output of the sensor within the right range relative to the actuator is critical for chemotaxis performance. <bold>B.</bold> Diagrams of the CheY-P concentration response to different signals. First line: when cells are immobilized onto a slide, a step stimulus of attractant (e.g. methylaspartate) causes a sudden decrease in CheY-P concentration followed by a slower adaptation. Because of the negative integral feedback architecture of the sensor module, CheY-P adapts back to its pre-stimulus level, the adapted CheY-P concentration, <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>. Second line: when immobilized cells are exposed to an exponential ramp in time of the same stimulus, the system, which is log sensing, experiences a constant “force” and adapts towards an operational CheY-P concentration, <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic>, lower than the adapted level <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>. This deviation of CheY-P activity from <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> to <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic> changes the coupling between sensor and actuator. Third line: when cells are swimming in a gradient of attractant, their biased random walk causes them to climb the gradient. The average drift velocity of the cell up a chemical gradient affects the average input signal experienced by the cell. This creates a feedback of the behavior onto the input signal, which in turn can significantly affect the operating concentration of CheY-P and thus the coupling between sensor and actuator.</p>

<p>The activity of the sensory module is relayed through a diffusible response regulator CheY to the flagellar motors, which act as the actuator, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). When phosphorylated by CheA, CheY-P binds to the motor subunit FliM and increases the probability of the motor to switch from CCW to CW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Berg2">[18]</xref>. Fast dephosphorylation of CheY-P by the phosphatase CheZ ensures rapid transfer of information from the sensor to the actuators.</p>
<p>The CW bias of the flagellar motor, which defines the tumbling probability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Sneddon1">[2]</xref>, is a sensitive function of the CheY-P concentration (Hill coefficient &gt;10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Cluzel1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan1">[20]</xref>. The capability of the system to maintain the CheY-P concentration within the tight dynamic range of the motor CW bias response function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) is often used to investigate robustness to fluctuations in protein concentrations and receptor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Kollmann1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Lovdok1">[22]</xref>. An important underlying assumption is that performance is maximized when the motor converts small variations in CheY-P into large changes in CW bias.</p>
<p>However, recent experiments and theory suggest that the coupling between sensor and actuator is more complex than previously thought. First, the flagellar motors partially adapt to persistent stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Lele1">[24]</xref>. Second, the motor CW bias response to CheY-P is steeper than previously reported, further restricting the dynamic range of the motor response to CheY-P fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan1">[20]</xref>. Finally, in exponential ramps of chemoattractant, the CheY-P concentration reaches a dynamical equilibrium, <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic>, hereafter called <italic>operational</italic> CheY-P, distinct from the <italic>adapted</italic> CheY-P concentration, <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>, that the cell maintains in constant uniform environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Vladimirov1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Shimizu1">[26]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1B</xref> second line). For each of these three findings, the characterization of the internal dynamics of the signaling pathway was performed on immobilized cells using experimentally controlled input signals. However, for cells swimming freely in chemical gradients, the input signal dynamics are determined by the chemotactic response of the cell, creating a feedback of the behavior onto the input signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1B</xref> third line). Because of this behavioral feedback, it remains unclear how the multiple time scales of the system, from signal detection to motor response, ultimately determine chemotactic drift performance.</p>
<p>Here, we use analytical models and stochastic simulations of individual cells to examine the consequences of these new observations for our understanding of the bacterial chemotaxis strategy. Clonal populations of chemotactic <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in homogeneous conditions exhibit significant cell-to-cell phenotypic variability, with adaptation times ranging from 1 to 30 seconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Spudich1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Park1">[31]</xref>, and motor clockwise bias ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Min1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Park1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, we consider how different combinations of adaptation times and motor clockwise biases, which define a cell's phenotype, affect individual cell chemotactic drift velocity in different environments. In a phenotypically diverse population, different phenotypes of that population may perform best in different environments.</p>
<p>Focusing on how information transfer from sensor to actuator affects chemotactic performance, we analyze the dynamical relationship between the operational regime of CheY-P, <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic>, and the drift velocity, <italic>V<sub>D</sub></italic>, as a function of the phenotype and gradient steepness. We show that there is a unique operational regime of the sensor with respect to the motor that maximizes drift velocity in the direction of the gradient by maximizing the contrast between runs up and down the gradient, and not by maximizing the CW bias response. We characterize the performance trade-off faced by individual cells with different combinations of phenotypic parameters (such as, adapted CheY-P concentration, <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>, receptor adaptation time, <italic>τ</italic>, and cell resting tumble bias, <italic>TB<sub>0</sub></italic>).</p>

<title>Maximizing contrast in run durations rather than CW bias response maximizes chemotactic drift velocity</title>
<p>Previous studies have examined how <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotactic drift velocity along a one dimensional gradient depends on the adaptation time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Vladimirov1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Andrews1">[32]</xref>, the shape of the response function of the sensory module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Celani1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Clark1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-deGennes1">[34]</xref> and also behavioral feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref>. Instead, we first focus on how the coupling between the sensors and actuators by the response regulator CheY-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) affects the chemotactic performance of individual cell phenotypes. What CheY-P concentration maximizes drift velocity of cells navigating exponential gradients of methyl-aspartate? We examine this question using stochastic simulations of individual cells and an analytical model.</p>
<p>Simulations were conducted using a standard model of the chemotaxis pathway in individual cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Sneddon1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Tu1">[15]</xref> as described in Methods. Receptor-kinase complex activity is modeled as an all-or-none response using quasi-equilibrium dynamics for fast ligand binding, chemoreceptor conformational changes, and phosphorylation cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Tu1">[15]</xref>. The slower (de)methylation kinetics follow simple negative integral feedback dynamics with adaptation rate <italic>τ</italic><sup>−1</sup>. The flagellar motor is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process that switches cell behavior between runs and tumbles with rates defined as a function of CheY-P concentration that varies in time, <italic>Y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). The parameters of the motor model are calibrated to recent experimental measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Cluzel1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Lele1">[24]</xref>. While motor adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan2">[23]</xref> is not included at first, its effects are analyzed later in the paper. During runs, a cell swims with constant speed <italic>v</italic> = 20 µm<sup>−1</sup> in a direction subjected to rotational diffusion (rotation diffusion constant, <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.062 rad<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Berg1">[1]</xref>). For simplicity the effects of multiple flagellar motors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Sneddon1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Mears1">[35]</xref> or directional persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Berg1">[1]</xref> are not included but discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> section. Hence, in this model, motor clockwise bias (CW) and cell tumble bias (TB) are the same. We consider cells containing only Tar receptors and use methyl-aspartate as the ligand. Our results readily extend to more complex receptor cluster configurations.</p>
<p>Three-dimensional trajectories of individual cells were simulated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Sneddon1">[2]</xref> for various cell phenotypes, which are characterized by the receptor adaptation times <italic>τ</italic> and adapted CheY-P concentrations <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>, in gradients of chemoattractant of different steepness, <italic>g</italic>. Following previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Vladimirov1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref>, we used exponential gradients (<italic>L(x) = L<sub>0</sub>e<sup>gx</sup></italic>) so that cells experience an approximately constant “force” from the attractant field, as the chemotaxis system is a fold-change detector (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e007">Eq. (2)</xref> below). This makes it possible to define a steady-state drift velocity, making the problem analytically tractable. The performance of each cell phenotype, which is defined by a unique adapted CheY-P concentration (<italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>) and receptor adaptation time (<italic>τ</italic>), in each gradient steepness (<italic>g</italic>) is defined as the drift velocity <italic>V<sub>D</sub></italic>(<italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>, <italic>τ</italic>, <italic>g</italic>) along the gradient direction calculated by averaging the velocity of 10,000 phenotypically identical cells over 4 minutes (Methods). The first simulations were done in a relatively shallow gradient <italic>g</italic><sup>−1</sup> = 5,000 µm, with adaptation times of <italic>τ</italic> = 5, 10, and 30 s, and adapted CheY-P concentrations spanning the range <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> = 1–4 µM.</p>
<p>Plotting drift velocity as a function of the adapted CheY-P concentration reveals that maximal drift velocity is not achieved for CheY-P concentrations in the linear range of the CW bias response curve, where fluctuations in CheY-P result in large changes in clockwise bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Instead, it occurs when adapted CheY-P is at the lower end of this curve (around 2.4 µM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Analytical model of the drift velocity as a function of CheY-P concentration</title>
<p>To understand the underlying reasons of this result, we derived an analytical relationship between CheY-P concentration and drift velocity along a one-dimensional gradient.

<p>At quasi-steady state (for time scales longer than single run durations) and with no directional persistence (equal probability to run up or down the gradient), the drift velocity is proportional to the cell swimming speed <italic>v</italic> times the difference between the expected run durations up <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and down <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the gradient divided by the total time including the time spent tumbling <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Schnitzer1">[36]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003694.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>The only difference between <italic>d</italic> = 2 or <italic>d</italic> = 3 dimensions is a rescaling of the drift velocity and rotational diffusion (factor <italic>d</italic> in the equations above; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003694.s007">Text S1</xref>).</p>

This in turn causes the CheY-P concentration to decrease (increase) when cells swim up (down) the gradient.

<p>The expected durations of a run, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or a tumble, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, are plotted as a function of CheY-P concentration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref> (dashed lines; see definition in Methods). When a cell runs up or down the gradient, the rates of switching from one state to another change as a function of time and the direction of motion because they depend on the CheY-P trajectory. A run up or down the gradient can also be terminated by random reorientation from rotational diffusion with rate (<italic>d</italic>-1)<italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Schnitzer1">[36]</xref>.

<p>In a shallow gradient, <italic>F</italic> deviates little from the adapted value <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> and the adapted value of <italic>τ<sub>R</sub></italic> provides a good approximation of the expected run duration along a direction (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref>): <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When swimming up or down the gradient, CheY-P fluctuates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, green lines for up, red lines for down) and the run lengths are modulated approximately following <italic>τ<sub>R0</sub></italic> (black line and red and green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e006">equation (1)</xref>, drift velocity is largest where the contrast between run duration up and down the gradient is the largest. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref> reveals that this is the case where the slope of the expected run length as a function of CheY-P concentration is largest, which corresponds to the foot of the motor CW bias curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) in agreement with the simulations. In contrast, for higher valued of CheY-P that are within the dynamic range of the CW bias response function, (e.g. <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> = 3 µM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) run durations up and down the gradient have a smaller contrast and longer tumble duration (dashed line <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), resulting in slower drift velocity.</p>
<p>In the limit of shallow gradients, Equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Berg1">[1]</xref> can be linearized around the adapted values <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> to obtain the drift velocity (Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003694.s007">Text S1</xref>):<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003694.e015"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e015" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the tumble bias of the cell as a function of the adapted CheY-P concentration <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> and the subscript <sub>0</sub> indicates that the rates <italic>λ<sub>R</sub></italic> and <italic>λ<sub>T</sub></italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are all evaluated at the adapted state.

<p>Plotting the drift velocity as a function of <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> on top of the simulation results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e015">Equation (3)</xref> provides a good prediction of the drift velocity in shallow gradients and confirms that maximum velocity is reached for CheY-P values at the foot of the CW bias response curve.</p>
<p>In this linear regime, the optimal CheY-P concentration is only weakly dependent on the cell adaptation time and does not depend on the gradient steepness. The factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e015">Equation (3)</xref> encapsulates the relationship between drift velocity and the CheY-P concentration (or free energy difference <italic>F</italic>). For small adaptation times, <italic>τ</italic>&lt;&lt;<italic>τ<sub>R0</sub></italic>, it increases linearly with adaptation time and is maximum where the slope <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is largest. For larger adaptation times, <italic>τ</italic>&gt;&gt;<italic>τ<sub>R0</sub></italic>, this factor becomes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Because the response function of the motor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (defined in Methods) is very steep (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), the slope <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (slope of black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) changes much faster as a function of <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> than <italic>Y<sub>0</sub>(Y<sub>0</sub>/α-1)</italic>.</p>
<p>Because rotational diffusion imposes an upper bound on the run length along a given direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Andrews1">[32]</xref>, it determines, along with the motor parameters, the optimal range for CheY-P fluctuations. As rotational diffusion becomes smaller, cells are able to maintain their original direction for a longer time. The upper bound on the run length therefore becomes longer (dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and the optimal CheY-P concentration becomes smaller (full lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in the switching frequency of the flagellar motor, ω, (see Methods) also affects the optimal CheY-P concentration. This becomes apparent when considering that the rate of switching from run to tumbles scales linearly with the switching rate of the flagellar motor, ω (see Methods). Therefore, the expected run duration of a cell scales like the inverse of ω. The result of this scaling is that for increasing values of ω the inflection point of the expected run length as a function of CheY-P shifts to lower values of CheY-P (dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, increasing the switching rate of the flagellar motors tends to decrease the optimal CheY-P concentration (full lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). It also increases the maximum drift velocity that can be reached.</p>
<p>The analytical model of drift velocity in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e015">Eq. (3)</xref> is different from previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref> in two ways. First, it takes into account both the adaptation time and the tumbling state of the cell. Taking the limit <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003694.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in our model we recover the previous results. Second, in the previous study, the switching rate of the motor <italic>λ<sub>R</sub></italic> was a steep function of kinase activity centered at the adapted kinase activity level, or equivalently, at the adapted CheY-P concentration <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>. This means that changing <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> would also change the set point of the motor. However, the adapted CheY-P concentration and the set point of the motor are independent parameters. For this reason here we focused on the relationship between the set point of the motor and CheY-P activity. According to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e015">Eq. (3)</xref> the flagellar motor has its own sensitivity set point independent of the adapted CheY-P concentration of the sensory system <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> (see definition of <italic>λ<sub>R</sub></italic> in Methods; motor adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Tu2">[38]</xref> is considered below).</p>

<title>A unique operational CheY-P concentration maximizes drift velocity for multiple gradients and adaptation times</title>
<p>Experiments have shown that when immobilized cells are exposed to an exponential ramp of methyl-aspartate, CheY-P activity reaches a new steady-state, <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic>, which is lower than its adapted activity, <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>, because of the relatively slow adaptation rate of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Block1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Shimizu1">[26]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1B</xref> second line). When cells are swimming in an exponential gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1B</xref> third line), we expected a similar effect to take place because the average drift of an individual cell up the gradient will cause this cell to experience, on average, an exponential increase in ligand concentration as it makes its way up the gradient. While this effect should be minimal in a shallow gradient, it could become important in steep or rapidly changing gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Zhu1">[39]</xref>, especially for cells with longer adaptation times.</p>
<p>To investigate this issue we simulated cells swimming in a steeper exponential gradient (<italic>g</italic><sup>−1</sup> = 1,000 µm). After less than one minute of simulation, cell populations (10,000 replicate trajectories for each phenotype) reached a constant steady state drift velocity. We calculated the average ligand concentration that the cells encountered over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This reveals that the swimming cells experience an average exponential increase in ligand concentration over time. This average input is similar to the signal experienced by immobilized cells exposed to temporal exponential ramps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, second line) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Block1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Shimizu1">[26]</xref>. However, for the swimming cells the ramp rate is dynamically determined by the average drift velocity in the direction of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, for swimming cells the ramp rate depends on the feedback of the performance onto the input signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, third line). Consistent with experimental results obtained with immobilized cells exposed to exponential ramps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Shimizu1">[26]</xref>, the average CheY-P concentration in the swimming cells reaches a stable dynamical equilibrium, the operational value <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic>, after an initial drop from the adapted CheY-P concentration (<italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>The fact that the operational CheY-P concentration is not the same as the adapted CheY-P concentration implies that an optimal choice of adapted CheY-P must take into account this behavioral feedback. While a phenotype may for example have an adapted CheY-P concentration equal to the optimal concentration (∼2.4 µM), during chemotaxis this level drops to an operational level lower than the optimum, hindering its performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, solid black line). This effect is intensified when the adaptation time of the receptor cluster increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, grey line). On the other hand, a phenotype with an adapted CheY-P concentration higher than the optimal concentration can approach the optimal operational CheY-P concentration as it reaches its steady-state drift velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, dotted line). The difference between <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic> grows larger as drift velocity or the receptor adaptation time increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether the adapted or the operational CheY-P concentration is the primary variable that controls the average drift velocity in exponential gradients, we simulated cell populations with different adapted CheY-P concentrations and calculated their respective operational CheY-P concentrations. In a steep gradient (<italic>g</italic><sup>−1</sup> = 1000 µm), the optimal adapted CheY-P increased to ∼2.7 µM compared to ∼2.4 µM in a shallow gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). However, the optimal operational CheY-P concentrations for steep and shallow gradients are identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that a unique operational CheY-P concentration maximizes drift velocity in multiple gradients.</p>
<p>The situation is different when the feedback is strong. In this case the signaling pathway fluctuates around the operational values <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic>, rather than the adapted values <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>. Therefore, we need to update the analytical model to describe the drift velocity, <italic>V<sub>D</sub></italic>, as a function of <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic>. If we linearize the drift velocity equation around <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> rather than <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> we obtain an equation identical to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e015">Eq.

<title>Strong behavioral feedback can push the system through a bifurcation creating two possible chemotactic states for some cell phenotype: A fast drift state and a trapped state</title>
<p>For a given phenotype (<italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>, <italic>τ</italic>) and gradient length-scale, the steady state drift velocity is determined by the intersection of two curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The first curve (solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) describes how the drift velocity depends on the operational CheY-P concentration, <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic>. It is defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e015">Equation (3)</xref> (with <italic><sub>0→m</sub></italic>) and its profile can be interpreted as follows. For very low values of CheY-P the cell never tumbles. Thus, the cell diffuses equally in all directions and the net drift along the gradient is zero. For high values of CheY-P, the cell tumbles all the time so drift is zero as well. In between these two extremes, drift velocity is maximized for a specific value of the operational CheY-P concentration. However, <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic> is not an independent variable. As we showed above (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e029">Eq.

<p>When the feedback is weak (<italic>τNg</italic> small, i.e. short adaptation time, small gain, or shallow gradient), the operational CheY-P concentration only exhibits a weak dependency on drift velocity and there is only one steady-state solution (intersection). Therefore, an appropriate adapted CheY-P concentration could be selected to ensure that operational CheY-P concentration is approximately optimal at all times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>When the feedback is stronger, drift velocity always acts as a negative feedback onto the operational CheY-P concentration. In contrast, the effect of the operational CheY-P concentration onto drift velocity depends on whether the operational CheY-P concentration is below or above the CheY-P concentration that maximizes drift velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Below this concentration, the system obeys negative feedback dynamics, whereas above it, the system obeys positive feedback dynamics. This positive feedback loops combined with the non-linear decrease of the drift velocity as a function of the operational CheY-P concentration, which arise from the extreme sensitivity of the flagellar motor, can lead to bistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Angeli1">[40]</xref>. Indeed, for a stronger feedback (steeper gradient or longer adaptation time) the slope of the feedback curve (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4AB</xref>), which is proportional to 1/<italic>τNg</italic>, decreases. Thus, for phenotypes with high enough adapted CheY-P concentration (<italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> is the intersection of the dashed line with the horizontal axis), the two curves can intersect more than once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In this case, a single phenotype can now experience three different chemotactic states. Two of these states, <italic>Y<sub>m1</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>m2</sub></italic> (filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), are stable and are separated by one unstable state (open circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). For one of the stable solution, the drift velocity is nearly zero and <italic>Y<sub>m1</sub></italic> is high and very close to the adapted CheY-P concentration. For the other stable solution, the drift velocity is large and <italic>Y<sub>m2</sub></italic> is much smaller than the adapted CheY-P concentration.</p>
<p>This analysis suggests that an individual phenotype might experience two different chemotactic states with dramatically different performance: a fast drifting state and a “trapped” state. To find evidence of these two behaviors, we simulated two cell phenotypes (10,000 replicates for each phenotype) in a steep exponential gradient (<italic>g</italic><sup>−1</sup> = 1,000 µm). One phenotype was predicted to operate closer to the bifurcation than the other (red and blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, respectively). Although both phenotypes reached the same average operational CheY-P (<italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic> = 2.3 µM), cells with a phenotype closer to the predicted bifurcation point (<italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> = 3 µM, <italic>τ</italic> = 30 s) exhibited a distribution of behavior (both drift velocity and diffusion) significantly skewed toward the “trapped” state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Closer examination of the trajectories and CheY-P dynamics of individual cells in this simulation reveals that individual cells transition stochastically back and forth between the “trapped” and fast drifting state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003694.s002">Figure S2</xref>). For cases with higher feedback strength cells spend more and more time within the “trapped” state.</p>
<p>When the feedback is strong and the system becomes multistable, the average includes cells in both the “trapped” and high drift states. This phenomenon explains the decreased average drift velocities observed when adaptation time is increased (above 10 seconds) in a relatively steep gradient (<italic>g</italic><sup>−1</sup> = 1,000 µm). It also explains the resulting shift of the best operational CheY-P concentration to lower concentrations (from ∼2.4 to 2.1 µM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), since for phenotypes with lower values of the adapted CheY-P only one stable state exists. Similar results are obtained when asymmetric methylation/demethylation rates of the receptors are taken into account (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003694.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Motor adaptation partially alleviates the chemotactic “trap”</title>

<p>Simulations of cells with motor adaptation in a shallow gradient (<italic>g</italic><sup>−1</sup> = 5,000 µm) show that motor adaptation changes the shape of the drift velocity curve as a function of operational CheY-P, especially at high CheY-P concentrations (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">2A</xref>). These results are predicted by the analytical model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e015">Eq. (3)</xref> with <italic><sub>0→m</sub></italic>) once modified to include motor adaptation (Methods; lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Setting the adapted activity of the motor for a given CheY-P concentration to lower or higher CW biases gives qualitatively equivalent results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003694.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003694.s005">S5</xref>).</p>
<p>How does the motor adaptation affect the bifurcation? In a steep gradient the behavioral feedback (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e029">Eq. (4)</xref>) must be taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figure 5C</xref> dashed line). Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g004">4B</xref> we see that motor adaptation enable cells with high adapted CheY-P concentration to avoid the chemotactic trap improving performance (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003694.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This should provide a selective advantage because it helps buffer the functional consequences of inevitable cell-to-cell variability in the adapted CheY-P concentration, by increasing the range of CheY expression levels that allows effective chemotaxis.</p>
<p>Motor adaptation also affects the optimal operational CheY-P concentration (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">2A</xref>), shifting it to lower concentrations. When cells are drifting up a gradient, CheY-P drops to the operational CheY-P, causing the CW bias to drop. With motor adaptation, the lower operating CW bias causes the motor to shift its sensitivity to a lower CheY-P concentration. We see again that maximal performance is reached for <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic> at the bottom of the CW bias response curve of the now adapted motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the motor can only compensate partially for the shift in operational CheY-P concentration.</p>

<p>In shallow gradients, the strength of the feedback is small, as is the difference between operational and adapted CheY-P. Thus, it is possible to select an adapted CheY-P concentration that will perform relatively well for multiple adaptation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g006">Figure 6A</xref> blue line).In steeper gradients, the feedback is stronger (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003694.e029">Eq. (4)</xref>) and the difference between <italic>Y<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> grows larger with adaptation time. Maintaining the optimal operational CheY-P concentration requires a higher adapted CheY-P concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figure 5A</xref> green and red). The bifurcation of the system imposes an upper bound on the range of <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> beyond which a portion of the cells spend a significant amount of time trapped into a non-optimal state even with motor adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g006">Figure 6A</xref> dashed lines). Therefore, the optimal adapted CheY-P concentration is a function of both receptor adaptation time and gradient length-scale, making it difficult for a single phenotype to maximize drift velocity in multiple environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize the resulting performance trade-off and map it to phenotypic space, we calculated the contours of drift velocity relative to its maximum in each environment, as a function of adaptation time <italic>τ</italic> and the adapted cell tumble bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In shallow gradients, cells benefit from a relatively long adaptation time and a low adapted CW bias. In steep gradients, cells benefit from a short adaptation time and a higher adapted CW bias. The best generalist phenotype can achieve at most 60% relative performance in all three gradients considered here.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The adaptive response and feedback control of the receptor cluster play a critical role in the robustness of the chemotaxis system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Alon1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Tu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Celani1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Clark1">[33]</xref>. However, chemotactic performance also relies on the optimal operation of the flagellar motors, which directly control cell behavior. By focusing on how the CheY-P concentration affects the coupling between sensors and actuators, we revealed the existence of an <italic>operational</italic> regime for CheY-P concentration, which is distinct from the adapted CheY-P concentration, that maximizes drift velocity in a wide range of gradient length-scales and receptor adaptation times. Fluctuations around the best operational CheY-P concentrations maximize the contrast between run duration up and down the gradients. This occurs outside the most sensitive region of the CW bias response curve of the motor. Thus, chemotactic performance relies on maintaining the operational CheY-P concentration within bounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Kollmann1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Lovdok1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Oleksiuk1">[41]</xref> around this optimal value.</p>
<p>The best operational CheY-P concentration is also determined by the cell rotational diffusion constant <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic>, which imposes an upper bound on run durations in any particular direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Andrews1">[32]</xref>. In a more viscous environment or for longer cells, the lower rotational diffusion will result in a lower optimal operational CheY-P concentration. For an ellipsoid, rotational diffusion is inversely proportional the length of the major axis. Therefore, as cells grow the optimal range will shift to lower CheY-P concentrations. If the cell maintains a constant amount of CheY as it grew, the effective concentration of CheY-P would decrease, resulting in robust chemotactic performance during cell growth.</p>
<p>The switching frequency of the flagellar motors also affects the best operational CheY-P concentration. Higher switching frequencies tend to increase drift velocity while shifting the maximum to smaller CheY-P concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, the best operational CheY-P concentration is further away from the motor threshold. However, the range of CheY-P concentrations where the drift velocity is high becomes narrower (because the expected run length becomes a steeper function of CheY-P). This tends to increase the performance trade-off between different gradient length-scales. Thus, while selecting a higher switching frequency for the flagellar motors may improve performance of some phenotypes it may be detrimental for the population overall. Another important consideration is that the switching frequency is bounded by the speed at which the motor and associated flagella can switch confirmation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Sneddon1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Turner1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Directional persistence (amount by which the swimming direction of a new run is biased towards the swimming direction of previous run) has been shown to affect chemotactic performance in climbing shallow gradients of attractants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Berg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Saragosti1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Locsei1">[45]</xref>. However, previous modeling and simulations efforts have been done using cells with non-optimal CheY-P concentrations (usually at 3 µM). In this regime, cells have a high tumbling rate, short run lengths, and low drift velocity. Directional persistence effectively reduces the reorientation rate of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Locsei1">[45]</xref>, which is equivalent to reducing the tumbling rate slightly. Therefore, directional persistence will shift the optimal CheY-P concentration to higher concentrations and improve the drift velocity of frequently tumbling cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Nicolau1">[44]</xref>. On the other hand, when cells operate at or close to the optimal CheY-P concentration, the tumbling rate is low. Therefore, the run length in a given direction is terminated by rotational diffusion and not by tumbles. For optimal phenotypes, the relative effect of directional persistence on chemotactic drift is thus less important.</p>
<p>Previous studies have examined how the adaptation time affects chemotactic performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Pontius1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Vladimirov1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Si1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Andrews1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Emonet1">[46]</xref>. However, these studies only considered single values for the adapted CheY-P concentration (typically set to a CW bias of 0.5) and concluded that adaptation time should decrease as gradients get steeper to keep the operational CheY-P concentration within the dynamic range of the motor CW bias response. We found that, as long as the cell can maintain the optimal operational CheY-P concentration, longer adaptation time is better because it enhances input signal over the course of a run. However, long adaptation reinforces the feedback from the cell drift velocity on the system and can lead to undesirable bistability. Therefore, the bifurcation boundary imposes an upper limit on adaptation time as a function of the gradient length-scale. Interestingly, the distribution of tumble bias typically observed during exponential growth in single <italic>E. coli</italic> cells ranges from 0.1 to about 0.4 and not many cells are found that have higher tumble bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Park1">[31]</xref>. Selection for cells with tumble bias below 0.4 is consistent with our finding that the performance of cells with higher tumble bias will suffer from the existence of the “trapped” chemotaxis state.</p>
<p>Our results also provide a strong justification for the role of the recently-discovered flagellar motor adaptation. Indeed, we found that motor adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Tu2">[38]</xref> plays a significant role in mitigating the behavioral feedback for cells with high tumble bias. When such feedback was included, cells with high tumble bias could escape the “trap” and gain access to a high drifting state in steep gradient. Our model also resolved an apparent contradiction between two sets of experimental measurements of the CW bias response of the flagellar motor as a function of CheY-P concentration. While one measurements reported a Hill coefficient of <italic>n = 10</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Cluzel1">[19]</xref>, newer experiments reported a Hill coefficient of <italic>n = 20</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Yuan1">[20]</xref>. In this paper we used the new value <italic>n = 20</italic> and showed that the previous measurements are fitted with the same parameter value if one makes the reasonable assumption that the motors had had time to adapt before each individual cell measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the difference between the operational and adapted CheY-P concentrations depends on the strength of the behavioral feedback, which itself is proportional to gradient steepness, different adapted CheY-P concentrations and adaptation times are required to perform optimally in different gradients. Thus, in conditions where drift velocity is important, cells are faced with a performance trade-off. Even though motor adaptation was included, the best compromising phenotype over the gradient steepness considered in this study achieved at most 60% of the theoretical maximal drift velocity in all gradients. The observed cell-to-cell phenotypic diversity in adaptation time and adapted tumble bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Masson1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Park1">[31]</xref> in an isogenic population may resolve the performance trade-off faced by single cells to improve the chance of survival of a unique genotype in complex or varying environments. In addition, the negative correlation between tumble bias and adaptation time observed by Park <italic>et al.</italic> in an isogenic population of <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003694-Park1">[31]</xref>, is consistent with our predictions about the most beneficial way to distribute phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003694-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>At its core, the biased random walk relies on the dynamical control of the probability of reorientation. Overall, our analysis reveals limits to the use of negative integral feedback to control such strategy. Because the biased random walk strategy is used by many organisms, these results will inform our understanding of the constraints faced by other organisms as well.</p>
