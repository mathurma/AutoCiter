        <p>Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a nuclear transcription factor that responds to environmental and pathological hypoxia to induce metabolic adaptation, vascular growth, and cell survival. Here we found that HIF subunits and HIF2α in particular were normally expressed in the mediobasal hypothalamus of mice. Hypothalamic HIF was up-regulated by glucose to mediate the feeding control of hypothalamic glucose sensing. Two underlying molecular pathways were identified, including suppression of PHDs by glucose metabolites to prevent HIF2α degradation and the recruitment of AMPK and mTOR/S6K to regulate HIF2α protein synthesis. HIF activation was found to directly control the transcription of <italic>POMC</italic> gene. Genetic approach was then employed to develop conditional knockout mice with HIF inhibition in POMC neurons, revealing that HIF loss-of-function in POMC neurons impaired hypothalamic glucose sensing and caused energy imbalance to promote obesity development. The metabolic effects of HIF in hypothalamic POMC neurons were independent of leptin signaling or pituitary ACTH pathway. Hypothalamic gene delivery of HIF counteracted overeating and obesity under conditions of nutritional excess. In conclusion, HIF controls hypothalamic <italic>POMC</italic> gene to direct the central nutrient sensing in regulation of energy and body weight balance.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The hypothalamus in the brain is a master regulator of feeding and body weight. The regulation of it is mediated by the ability of the hypothalamus to sense nutrients (most importantly glucose) and hormones (such as insulin and leptin). While hormone has been extensively studied, we know less about how the hypothalamus can sense nutrients. It is also unclear whether changes in hypothalamic nutrient sensing can influence the development of obesity and related disease, and could therefore be targeted for disease intervention. In this study, we show that a protein termed hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is normally present in the hypothalamus and able to respond to glucose. This glucose response leads to the up-regulation of a hypothalamic neuropeptide, POMC, a pivotal molecule that controls feeding and body weight balance. We then developed a mouse model in which HIF is disrupted in hypothalamic cells that express POMC. These mice displayed reduced hypothalamic sensitivity to glucose, resulting in overeating and susceptibility to obesity. Furthermore, we found that delivery of the HIF gene into the hypothalamus has strong anti-obesity effects in mice. We conclude that HIF is a molecular mediator of hypothalamic glucose sensing and can be potentially targeted for obesity therapeutics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the central nuclear transcription factor that is induced under environmental (e.g., high altitude) and pathological (e.g., cancer) hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Gordan1">[2]</xref>. HIF exists as the heterodimer of an α subunit and a β subunit; HIFα protein levels are regulated based on tissue oxygen availability, while HIFβ (also called aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, or ARNT) is constitutively present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>. Under normoxia, HIFα undergoes protein hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, and this process is mediated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and ubiqutin E3 ligase pVHL—the product of von Hippel-Lindau (<italic>VHL</italic>) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>. Under hypoxia, PHDs are suppressed, leading to HIFα protein stabilization and thus the transcriptional action of HIFα/β in inducing genes that classically regulate metabolic adaptation, vascular growth, and cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>. Among three HIFα isoforms (HIF1α, HIF2α, and HIF3α), HIF1α and HIF2α have been extensively studied in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>. While both HIF1α and HIF2α mediate hypoxia adaptation, HIF2α can control a distinct set of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Hu1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Hu2">[6]</xref>. Consistently, the biological consequences of HIF2α versus HIF1α ablation in mice are different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Compernolle1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Tian1">[9]</xref>, suggesting that HIF2α and HIF1α have divergent physiological functions.</p>
      <p>Recent research has elucidated that regulation of HIF1/2α by hypoxia involves metabolic mediators, such as reactive oxygen species that can modulate mitochondrial complex III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Guzy1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Lum1">[12]</xref>. In addition, HIF is subjected to normoxic regulation, and the underlying basis has been related to several metabolic signaling pathways including the PI3K-mTOR cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Emerling1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Hudson1">[15]</xref> and SIRT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Dioum1">[16]</xref>. The biochemical regulation of HIF by various metabolic signals has been implicated to underlie the metabolic programming of tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>. However, it remains unexplored whether a reverse relationship might exist, i.e., if HIF could be a primary regulator of metabolic physiology at an organism level and hence a critical target for controlling metabolic disease, and if so, what could be the responsible tissue/cell types and the underlying molecular basis.</p>
      <p>The hypothalamus in the central nervous system (CNS) is the master regulator of energy intake (feeding), energy expenditure, and body weight balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Schwartz1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Barsh1">[21]</xref>. The responsible neuronal regulation involves not only hormonal sensing by molecules such as leptin and insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Schwartz1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Barsh1">[21]</xref> but also nutrient sensing by species such as glucose, amino acid, and fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Lam1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kahn1">[32]</xref>. Compared to the long-term homeostatic regulation of body weight by hypothalamic hormonal signaling, hypothalamic glucose sensing is rapid and predicted to provide an acute and real-time regulation on metabolic homeostasis. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons, termed POMC neurons, have been identified to account for hypothalamic glucose sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Parton1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Ibrahim1">[33]</xref>. In this report, we demonstrate that hypothalamic glucose sensing is mediated by HIF activation and resulting up-regulation of <italic>POMC</italic> gene and that HIF loss-of-function in POMC neurons causes glucose desensitization to promote energy imbalance and obesity development.</p>

        <title>HIF Controls POMC Gene Transcription</title>
        <p>In order to screen nuclear transcription factors that control hypothalamic neuropeptide genes, we analyzed the DNA sequence of <italic>POMC</italic> promoter and identified a HIF-responsive element at the proximal promoter region across species from rodents to humans. POMC is the precursor of hypothalamic neuropeptide, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which is an important hypothalamic regulator of feeding and energy balance, and mutation of <italic>POMC</italic> gene is sufficient to cause severe obesity and diabetes in both rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Yaswen1">[34]</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Krude1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Farooqi1">[36]</xref>. Notably, the HIF-binding DNA element (5′-GCGTG-3′) is located immediately upstream of the transcriptional initiation site (TATA box) in the <italic>POMC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, the DNA elements for STAT3, the most established nuclear transcription factor for <italic>POMC</italic> gene in leptin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Banks1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Munzberg1">[39]</xref>, are located further upstream. Using a luciferase reporter system, we found that overexpression of HIF1α and HIF2α increased the activities of transfected <italic>POMC</italic> promoter by 12 folds and 26 folds, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). When HIF1α or HIF2α was co-overexpressed with HIFβ, the heterodimeric complex activated <italic>POMC</italic> promoter by 362–466-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, deletion of the 5-bp HIF-binding DNA element (5′-GCGTG-3′) substantially prevented HIF from activating the mutant <italic>POMC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). All these data suggest that POMC gene represents a HIF target.</p>

        <title>Differential Patterns of HIF1α and HIF2α in the Hypothalamus</title>
        <p>To explore whether there was an anatomic basis to support a metabolic role of hypothalamic HIF, we then profiled HIF isoform distribution in the hypothalamus as well as other brain regions. Western blot analysis of HIF2α showed high protein levels in the hypothalamus but low levels in many other brain regions, including cortex, thalamus, olfactory bulb, pons, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Unlike HIF2α, HIF1α protein expression was normally weak throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We then performed brain immunostaining of HIF2α versus HIF1α. The specificity of HIF2α and HIF1α antibodies for immunostaining were both verified through exogenous expression and co-immunostaining with conjugated epitope tags. In these experiments, hypothalamic GT1-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmid, which expressed myc-tagged HIF2α or myc-tagged HIF1α. The induction of HIFα isoforms was detected by the immunostaining of anti-HIF1α or anti-HIF2α antibody, and the specificity was confirmed by co-immunostaining with anti-myc antibody. The results showed that anti-HIF2α antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and anti-HIF1α antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s002">Figure S2</xref>) provided equal sensitivity and did not yield cross-reactions. Subsequently, we employed these two antibodies to map HIF2α versus HIF1α in the brain of normal C57BL/6 mice. Immunostaining revealed that HIF2α was abundant in neurons of the mediobasal hypothalamus that comprised the arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), but less abundant in many other brain regions (unpublished data). Compared to HIF2α, HIF1α was weakly expressed in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and barely detectable in many other brain regions. Altogether, these data suggest that HIFα, in particular HIF2α, might be involved in hypothalamic regulation of whole-body physiology.</p>

        <title>HIF Inhibition in POMC Neurons Abrogates Feeding Regulation of Glucose Sensing</title>
        <p>POMC neurons have been known as a major hypothalamic neuronal type that mediates glucose sensing of the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Parton1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Ibrahim1">[33]</xref>. Hence, we investigated whether HIF inactivation in POMC neurons could affect hypothalamic glucose sensing in regulation of feeding. To test this question, we chose to ablate <italic>HIFβ</italic> gene, since HIFβ is mandatory for the DNA binding and activation of both HIF1 and HIF2 complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>.

Using this tool, we revealed that HIFβ protein was disrupted in the majority (∼90%) of POMC neurons in <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g002">Figure 2A&amp;B</xref>).

        <p><italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice were developmentally indistinguishable from littermate control <italic>HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice. <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and controls at young ages (1∼3 mo old) had similar body weight. This knockout mouse model was then employed to test whether <italic>HIFβ</italic> ablation could compromise nutrient-induced hypothalamic <italic>POMC</italic> mRNA expression. Two experimental paradigms were used: supply of general nutrients through re-feeding post-fasting and glucose administration through third-ventricle infusion. First, it was found that re-feeding post-fasting significantly increased hypothalamic levels of <italic>POMC</italic> mRNA in control mice, but failed to do so in <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>HIFβ</italic> ablation did not alter mRNA levels of hypothalamic neuropeptides <italic>CART</italic>, <italic>AGRP</italic>, and <italic>NPY</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) or hindbrain neuropeptide <italic>nesfatin-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). We also examined a few other nuclear transcription factors including <italic>BSX</italic>, <italic>FoxO1</italic>, and <italic>CREB</italic>, which can also control neuropeptide expression. The expression levels of these genes were unchanged in the hypothalamus of <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Second, we performed the experiment using third-ventricle glucose infusion. Similar to re-feeding, glucose infusion up-regulated hypothalamic <italic>POMC</italic> mRNA levels in control mice; however, this up-regulation was not induced in <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In sum, the data suggested that HIF mediates glucose-dependent hypothalamic POMC gene expression.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we investigated whether the <italic>HIFβ</italic> ablation could compromise the feeding-restricting effect of hypothalamic glucose sensing. Following a prolonged fasting (24 h), <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and their littermate controls received third-ventricle injection of glucose via pre-implanted cannula. Indeed, glucose suppressed fasting-induced feeding in control mice. This anorexic effect occurred rapidly within 6 h post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) and lasted throughout 24-h follow-up period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, glucose-induced appetite suppression was substantially abolished in <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g002">Figure 2F&amp;G</xref>). Hence, HIF in POMC neurons is required for glucose-dependent hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior.</p>

        <title>Absence of Pituitary Changes in POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup> Mice</title>
        <p>POMC cells are present in the hypothalamus as well as the pituitary; thus, both places were targeted by the Cre-loxp technique for <italic>HIFβ</italic> ablation in the knockout mice. Following the above observations in <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice, we examined whether the pituitary POMC cells were affected by <italic>HIFβ</italic> ablation in the knockout mice. Because pituitary POMC is the precursor of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), we evaluated the pituitary ACTH synthesis via ACTH immunostaining. Data revealed that the numbers of pituitary ACTH-positive cells and ACTH expression levels were similar between <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and littermate controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s005">Figure S5A&amp;B</xref>).

Also, since the main function of ACTH is to control adrenal growth and corticosterone release, we analyzed the histology of adrenal glands from <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and matched controls. Indeed, the adrenal morphology and mass were comparable between <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s005">Figure S5E&amp;F</xref>).

        <title>Glucose Suppresses PHDs to Stabilize Hypothalamic HIF2α</title>
        <p>The next question was: How could glucose activate hypothalamic HIF? Since mRNA levels of hypothalamic <italic>HIF2α</italic> and <italic>HIF1α</italic> were not affected by third-ventricle glucose infusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s004">Figure S4C</xref>), glucose regulation of hypothalamic HIF was not mediated via <italic>HIF</italic> mRNA expression. In contrast, third-ventricle glucose infusion significantly increased HIF2α protein levels in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g003">Figure 3A&amp;B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). This effect was not evident in peripheral tissues of mice that were i.p. injected with glucose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s006">Figure S6B&amp;C</xref>). To understand the molecular basis for glucose-induced hypothalamic HIF up-regulation, we tested if it involved PHDs-dependent HIFα hydroxylation and degradation—which is the classical molecular cascade in regulation of HIF activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Gordan1">[2]</xref>. Using the GHO assay, which was established in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Pan1">[42]</xref>, we found that third-ventricle glucose delivery suppressed the hydroxylation activities of PHDs in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We also examined pVHL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitination and degradation of hydroxylated HIFα. Glucose did not change pVHL protein levels in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that pVHL was not a primary factor for glucose-induced HIFα up-regulation. Thus, glucose employs the PHD-pVHL system to induce hypothalamic HIF up-regulation, although the magnitude of this effect was much smaller than that of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g003">Figure 3B&amp;C</xref>). We also analyzed the binding of HIF2α to p300, since the complex functions in the nucleus to exert the transcriptional activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, increased hypothalamic HIF2α protein levels were proportionally associated with the increased binding of HIF2α to p300, suggesting that up-regulation of hypothalamic HIF2α by glucose is transcriptionally functional.</p>

        <title>HIF Mediates Hypothalamic Glucose Sensing Without Involving Leptin Signaling</title>
        <p>We further asked whether HIF2α might be involved in the action of leptin, a well-established hormone that employs nuclear transcription factor STAT3 to mediate hypothalamic regulation of feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Schwartz1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Ahima1">[19]</xref>.

Thus, hypothalamic HIF was responsive to glucose but not leptin, which aligns with the observation that hypothalamic glucose sensing did not involve the induction of leptin signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). To evaluate the physiological relevance of this finding, experiments were performed to compare leptin-dependent feeding regulation in <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice versus control mice.

        <title>Glucose Up-Regulates Hypothalamic HIF2α via Fumarate and Succinate</title>
        <p>It has been recently demonstrated that glucose metabolites fumarate and succinate can inhibit PHDs to activate HIF in cancer cells to promote tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kaelin1">[4]</xref>.

Then, after having established the appropriate dose- and time-course conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s008">Figure S8A–D</xref>), we revealed that HIF2α protein levels in the hypothalamus of normal C57LB/6 mice were significantly increased by a third-ventricle delivery of either fumarate or succinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s008">Figure S8E</xref>&amp;F).

After having confirmed this effect in our experiment, we tested whether hypothalamic HIF could prevent the feeding-promoting effects of AICAR. To do this, we delivered HIF2α/HIFβ complex into the neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus, since POMC neurons are predominantly localized in this region. Through a neuron-specific lentiviral vector in which dual synapsin promoters were used to direct co-expression of two genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s010">Figure S10A</xref>), HIF2α and HIFβ were co-delivered into the mediobasal hypothalamus of standard C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s010">Figure S10B</xref>&amp;C).

        <p>To further elucidate the significance of hypothalamic HIF inhibition in obesity development, we maintained <italic>POMC/HIFβ<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and the littermate controls under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding since weaning.

        <title>Treatment of Obesity by Targeting HIF in the Hypothalamus</title>
        <p>Finally, we performed animal studies to evaluate whether hypothalamic HIF could be targeted to generate strong therapeutic effects against obesity. Although HIF2α is the major subunit in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g001">Figure 1C&amp;D</xref>), we designed experiments to evaluate the potential use of both HIF2α and HIF1α. Using the lentiviral co-expression system shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s010">Figure S10A&amp;B</xref>, we delivered HIF2α/HIFβ versus HIF1α/HIFβ into the mediobasal hypothalamus of normal C57BL/6 mice. Matched mice with gene delivery of GFP were used as the controls. Following viral injection, all mice were maintained on an HFD and longitudinally followed up for feeding and weight gain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g008">Figure 8A&amp;B</xref>, the control mice gained body weight, rapidly leading to overt obesity over a 3-mo period. In contrast, delivery of either HIF2α/HIFβ or HIF1α/HIFβ markedly reduced obesity development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g008">Figure 8A&amp;B</xref>). The anti-obesity effect of HIF gain-of-function was clearly attributed to feeding restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g008">Figure 8C&amp;D</xref>) presumably resulting from POMC gene expression up-regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001112.s010">Figure S10D</xref>). In conclusion, although hypothalamic HIF2α/HIFβ is more physiologically relevant to metabolic regulation, both HIF2α and HIF1α hold significant therapeutic potentials and can be targeted, individually or in combination, in order to counteract obesity and related metabolic diseases.</p>

      <p>This study demonstrates that HIF is present in the hypothalamus and sensitively up-regulated by the local availability of glucose and its metabolites. Glucose up-regulation of hypothalamic HIF is mediated by PHD/pVHL-dependent HIFα degradation and AMPK/mTOR-dependent HIFα synthesis. POMC neurons in the hypothalamus are critical for the metabolic role of hypothalamic HIF through its direct transcriptional regulation on <italic>POMC</italic> gene. HIF loss-of-function in POMC neurons can cause overeating and weight gain to promote obesity development, while HIF gain-of-function can provide strong therapeutic benefits against obesity (and related diseases) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001112-g009">Figure 9</xref>).

          <p>Proposed model of hypothalamic HIF in neural control of energy balance. Glucose activates hypothalamic HIF through metabolite-induced suppression of HIF protein degradation and AMPK/mTOR-related promotion of HIF protein synthesis. Activation of HIF up-regulates POMC gene, linking hypothalamic glucose sensing to the hypothalamic control of feeding, energy expenditure, body weight, and metabolic homeostasis. In conclusion, HIF in the hypothalamus represents a molecular target of protecting hypothalamic nutrient sensing in order to improve whole-body metabolic regulation of the hypothalamus and prevent against obesity and related diseases.</p>

      <p>Energy homeostasis is fundamental for living, and this physiological process relies on the complex property of the life' regulatory system in coordinately sensing and transducing the metabolic dynamics in the body. The hypothalamus is known as the “headquarters” for the regulation of energy balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Schwartz1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Cone1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Elmquist1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Woods1">[54]</xref>. This work discovered that the HIF complex plays a critical role in linking hypothalamic glucose sensing to glucose-dependent hypothalamic control of feeding and energy balance. Known as a nuclear transcription factor that mediates hypoxia adaptation, the physiological and disease significance of HIF has traditionally been explored for the pathological roles in diseases, particularly cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Poellinger1">[3]</xref>.

Here, we have demonstrated an important but unappreciated role of HIF in the hypothalamus at an organism level from the perspective of feeding and body weight regulation as well as metabolic disease, especially obesity and related health problems. Indicated by our findings, further lines of research can be expected to explore possible roles of neuronal HIF in other physiological functions and disease relevance of the hypothalamus.</p>
      <p>For almost a decade, the hypothalamus has been established as a lipostatic feeding regulator through hormonal action of leptin, which involves activation of POMC by STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Banks1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Munzberg1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Morton1">[57]</xref>. Recently, the role of the hypothalamus in nutrient sensing has become a major interest in the research field, leading to the elucidation of hypothalamic glucose sensing involving AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Lopez2">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Kahn1">[32]</xref> and KATP channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Parton1">[27]</xref> and hypothalamic amino acid-sensing process involving mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Cota1">[24]</xref>. In this study, we discovered that HIF in the hypothalamus acts as a nutrient sensor. In alignment with the fast turnover rate of HIF proteins (half life: 5∼10 min) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Semenza1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Gordan1">[2]</xref>, the HIF pathway in hypothalamic POMC neurons likely directs the real-time homeostasis of feeding and energy homeostasis. This regulation complements STAT3-dependent <italic>POMC</italic> gene expression in leptin signaling and its long-term regulation on feeding and body weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Munzberg1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Morton1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Schwartz2">[58]</xref>. Additional research seems needed to address if HIF pathway can work in other neuronal types in addition to POMC neurons in mediating hypothalamic control of metabolic physiology. Overall, this work has specifically focused on the glucose-sensing process of the hypothalamus, and along this line, it deserves further endeavors to study whether HIF pathway can function in the central sensing process of other nutrient species (such as amino acids and fatty acids) and their metabolites.</p>
      <p>The hypothalamus has been well appreciated as the master regulator of body weight and metabolic balance and a pathogenic culprit for obesity and related disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Schwartz1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Barsh1">[21]</xref>. Recent research attentions have been extensively directed to hypothalamic hormonal dysregulations and most notably the development of leptin resistance and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Zhang1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Bence1">[63]</xref>. However, it remains poorly understood how hypothalamic nutrient sensing is mediated. More importantly, it is still unclear if a molecular pathway in central nutrient sensing could be targeted to effectively counteract obesity and related disease. In this work, we found that enhancing hypothalamic glucose sensing through HIF induction per se is effective in treating obesity. Our findings are supported by a recent work showing an anti-obesity effect of HIF activation through the ablation of an HIF inhibitor FIH throughout the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Zhang2">[64]</xref>. We recognize that there is a great deal of research efforts aimed to develop HIF inhibitors for cancer therapeutics, but concerns were recently raised about some serious problems that can arise from HIF inhibition in certain tissues and cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Rius1">[65]</xref>. Here our research further points out that HIF inhibition in the hypothalamus can result in adverse metabolic outcomes and needs to be avoided in drug designs. On the other hand, selective activation of neuronal HIF especially in the hypothalamus could be developed to provide a new therapeutic avenue against obesity and related metabolic disease. Neuron-specific HIF activation might not have critical concerns in terms of oncogenesis since neurons are non-replicable, but the potential application of this strategy in treating metabolic disease will certainly require future technology development and safety assessment.</p>

Animal tissues were homogenized, the proteins dissolved in a lysis buffer, and Western blot was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Zhang1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Cai1">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Cai2">[67]</xref>. Proteins dissolved in a lysis buffer were separated by SDS/PAGE and identified by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Primary antibodies included anti-HIF1α, anti-HIF2α, and anti-PHD2 (Novus Biologicals); anti-p300 (Santa Cruz); and anti-VHL, anti-pS6K, anti-S6K, anti-pAMPKα, anti-AMPKα, and anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies included HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Pierce). Western blots were quantified using NIH Image J software. Tissue histology: Various tissues were removed from mice and fixed in Bouin' solution (Sigma). Parafilm sections were prepared, stained with H&amp;E, and examined under a bright field microscope.</p>

        <title>GHO Assay and Biochemical Measurements</title>
        <p>PHD activity was determined using the GHO assay as established in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001112-Pan1">[42]</xref>. Briefly, a wheat germ in vitro transcription-translation (IVTT) system (Promega) was used to produce unhydroxylated HA-tagged GHO protein (substrate of PHDs). Hydroxylation of GHO protein was performed by incubation with hypothalamic protein lysates (dissolved in HEB buffer) at 37°C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mM ascorbate and 100 µM FeSO<sub>4</sub> (Sigma). The reaction was terminated by adding SDS loading buffer, and hydroxylated versus unhydroxylated GHO protein was separated by PAGE gels and detected by Western blot analysis of HA tag. Fumarate and succinate were measured using Fumarate Assay Kit (BioVison) and Succinic Acid Kit (Megazyme).</p>

        <title>Heart Perfusion, Immunostaining, and Imaging</title>
        <p>Mice under anesthesia were trans-heart perfused with 4% PFA, and the brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 4 h, and infiltrated in 20%–30% sucrose. Brain sections (20-µm thickness) were made using a cryostat at −20°C. For cell culture, cells were cultured in coverslips and fixed using 4% PFA. Fixed tissues or cells were blocked with serum of appropriate species, penetrated with 0.2% Triton-X 100, treated with primary antibodies including rabbit anti-HIF1α, anti-HIF2α (Novus Biologicals), anti-HIFβ (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-HuCD (Molecular Probes), and subsequently followed by a fluorescent reaction with Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Naïve IgGs of the appropriate species were used as negative controls. DAPI staining was used to reveal all the cells in the slides. A con-focal microscope was used to image fluorescence.</p>
