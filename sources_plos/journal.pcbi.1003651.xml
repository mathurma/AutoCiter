<abstract>
<p>Learning arises through the activity of large ensembles of cells, yet most of the data neuroscientists accumulate is at the level of individual neurons; we need models that can bridge this gap. We have taken spatial learning as our starting point, computationally modeling the activity of place cells using methods derived from algebraic topology, especially persistent homology. We previously showed that ensembles of hundreds of place cells could accurately encode topological information about different environments (“learn” the space) within certain values of place cell firing rate, place field size, and cell population; we called this parameter space the learning region. Here we advance the model both technically and conceptually. To make the model more physiological, we explored the effects of theta precession on spatial learning in our virtual ensembles. Theta precession, which is believed to influence learning and memory, did in fact enhance learning in our model, increasing both speed and the size of the learning region. Interestingly, theta precession also increased the number of spurious loops during simplicial complex formation. We next explored how downstream readout neurons might define co-firing by grouping together cells within different windows of time and thereby capturing different degrees of temporal overlap between spike trains. Our model's optimum coactivity window correlates well with experimental data, ranging from ∼150–200 msec. We further studied the relationship between learning time, window width, and theta precession. Our results validate our topological model for spatial learning and open new avenues for connecting data at the level of individual neurons to behavioral outcomes at the neuronal ensemble level. Finally, we analyzed the dynamics of simplicial complex formation and loop transience to propose that the simplicial complex provides a useful working description of the spatial learning process.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>One of the challenges in contemporary neuroscience is that we have few ways to connect data about the features of individual neurons with effects (such as learning) that emerge only at the scale of large cell ensembles. We are tackling this problem using spatial learning as a starting point. In previous work we created a computational model of spatial learning using concepts from the field of algebraic topology, proposing that the hippocampal map encodes topological features of an environment (connectivity) rather than precise metrics (distances and angles between locations)—more akin to a subway map than a street map. Our model simulates the activity of place cells as a rat navigates the experimental space so that we can estimate the effect produced by specific electrophysiological components —cell firing rate, population size, etc.—on the net outcome. In this work, we show that <italic>θ</italic> phase precession significantly enhanced spatial learning, and that the way downstream neurons group cells together into coactivity windows exerts interesting effects on learning time. These findings strongly support the notion that theta phase precession enhances spatial learning. Finally, we propose that ideas from topological theory provide a conceptually elegant description of the actual learning process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Considerable effort has been devoted over the years to understanding how the hippocampus is able to form an internal representation of the environment that enables an animal to efficiently navigate and remember the space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Schmidt1">[1]</xref>. This internal map is made possible, in part, by the activity of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus known as place cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-OKeefe1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Best1">[3]</xref>. As an animal explores a given environment, different place cells will fire in different, discrete regions of the space that are then referred to as that cell's “place field” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-OKeefe1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Best1">[3]</xref>. Despite decades of research, however, the features of the environment that are encoded, the identity of the downstream neurons that decode the information, and how the spiking activity of hundreds of cells is actually used to form the map all remain unclear.</p>
<p>We recently developed a computational model for spatial learning, focusing on what information is available to the still-unidentified downstream neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>. We reasoned that the information they decode must be encapsulated in the temporal patterns of the place cell spike trains, specifically place cell co-firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Curto1">[5]</xref>. Because place cell co-firing implies that the respective place fields overlap, the resulting map should derive from a sequence of overlaps between parts of the environment. The information encoded by the hippocampus would therefore emphasize connectivity between places in the environment, which is a topological rather than a geometric quality of space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>. One advantage of this line of reasoning is that a topological problem should be amenable to topological analysis, so we developed our model using conceptual tools from the field of algebraic topology and, in particular, persistent homology theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Zomorodian1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Zomorodian2">[7]</xref>. We simulated a rat exploring several topologically distinct environments and found that the information encoded by place cell co-firing can, in fact, reproduce the topological features of a given spatial environment. We also found that, in order to form an accurate spatial map within a biologically reasonable length of time, our simplified model hippocampus had to function within a certain range of values that turned out to closely parallel those obtained from actual experiments with healthy rodents. We called this sweet spot for spatial learning the learning region, L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>. As long as the values of the three parameters (firing rates, place field sizes, and number of active neurons) remain within the learning region, spatial learning is reliable and reproducible. Beyond the perimeters of L, however, spatial learning fails.</p>
<p>Several features of this model are intuitively appealing. First, the size and shape of L vary with the difficulty of the task: the greater the complexity of the space to be learned, the narrower the range of values that can sustain learning and thus the more compact the learning region. Second, there is a certain tolerance for variation among the three parameters within L: if one parameter begins to fall outside the sweet spot, spatial learning can still occur if there is sufficient compensation in the other two parameters. Our model suggests that certain diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's) or environmental toxins (e.g., ethanol, cannabinoids) disrupt spatial learning over time by gradually shifting mean neuronal function (place cell firing, neuronal number, or place field size) beyond the perimeter of the learning region. This notion receives support from studies of mouse models that show a correlation between impairment in spatial cognition and larger, more diffuse place fields, lower place cell firing rates, and smaller numbers of active cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Nithianantharajah1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Cacucci1">[9]</xref>. All this corresponds well with our subjective experiences of learning: the complexity of the task influences learning time; when the task is difficult we can feel we are at or just beyond the limits of our capacity; disease or intoxication can reveal limits in our spatial cognition that would normally be compensated for.</p>
<p>In this paper we focus on analyzing the structure of the learning region itself. We begin by making the computational model more physiologically accurate. There is a <italic>θ</italic> (theta) component of subcortical LFP oscillations that occurs in the frequency range of 6-12 Hz and regulates spiking activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Buzsaki1">[10]</xref>. The timing of place cell spiking in the hippocampus is coupled with the phase of <italic>θ-</italic>oscillations so that, as a rat progresses through a particular place field, the corresponding place cell discharges at a progressively earlier phase of each new <italic>θ</italic>-cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Skaggs1">[11]</xref>. This phenomenon, called theta phase precession, reproduces short sub-sequences of an animal's current trajectory during each <italic>θ-</italic>cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Skaggs1">[11]</xref>. This has been construed to suggest that <italic>θ-</italic>phase precession helps the hippocampus remember the temporal sequence of the rat's positions in a space (i.e., its trajectory) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Lisman1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Jensen1">[13]</xref>, thereby enhancing spatial learning and memory. If this is the case, <italic>θ</italic> phase precession should enhance learning in our computational model. Indeed, we find that it significantly improves and stabilizes spatial learning. We also find that different temporal windows to define co-firing exert a pronounced influence on learning time, and the most efficacious window widths correspond with experimental predictions. Finally, we analyze simplicial complex formation within the learning region, examining both the structure of the complexes and the dynamics of loop formation, and find an explanation for the poor efficiency of ensembles at the boundary of the learning region compared to peak-performing ensembles.</p>

<title>Concepts underlying the topological model for spatial learning</title>
<p>We will first briefly describe the fundamental concepts on which our model is based (this section is an abbreviated version of the approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>). Central to this work is the concept of a nerve simplicial complex, in which a space <italic>X</italic> is covered by a number of smaller, discrete regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dubrovin1">[14]</xref>. If two regions overlap, the corresponding vertices, <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>v<sub>j</sub></italic>, are considered connected by a 1<italic>D</italic> link <italic>v<sub>ij</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). If three regions overlap, then <italic>v<sub>ij</sub></italic>, <italic>v<sub>jk</sub></italic>, and <italic>v<sub>ki</sub></italic> support a 2<italic>D</italic> triangular facet or simplex <italic>σ<sub>ijk</sub></italic>, and so on as the number of overlaps and links increase. The structure of the simplicial complex approximates the structure of the environment: the complex N(<italic>X</italic>) obtained from a sufficiently dense cover of the space <italic>X</italic> will reproduce the correct topological indices of <italic>X</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref> for details). For our model we developed a temporal analogue to the simplicial complex, i.e., a simplicial complex that builds over time: when the animal is first introduced to the environment, there will be only a few data points from place cell firing, but as the animal explores the space the place cell firing data accumulate. (Rodent experiments indicate that place fields take about four minutes to develop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Frank1">[15]</xref>.) As the animal explores its environment and more place cells fire (and co-fire), the simplicial complex T grows with <italic>T</italic> (time) (T = T(<italic>T)</italic>). Eventually, after a certain minimal time <italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>, the space's topological characteristics will stabilize and produce the correct topological indices, at which point the topological information is complete. <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> is thus the minimal learning time, the time at which a topologically correct map is first formed.</p>

<title>A simplicial complex can be derived from place cell co-firing.</title>
<p>As an animal (in experiments, typically a rodent) explores a space, place cells fire in discrete locations that are mapped onto the space as place fields (<bold>b</bold>, colored ovals).

Čech) simplicial complex generated by the overlaps among place fields. To form a simplicial complex, each place field center is considered to be a vertex, and each link between vertices is a simplex. Each simplex <italic>σ<sub>ij</sub></italic> or <italic>σ<sub>ijk</sub></italic> is labeled to indicate the vertices linked, e.g., σ<sub>617</sub> indicates a link between vertices 6,1 and 7. (<bold>C</bold>) Persistent homology “barcodes” show the timelines of 0<italic>D</italic> and 1<italic>D</italic> loops, respectively: each colored horizontal line represents one 0<italic>D</italic> loop (top panel) or one 1<italic>D</italic> loop (bottom panel). The time <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> (dotted red vertical lines) marks the moment when spurious loops (topological ‘noise’) disappear and the correct number of loops persists, in this case one in 0<italic>D</italic> and one in 1<italic>D</italic>, indicating that there is one hole in the environment. Thus, <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> is the time after which the correct topological information emerges, which corresponds to the map formation or learning time in this environment, for this particular ensemble of place cells, operating under particular conditions of mean firing rate, mean place field size, number of cells in the population.</p>

<p>The correct topological indices are indicated by Betti numbers, which in turn are manifested in persistent cycles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Zomorodian2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Ghrist1">[16]</xref>). As the rat begins to explore an environment, the simplicial complex T(<italic>T</italic>) will consist mostly of 0-cycles that correspond to small groups of cofiring cells that mark contractible spatial domains. As the rat continues to explore the environment, the co-firing cells will produce links between the vertices of T(<italic>T</italic>), and higher-dimensional cycles will appear. As <italic>T</italic> increases, most cycles in each dimension will disappear as so much “topological noise,” leaving only a few persisting cycles that express stable topological information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). The persistent homology method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Zomorodian1">[6]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref> <bold>Methods</bold>) enables us to distinguish between cycles that persist across time (reflecting real topological characteristics) and transient cycles produced by the rat's behavior (e.g., circling in a particular spot during one trial or simply not venturing into one part of the space during early explorations). The pattern of cycles is referred to as a barcode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Ghrist1">[16]</xref> that can be easily read to give topological information about a given environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Zomorodian1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Zomorodian2">[7]</xref>.</p>

<title>Theta precession enhances spatial learning</title>
<p>If theta precession serves to enhance learning, as has been predicted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Robbe1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Winson1">[19]</xref>, then it should enhance spatial learning in our model. This could occur by any of several means. First, theta precession might enlarge the number of ensembles capable of the task by expanding the scope of the parameters (including firing rates or place field sizes normally out of the bounds of L). Second, it might make the ensembles that are in L converge on the correct topological information more rapidly. Third, it might make the same ensembles perform more reliably (e.g., succeeding in map formation a greater percentage of times in our simulations).</p>
<p>To test the effect of theta precession in our model, we compared the rates of map formation for those formed with and without <italic>θ-</italic>precession. We tested 1710 different place cell ensembles by independently varying the number of place cells (<italic>N</italic>; 19 independent values, from 50 to 500), the ensemble mean firing rate (<italic>f</italic>; 10 independent values, from 4 to 40), and the ensemble mean place field sizes (<italic>s</italic>; 9 independent values, from 5 to 30) [Methods; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref> and Methods therein for further details]. For statistical analysis, we simulated each map 10 times so that we could compute the mean learning time and its relative variability, <italic>ξ</italic> = Δ <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>/<italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>, for each set of (<italic>s</italic>, <italic>f</italic>, <italic>N</italic>) values. In the following we will suppress the bar in the notation for the mean <italic>f, s, N,</italic> and <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> shows the results of these simulations in a 1×1 m space with one hole. (The size of the environment in this study is smaller than the ones used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>, for two reasons: to avoid the potential problem of place cells with more than one field, and to reduce computational cost; see Methods.) The learning region L is small and sparse in the <italic>θ</italic>-off case, but notably larger and denser in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Values that would be just beyond the learning region—<italic>N</italic> that may be too small, or place fields that are too large or too small, or firing rates too high or too low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>—thus become functional with the addition of <italic>θ</italic>-precession.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Point clouds representing the mean learning times <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> computed for the <italic>θ</italic>-off case (left) and the maps driven by a <italic>θ</italic>–signal recorded in rat (right). Each point corresponds to a place cell ensemble with a specific number of place cells, <italic>N</italic>, the mean ensemble firing rate, <italic>f</italic>, the mean ensemble place field size <italic>s</italic>. Dark blue circles represent those ensembles that form correct topological maps most rapidly and reliably; as the color shades from blue through green, yellow, and red, the learning times increase and map formation becomes less reliable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>, Methods). The rat <italic>θ</italic>–signal enlarges the learning region L and speeds map formation. (<bold>B</bold>) To zero in on the effect of <italic>θ</italic> precession on the quality of learning, these clouds depict only the maps that converged at least 7 out of 10 times (<italic>ρ</italic> ≥0.7), and for which the variance of the learning times, <italic>ξ</italic> =  Δ<italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>/<italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>, did not exceed 30% of the mean value. Even in this more rigorously defined core of L, with ensembles that already function well, the <italic>θ</italic>–signal has a pronounced effect. (<bold>C</bold>) Histograms of the minimal times obtained in the <italic>θ</italic>-off (left) and the <italic>θ</italic>-driven case (right), fit by the GEV distribution. The blue dot marks the mode of the distribution; m in the center of each panel gives the value of the mode. All convergent maps are included. The typical learning time <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case is about half as long as in the <italic>θ</italic>-off case. (<bold>D</bold>) The same histograms obtained for the core of L (<italic>ρ</italic> ≥0.7, <italic>ξ</italic>≤0.3). The typical learning time <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case is about 6.5 minutes, whereas without <italic>θ</italic> it is 15% longer. (<bold>E</bold>) One of the major effects of <italic>θ</italic> phase precession is to reduce the variability of the learning times. The histograms show that the typical value of the relative variation <italic>ξ</italic> in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case is less than half that of the <italic>θ</italic>-off case, i.e., that repeated simulations of the <italic>θ</italic>-driven maps more reliably reproduce similar learning time values.</p>

<p>Two criteria reveal the quality of the map-forming ensembles: speed and consistency in converging toward the correct topological signature. The fastest map formation times (under 4 minutes) are represented by blue dots; as the color shifts toward red, map formation times become longer and the error rate (failure to converge) increases. The size of the dot represents the success rate: small dots represent ensembles that only occasionally converge on the correct information, large dots represent ensembles that converge most or all of the time. <italic>θ-</italic>precession increases the probability of convergence across all ensembles that can form accurate maps at all (<bold>Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003651.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). Since we were interested in understanding the dynamics of efficient learning, however, we created a more stringent definition of the learning region to focus on the core of L where map-formation is most rapid and reliable, as well as to make the results more legible (L can be quite dense, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref><bold> and Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003651.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>); if <italic>θ-</italic>precession truly enhances learning, its effect should be apparent even in the most successful ensembles, and indeed this was the case. The point clouds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref> depict those ensembles that formed maps with a convergence rate of <italic>ρ</italic>≥0.7 (i.e., those that produced correct topological information at least 70% of the time) and simultaneously had low relative variability of the <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> values, <italic>ξ</italic>&lt;0.3.

Moreover, the effects of adding <italic>θ-</italic>precession—reducing map formation time and decreasing the relative variability of the <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> values—were manifested in all maps, not just those with high (<italic>ρ</italic> ≥0.7) convergence rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g002"><bold>Figure 2C,D</bold></xref>).

<title>Theta precession makes spurious loops more transient</title>
<p>So far we have described the outcome of place cell ensemble activity in terms of the time at which the correct number of loops in the simplicial complex T emerges. But the learning process can also be described by how spurious loops are handled in the system. These loops are a fair representation of the subjective experience of learning. It takes time to build a framework into which new information can be properly slotted: until that framework is in place—whether it's a grasp of the layout of a neighborhood or the basic principles of a new field of study—we have incomplete hunches and many incorrect notions before experience (more learning) fills in our understanding. Translating this into topological terms, as the knowledge gaps close, the spurious loops contract. We therefore wanted to study the effects of theta precession on the dynamics of loop formation. Does a “smarter” ensemble form more spurious loops or fewer? Does it resolve those loops more quickly?</p>
<p>We concentrated on the 1<italic>D</italic> cycles, which represent path connectivity within the simplicial complex, because they are more numerous and thus produce more robust statistics than the 0<italic>D</italic> cycles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> shows that <italic>θ-</italic>precession shortened the duration of the spurious loops. The KS test reveals a statistically significant difference between the lifetimes of spurious loops in the <italic>θ</italic>-off case and those in all the <italic>θ</italic>-on cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). To simplify the presentation of the results produced by the statistically similar <italic>θ</italic>-on cases, we combined the data on spurious loop duration from all four <italic>θ</italic>-driven maps into a single histogram. It is interesting to note that the probability distributions for loop dynamics are typically better fit by the gamma distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g003"><bold>Figure 3B–D</bold></xref>). In the <italic>θ</italic>-driven maps, a typical spurious loop persisted for 50% less time than it would without <italic>θ-</italic>precession (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). It is worth noting that the spurious loops persisted longer at the lower boundary of the learning region, where the mean firing rates and place field sizes are smallest. This makes sense, insofar as whatever information appears will take longer to be corrected.</p>

Black squares indicate a significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) in loop duration between <italic>θ</italic>-off and all other cases; the <italic>p</italic>-values for pairwise comparisons between different <italic>θ</italic>-on cases reveal no significant difference (gray squares, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.2). The statistical similarity of all the <italic>θ</italic>-on distributions enabled us to combine the <italic>θ</italic>-on loop duration data to obtain better statistics for the histogram. The structure of the histograms is fit by the gamma distribution (blue lines). We used the smooth histogram profile (dashed line) to show that the typical duration of the topological loops in the <italic>θ</italic>-on cases is about half that of the <italic>θ</italic>-off case. (<bold>C</bold>) The typical number of loops in the <italic>θ</italic>-on cases is ∼40% higher than in the absence of <italic>θ</italic>-precession. The <italic>θ</italic>-off histogram is fit by the GEV distribution (red line), while the <italic>θ</italic>-on histogram is better fit by gamma distribution (blue).

<p>Statistical analysis of the largest number of loops observed at any given point over the course of the map formation period also differentiated <italic>θ</italic>-driven from <italic>θ</italic>-off maps. Curiously, <italic>θ</italic>-driven cases tended to produce a significantly higher mean number of spurious loops than the <italic>θ</italic>-off case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>), but with a lower peak number of loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). This implies that <italic>θ</italic>-precession enhances the speed of spatial learning overall at the price of creating more (transient) errors; lots of spurious loops are formed early on, but they disappear faster.

<title>Too many simplices make learning less efficient</title>
<p>In our model, spatial learning can be quantified by the time required for the emergence of correct topological information, but it can also be quantified by studying the simplicial complex itself. We noted earlier that the structure of the simplicial complex approximates the structure of the environment. Similarly, it is possible to conceive of a simplex as a mathematical analogue to a cell assembly (a group of at least two cells that repeatedly co-fire and form a synapse onto a readout neuron), and to view the simplicial complex as analogous to the realm of possible connections within the hippocampus. We were therefore curious: since it is in the interest of neural function to be efficient, how many cell assemblies (simplices) does it take to encode a given amount of information? We would predict that the fewer the connections, the better, for the sake of efficiency.</p>
<p>One of the major characteristics of a simplicial complex T is the number of <italic>n</italic>-dimensional simplices it contains, traditionally denoted as <italic>f<sub>n</sub></italic>. The list of all <italic>f<sub>n</sub></italic> –values, (<italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic>, …, <italic>f<sub>n</sub></italic>), is referred to as the <italic>f</italic>-vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Gromov1">[22]</xref>. Since the <italic>D</italic>-dimensional simplices in T correspond to (<italic>D</italic>+1)-ary connections, the number of which depends on the number of vertices, <italic>N</italic>, we considered the <italic>f<sub>n</sub></italic> values normalized by the corresponding binomial coefficients, <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003651.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003651.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>which characterize the number of simplices connecting vertices in the complex T. We can consider <italic>η</italic> an index of the connectivity of the simplicial complex. Since we model 2<italic>D</italic> spatial navigation, we analyzed the connections between two and three vertices, i.e., the 1<italic>D</italic> and 2<italic>D</italic> simplices, of T (the number of 0<italic>D</italic> simplexes normalized by the number of vertices in T is <italic>η<sub>0</sub></italic>≡1).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref> shows the distribution of the normalized number of simplices at the time the correct signature is achieved (<italic>η<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>η<sub>2</sub></italic>, for 1<italic>D</italic> and 2<italic>D</italic>, respectively). As expected, the number of simplices was smaller at the lower boundary of the learning region L (the base of the point cloud) and increased towards the top of L where place fields are larger and the firing rates are higher, each of which would produce more place cell co-firing events. Remarkably, the number of simplices depended primarily on the mean place field size and on the mean firing rate of the ensemble, and not on the number of cells within the ensemble. This suggests a certain universality in the behavior of place cell ensembles that is independent of their population size. In the ensembles with smaller place fields and lower firing rates, about 1.5% of place cell pairs and 1.7% of the triplets were connected, and this was enough to encode the correct topological information, whereas in the ensembles with low spatial selectivity and higher firing rates, 25% of pairs and 8% of triplets were connected. These ensembles, in which the place fields and spike trains will by definition have a lot of overlap, are forced to form many more 1<italic>D</italic> and 2<italic>D</italic> simplices in order to encode the same amount of information and are thus less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>, third column).</p>

In the ensembles with high firing rates and low spatial selectivity, up to 25% of place cell pairs and up to 8% of place cell triplets are coactive.

<p>According to our model, such ensembles and the hippocampal networks whose activity they represent are inefficient on two counts. First, these larger, more complex temporal simplicial complexes (analogous to a larger number of coactive cell groups) will take longer to form correct topological information, if they can manage it at all. Second, a larger number of coactive place cells would hamper the training of downstream readout neurons, thereby impeding reliable encoding of spatial information. This is consistent with studies showing that the number of cells participating in a particular task decreases until it reaches an optimal number that fire at a slightly higher rate than their no-longer-participating neighbors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Karlsson1">[23]</xref>.</p>

<title>Window size: Defining what constitutes co-firing</title>
<p>Our model depends on patterns of place cell co-firing, but we had not previously explored what the optimal temporal window for defining co-activity might be. Experimental work supports the widely held assumption that the temporal unit for defining coactivity ranges between tens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Harris1">[24]</xref> and hundreds of milliseconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Ang1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Buzsaki2">[27]</xref>. Our model, however, enables us to approach the question of optimal width for the coactivity window theoretically. Clearly, if the time window <italic>w</italic> is too small, then the spike trains produced by the presynaptic place cells will often “miss” one another, and the map will either require a long time to emerge or it may not be established at all. One would thus expect large values <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>(<italic>w</italic>) for a small <italic>w</italic>. On the other hand, if <italic>w</italic> is too large, it will allow cells whose place fields are actually distant from one another to be grouped together, yielding incorrect topological information. Theta rhythm itself will have a tendency to group sequential spike trains together, but clearly there must be limits to this, or else some place cells would be read downstream as co-firing when they actually are not. Therefore, there should exist an optimal value of <italic>w</italic> that reliably produces a finite, biologically relevant learning time <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> at which the learning region L is robust and stable.</p>
<p>We assume that the capability of a read-out neuron to detect place cell co-activity is specified by a single parameter, the width of the integration time window <italic>w</italic>, over which the co-appearance of the spike trains is detected. (We considered the possible effect of time bin position on co-activity, but found this did not affect outcome; see <bold>Methods</bold>.) We defined cell coactivity as follows: if presynaptic neurons <italic>c<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>c<sub>2</sub></italic> send a signal to a read-out neuron within a certain time window <italic>w</italic>, their activity will be interpreted as contemporaneous. The width of this time window may be positive (<italic>c<sub>2</sub></italic> becomes active <italic>w</italic> seconds after <italic>c<sub>1</sub></italic>) or negative (<italic>c<sub>2</sub></italic> becomes active while <italic>c<sub>1</sub></italic> is still firing). We studied window widths <italic>w</italic> for which the place cell spike trains would eventually be able to produce the correct topological signature (the Betti numbers, see <bold>Methods</bold> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>). In order to describe the dependence of learning times on the window width, <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>(<italic>w</italic>), we scanned an array of 24 values of <italic>w</italic> (ranging from 0.1 to 5 <italic>θ</italic>-periods) for each combination of the parameters (mean <italic>s, f</italic>, and <italic>N</italic>) and noted the width of the value <italic>w<sub>o</sub></italic>, at which the map began to produce the correct topological signature. We call this initial correct window width the “opening” value. A typical result is provided by an ensemble with <italic>f</italic> = 28 Hz, <italic>s</italic> = 23 cm and <italic>N</italic> = 350, in which an accurate topological map emerges at a fairly small window width, <italic>w<sub>o</sub></italic>∼25 <italic>msec</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>).

The radius of the circles indicates the percentage of times the map converges on correct information (the larger the radius, the greater percentage of convergence). In both cases, the first convergence to the correct signature occurs as the window widens to about <italic>w<sub>o</sub></italic> = 0.2 <italic>θ</italic>-periods (one <italic>θ</italic>-period is approximately 125 msec). At this “opening” value the learning time is about 300 mins, which is about 60 times higher than the typical value obtained for a time window of two <italic>θ</italic>-periods. The learning time <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> at the “opening” values of <italic>w</italic> is highly sensitive to variations of <italic>w</italic>: as <italic>w</italic> changes from 0.2 to 0.3 <italic>θ-</italic>periods, the learning time <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> changes by over 300%. As the integration time <italic>w</italic> increases, the dependence <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>(<italic>w</italic>) rapidly drops off until it plateaus at about <italic>w<sub>s</sub></italic>∼1.5 <italic>θ</italic>-periods, where it stabilizes. As <italic>w</italic> increases further, the learning time <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> does not change significantly, but learning becomes less and less reliable, i.e., the likelihood of the spatial map converging to accurate topological information drops. Finally, the neuronal ensemble fails to encode the correct topological information at <italic>w</italic> ??? 4.5 <italic>θ</italic>-periods. (<bold>B</bold>) The dependence of the learning time on <italic>w</italic> shown above suggests that <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> is inversely proportional to a power of the window width, <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> = <italic>C/w<sup>α</sup></italic>, where <italic>α</italic> and <italic>C</italic> are constants.

The results show that the product <italic>T<sub>min</sub> w<sup>α</sup></italic> remains bounded for the entire range of window sizes. While in the <italic>θ</italic>-off case the variation of the product <italic>T<sub>min</sub> w<sup>α</sup></italic> remains large, the <italic>θ</italic>-on case it is nearly constant, which suggests that a nearly hyperbolic relationship <italic>T<sub>min</sub> w<sup>α</sup></italic> = <italic>C</italic> is more tight in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case.</p>

<p>As expected, the values of learning times at <italic>w<sub>o</sub></italic> were rather large: <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>(<italic>w<sub>o</sub></italic>) ∼20 minutes in <italic>θ</italic>-off case and <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>(<italic>w<sub>o</sub></italic>) ∼30 minutes in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case, and in some cases exceeding one hour (mostly for the ensembles with low firing rates).

The distribution of the <italic>w<sub>s</sub></italic> values demonstrates that in the <italic>θ</italic>-off case the stabilization is typically achieved at approximately one <italic>θ</italic>-period, and in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case at about ∼1.2–1.5 <italic>θ</italic>-cycles <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>), which justifies our choice of a two <italic>θ-</italic>period window width for the computations and corresponds well with the predicted limit of 150 msec for <italic>θ</italic>-cycle cofiring in sequence coding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Diba1">[29]</xref>.

If <italic>θ-</italic>signal is blocked by lesioning the medial septum (which does not affect hippocampal place cell representations), it severely impairs memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Givens1">[37]</xref> and the acquisition of new spatial information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Leutgeb1">[38]</xref>. Recent experiments demonstrate more directly that destroying <italic>θ</italic> precession by administering cannabinoids to rats correlates with behavioral and spatial learning deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Robbe1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Robbe2">[39]</xref>. But at what level, and through what mechanisms, does <italic>θ</italic> precession exert its influence? The effect of <italic>θ-</italic>precession on the structure of the spike trains is rather complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Harris2">[40]</xref>. On the one hand, it groups cell spikes closer together in time and enforces specific sequences of cell firing, which is typically interpreted as increasing the temporal coherence of place cell activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Lee1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Geisler1">[43]</xref>. One might predict that grouping spikes together would (somehow) speed up learning. On the other hand, <italic>θ-</italic>precession imposes extra conditions on the spike timing that depend on <italic>θ-</italic>phase and on the rat's location with respect to the center of the place field through which it is presently moving. Since every neuron precesses independently, one could just as well predict that <italic>θ</italic> modulation would either restrict or enlarge the pool of coactivity events, which in turn would slow down learning at the level of the downstream networks, and that the beneficial effect of the <italic>θ</italic> rhythm is a higher-order phenomenon that occurs elsewhere in the brain.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that <italic>θ</italic> precession may not just correlate with, but actually be a mechanism for, enhancing spatial learning and memory. The interplay of <italic>θ</italic> precession and window width, especially the extremely long learning times at the opening window width <italic>w<sub>o</sub></italic>, is particularly illuminating here. As noted, theta precession acts at both the ensemble and the individual neuron level: it groups spikes together, but each neuron precesses independently. When the time window is sufficiently wide, the coactivity events are reliably captured, the first effect dominates, and the main outcome of theta precession is to supply grouped spikes to downstream neurons. For very small time windows, however, the system struggles to capture events as coactive, and the extra condition imposed by phase precession acts as an impediment: detected coactivities are rarer, and learning slows down. Put more simply, imagine in <bold>Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003651.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold> that the window is only one spike wide: in a train of 10 spikes that overlaps by one spike with another train, it will take 10 windows before the overlap is detected.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the presence of theta precession was clearly more important than the details of the oscillation. Although theta precession enhanced learning in our simulations, learning times were relatively insensitive to the details of the theta precession chosen. One might expect differences in spike train structure induced by the four different <italic>θ</italic>-signals studied to alter the dynamics of the persistent loops and thus learning efficiency. Our results show, however, that differences that would matter at the level of individual cells are averaged out at the level of a large ensemble of cells.</p>
<p>Here again the model shows its particular strength: it allows us to correlate parameters of activity at the level of individual neurons with the outcome at the level of an ensemble of hundreds of cells, providing a framework for understanding how micro-level changes play out at the behavioral level. Interestingly, we also saw a difference between the micro and macro levels when we considered whether the placement of a temporal window affected what would be considered co-activity (see <bold>Methods</bold> and <bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003651.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold>). In theory it should, but the effect at the macro level washes out and we found that only the temporal width of the window matters for learning time.</p>

<title>Simplicial complex formation as a metaphor for learning</title>
<p>Beyond validating the model as a reliable way to study physiological aspects of spatial learning, we have gone further in this work to analyze the simplicial complex itself as a way of describing learning. As a rat starts to explore an environment, some cells begin to form place fields. Then, the co-firing of two or more place cells will define the respective places as connected in space and temporal experience and will create corresponding simplices in the simplicial complex T. With time, these simplices form a chain corresponding to the animal's route through the space. If the environment is bounded, the rat will discover new connections between the same places (arriving to the same location via different routes). As a result, the chains of connected simplices grow together to form loops. Existing loops become thicker and may eventually “close up” and disappear, yielding surfaces. The appearance of such surfaces is significant: the closing up of a <italic>D</italic>-dimensional surface corresponds to the contraction, or disappearance, of one of its boundaries, which itself is a <italic>D</italic>1-dimensional loop. Eventually, the structure of the simplicial complex saturates such that no new simplices (connections between places) are produced and no more loops contract because all that could close have already closed. At this point, the saturated simplicial complex T encodes not only the possible locations of the rat, but also connections between the locations, along with the information about how these connections can be deformed, e.g., whether they are contractible or whether they encircle an obstacle and cannot be contracted into a point. Thus, the saturated temporal simplicial complex T is a framework that unifies information about places and spatial-temporal relationships between them. This framework might correspond fairly well to the structure formed by synaptic connectivity in the rat's hippocampus, which allows the rat to explore and retrieve information by “pinging” the network, without physical navigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Hopfield1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the practical benefits of a model that consistently produces biologically relevant results, there is a special appeal in the ability of algebraic topology to provide insight into the mechanisms of learning. It is fitting that a method developed to simplify the analysis of high-dimensional data with many coordinates might itself represent how the brain approaches a similar challenge in the real world.</p>

This observation helps to reduce the computational cost of the algorithm. In addition, simulating the maps in smaller environments allows us to avoid multiply connected, “patchy” place fields (in smaller environments there is a lesser chance of observing more than one component of a place field, as occasionally happens when a place cell fires in more than one place) and helps to bring the density of place cells closer to experimental values.</p>

<title>Additional temporal coactivity parameters</title>
<p>Finally, we notice that, given a particular integration time window width <italic>w</italic>, the co-activity between two specific spike trains may or may not be detected depending on the position of the time bins (<bold>Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003651.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>).

This implies that <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> does not depend on the shift of the time window: over the typical learning time scale, the effect produced by the bin shifts averages out. Second, it is clear that a fixed time width is not physiological, because a realistic window size will “jitter” from cell to cell and from moment to moment. However, a direct simulation conducted for <italic>w</italic> equal to two <italic>θ-</italic>periods shows that adding up to 50% “jitter” to the window width does not affect the learning times: <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> remains virtually invariant with respect to the amplitude of the bin size noise.

<title>Reducing computational cost by subdividing maps</title>
<p>One of the major computational difficulties in simulating hippocampal spatial maps is the time it takes to analyze a large number of simplices: in our original paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Dabaghian1">[4]</xref>, simulating the map formation time for each set of parameters (each variation tested 10,000 times) took several months for a 2×2 m virtual space.

Due to restrictions in computational power, we can investigate ensembles that include up to 400 cells, but in the actual hippocampus there are on the order of 4000 cells active in a given experimental environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Amaral1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Samsonovich1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>To reduce the computational load, we took advantage of the Meyer-Vietoris theorem, which allows us to simulate the map by breaking it into its constituent parts. Using Meyer-Vietoris, it is possible to compute the homological characteristics of the entire space <italic>X</italic> from the homological characteristics of its constituent parts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003651-Hatcher1">[46]</xref>. Specifically, if a space <italic>X</italic> is split into pieces <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, <italic>X</italic> = <italic>A</italic>∪<italic>B</italic>, then the homologies of <italic>X</italic>, <italic>H<sub>q</sub></italic>(<italic>X</italic>), are related to the homologies of its parts, <italic>H<sub>q</sub></italic>(<italic>A</italic>) and <italic>H<sub>q</sub></italic>(<italic>B</italic>), via the so-called long exact sequence:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003651.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003651.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>If the overlap, <italic>A</italic>∩<italic>B</italic>, is topologically trivial, <italic>H<sub>q</sub></italic>(<italic>A</italic>∩<italic>B</italic>)<italic> = 0</italic>, then the sequence reduces to just<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003651.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003651.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>in which case the exactness of homomorphisms implies that<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003651.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003651.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>i.e., the homologies of the whole space are equal to the direct sum of the homologies of its parts. As a consequence, the Betti numbers from both <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> can be combined to accurately provide topological information about the whole space <italic>X</italic>.</p>
<p>This observation can be used to divide the map formation times of the temporal simplicial complex T(<italic>T</italic>). If our virtual rat spends time <italic>T<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>B</sub></italic> in part <italic>A</italic> and in part <italic>B</italic>, respectively, then assuming that <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> meet but do not overlap, the total map formation time for the whole environment, <italic>T<sub>X</sub></italic>, can be estimated as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003651.e008"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003651.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>A more complete discussion of the mathematical aspects of this dividing approach will be given elsewhere; for example, there is a scale at which space can be no further atomized, and this will require considerable effort to define the size of these ‘atoms’ and account for these size limits. (At present, it appears that an atom of space is approximately the size of two to three place fields.) Here we present some numerical results justifying the piecewise computations (<bold>Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003651.s009">Figure S9</xref></bold>). We simulated the rat's movement in a large 2×2 m environment with two holes, which we formally divided into 2, 3 or 4 parts. After the fragments have been chosen, we counted the time spent in each region, and, by using only the spikes fired within a given region computed each region's own learning times. <bold>Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003651.s009">Figure S9</xref></bold> shows that the sum of these times is similar to total time spent by rat in the entire arena (the differences are not statistically significant).

<p><bold>Learning time is inversely proportional to a power of the window width.</bold> The test of the hypothesized inverse proportionality dependence between the learning time, <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic>, and the window width, <italic>w</italic>, <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> = <italic>C/w<sup>α</sup></italic>, where <italic>α</italic> and <italic>C</italic> are constants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003651-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). To test this hypothesis, we selected the maps that converged for at least 19 out of 24 values of <italic>w</italic>, and computed the product <italic>T<sub>min</sub> w<sup>α</sup></italic> for 12 values of <italic>α</italic> taken from the interval 1&lt;<italic>α</italic>&lt;2. The results show that the product <italic>T<sub>min</sub> w<sup>α</sup></italic> remains bounded for the entire range of <italic>α</italic> values. While in the <italic>θ</italic>-off case (colormap “cool”) the variation of the product <italic>T<sub>min</sub> w<sup>α</sup></italic> remains large, in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case (colormap “hot”) it is nearly constant, which suggests that a nearly hyperbolic relationship <italic>T<sub>min</sub> w<sup>α</sup></italic> = <italic>C</italic> holds in both cases. The smallest variation is achieved for <italic>α</italic> = 1.4 in the <italic>θ</italic>-on case and <italic>α</italic> = 1.28 in the <italic>θ</italic>-off case. Notice that as <italic>α</italic> varies between 1 and 2, the arms of the curve flip so the “most horizontal” position is achieved for 1&lt;<italic>α</italic><sup>Δ</sup>&lt;2.</p>

<p><bold>Window widths define what counts as co-activity.</bold> While overlap patterns <bold>A</bold> and C do not depend on the position of the time bins, activity of cells in close temporal succession might, in theory, be interpreted as coactivity or not depending on the position of the time bins and/or the size of the window width (<bold>B</bold>).
