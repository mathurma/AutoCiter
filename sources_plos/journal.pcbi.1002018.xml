        <p>The Warburg effect - a classical hallmark of cancer metabolism - is a counter-intuitive phenomenon in which rapidly proliferating cancer cells resort to inefficient ATP production via glycolysis leading to lactate secretion, instead of relying primarily on more efficient energy production through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as most normal cells do. The causes for the Warburg effect have remained a subject of considerable controversy since its discovery over 80 years ago, with several competing hypotheses. Here, utilizing a genome-scale human metabolic network model accounting for stoichiometric and enzyme solvent capacity considerations, we show that the Warburg effect is a direct consequence of the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to increase biomass production rate. The analysis is shown to accurately capture a three phase metabolic behavior that is observed experimentally during oncogenic progression, as well as a prominent characteristic of cancer cells involving their preference for glutamine uptake over other amino acids.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cancer cells, as opposed to normal cells, produce a substantial amount of energy inefficiently via aerobic glycolysis, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen to support mitochondrial respiration. Despite the fact that this phenomenon, called the Warburg effect, has already been discovered back in 1924, its causes remain poorly understood. Here we utilize a genome-scale human metabolic network model and show that by accounting for cellular capacity for metabolic enzymes, the Warburg effect is a direct consequence of cancer cells' adaptation to fast proliferation. We demonstrate that our model accurately captures several metabolic phenotypes observed experimentally during cancer development, as well as the preference of cancer cells to glutamine uptake over other amino acids.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Warburg effect, a phenomenon discovered by Otto Warburg in 1924, reflects a shift to an inefficient metabolism in cancer cells, in which an increase in the inefficient production of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) via glycolysis leads to the secretion of non-oxidized carbons in the form of lactate, even in the presence of oxygen (termed <italic>aerobic glycolysis</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Warburg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Warburg2">[2]</xref>. Specifically, aerobic glycolysis allows the production of only 2 ATP molecules per one glucose molecule, whereas oxidative phosphorylation permits the generation of 32 ATP molecules per one molecule of glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Lehninger1">[3]</xref>. Nevertheless, the importance of aerobic glycolysis to cancer cells has been experimentally demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Schulz1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Ristow1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Over the years, several hypotheses were raised regarding the potential cause of the Warburg effect: (i) Defective mitochondrion hypothesis – suggesting that cancer cells have defective mitochondria and hence rely on glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Warburg3">[6]</xref>, however subsequent research revealed that mitochondrial function is not impaired in most cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Funes1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Mori1">[8]</xref>. (ii) Hypoxia– suggesting that tumor hypoxia selects for cells dependent on anaerobic metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Gatenby1">[9]</xref>, but previous studies have shown that cancer cells already resort to aerobic glycolysis before exposure to hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Gottschalk1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Elstrom1">[11]</xref>. (iii) Avoiding ROS-mediated DNA damage – it was suggested that reducing oxidative phosphorylation in proliferating cells due to the Warburg shift reduces ROS and hence protects cells from DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Chiaradonna1">[12]</xref>. (iv) A game theoretical approach suggesting that the Warburg effect occurs as glycolysis provides higher ATP production rate than oxidative phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Pfeiffer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Pfeiffer2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Schuster1">[15]</xref>. (v) An approach suggesting that a trade-off between the enzyme-synthesis costs and the ATP production yields of the different pathways that catabolize carbon sources may cause the Warburg effect: the high-yield oxidative phosphorylation pathway also has high enzyme costs, leading to a sub-optimal ATP production strategy, as it has lower production rates than glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Molenaar1">[16]</xref>. (vi) Metabolic adaptation to fast proliferation - it was argued that as opposed to metabolism in differentiated cells that is geared towards efficient ATP production, the aerobic glycolysis observed in cancer cells is adapted to facilitate biomass accumulation and high proliferation. Accordingly, in order to satisfy the requirements of anabolic metabolism in addition to the production of ATP, nutrients must be used to generate both the carbon building blocks of macromolecules and the reducing power needed for biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-VanderHeiden1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previous computational investigations of the Warburg effect studied the role of either energy or biomass production in causing the Warburg effect, focusing solely on central carbon metabolism. For example, the study of Vander Heiden <italic>et al.</italic> manually computed the metabolic requirements for producing one essential biomass precursor, palmitate (a major constituent of cellular membranes) considering the stoichiometry of a few central metabolic pathways. They found that aerobic glycolysis enables maximal palmitate production yield due to specific reducing power requirements. In another recent study, Vazquez <italic>et al.</italic> employed a schematic model of ATP production in human cells (considering two lumped reactions representing aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation), elegantly showing that a switch to aerobic glycolysis should result from cellular maximization of ATP production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez1">[18]</xref>. Their schematic model accounts not only for the stoichiometry of glycolysis and oxidative phosphyrylation but also for the enzyme-volumetric costs of activating these pathways (the latter bounded by the total cellular solvent capacity, also known as a <italic>macromolecular crowding</italic> constraint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Schuster2">[19]</xref>). A similar approach was previously employed in the study of over-flow metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Beg1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez2">[21]</xref>. Another interesting theory explaining overflow metabolism was suggested by Molenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, where the production costs of the metabolic enzymes involved were accounted for in a self-replicating model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Molenaar1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we study the causes of the Warburg effect by accounting for both energy production and anabolism of essential biomass constituents, in a genome-scale stoichiometric network model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Duarte1">[22]</xref> employing enzyme solvent capacity constraints. The usage of a large-scale metabolic network is essential if one aims to correctly account for the inter-connectivity of pathways that produce the various energy and biomass precursors required for proliferation, rather than examining just single factors in isolation, as has been previously performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-VanderHeiden1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez1">[18]</xref>. Towards this goal, we rely on a constraint-based modeling (CBM) framework that serves to analyze the function of metabolic networks by solely relying on simple physical-chemical constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Price1">[23]</xref>. CBM has already been successfully used in the past to predict the metabolic state of various microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Feist1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Mo1">[25]</xref>, and recently for studying human cellular metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Duarte1">[22]</xref>. The potential clinical utility of the human CBM model was previously demonstrated by its ability to identify functionally related sets of reactions that are causally related to hemolytic anemia, and potential drug targets for treating hypercholesterolemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Duarte1">[22]</xref>, to predict metabolic biomarkers in inborn errors of metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Shlomi1">[26]</xref> and to predict a variety of metabolic behaviors of different human tissues, including the brain, liver, kidney and more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Shlomi2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Jerby1">[28]</xref>. Our analysis shows that while strictly stoichiometric considerations are insufficient for explaining the Warburg effect, the incorporation of enzyme solvent capacity constraints successfully predicts the emergence of the Warburg effect. The analysis is shown to accurately predict an experimentally observed metabolic trajectory occurring during oncogenic progression, as well as the preference of cancer cells for a high rate of glutamine uptake.</p>

        <title>Metabolic requirements of cellular proliferation subject to enzyme solvent capacity constraints lead to the Warburg effect</title>
        <p>We utilized a genome-scale human metabolic network that includes 3,742 reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Duarte1">[22]</xref>, adding a pseudo <italic>biomass reaction</italic> that represents the production of a pre-defined set of essential biomass precursors required for cellular proliferation, as conventionally done in Flux Balance Analysis (FBA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Varma1">[29]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The biomass precursors include amino-acids, nucleotides, deoxy-nucleotides, ATP, lipids, etc (based on prior knowledge of their relative concentrations; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). In our simulations, we assume a minimal growth medium with glucose as a carbon source, as glucose is known to serve as a major fuel in cancer cells (below and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref> we show that qualitatively similar results were obtained when considering also the presence of an additional major nutrient taken by cancer cells, glutamine).</p>
        <p>To predict plausible metabolic fluxes in cancer, we first employed a standard FBA method to identify a feasible flux distribution that satisfies stoichiometric mass-balance, while maximizing biomass production yield (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We found that the predicted flux distribution does not display the prime characteristic of the Warburg effect, <italic>i.e.</italic> lactate secretion (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref>). Interestingly, this finding is in accordance with a previous study showing a conceptually similar failure of FBA to predict the Crabtree effect in yeast, in which glucose is fermented into ethanol under aerobic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Famili1">[30]</xref>. Thus, stoichiometric considerations alone are insufficient for explaining the Warburg effect and its relation to the metabolic requirements of highly proliferating cells. Notably, these results stand in difference from those presented by Vander Heiden <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-VanderHeiden1">[17]</xref>, claiming that strictly stoichiometric considerations directly lead to the Warburg effect due to metabolic demands for cellular proliferation.</p>
        <p>A strictly stoichiometric analysis, such as the one presented above, implicitly assumes that metabolic flux rates can be tuned to achieve high biomass production yields, without considering constraints imposed by enzyme concentrations and catalytic rates, which are prime determinants of metabolic flux. Specifically, while cells might be free to regulate enzyme concentrations according to metabolic demands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-VanderHeiden1">[17]</xref>, the total enzymes' concentration in the proliferating cells is bounded by the cell's solvent capacity, quantifying the maximum amount of macromolecules that can occupy the intracellular space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez1">[18]</xref>. To account for the functional effects of this additional fundamental constraint, we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez2">[21]</xref> and extend our stoichiometric genome-scale CBM analysis to compute for each enzyme the concentration required to facilitate the predicted flux, utilizing data on known human enzyme catalytic rates (taken from the literature; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This modeling approach enables the prediction of metabolic flux distributions that maximize the biomass production rate and concomitantly obey the solvent capacity constraints – rather than predicting flux distributions that only maximize the biomass production yield as done in standard FBA.</p>
        <p>We applied the approach described above (FBA with solvent capacity constraint) to predict human cellular flux distributions that maximize the biomass production rate. To simulate varying growth rates we performed the optimization across a wide range of different glucose uptake rates. Indeed, under these combined sets of constraints we find that biomass yield does decline at high growth rates – in accordance with the Warburg effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-VanderHeiden1">[17]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Specifically, the predicted metabolic behavior manifests three distinct growth phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1b</xref>): <italic>(i) optimal yield metabolism</italic> at a growth rate that is below 43% of the maximal possible rate, characterized by low glycolytic vs. high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, phase I), with low oxygen uptake rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1b</xref>, phase I<italic>). (ii) Intermediate yield metabolism</italic> at growth rate between 43-92%, characterized by increased glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, phase II), the latter involving a significantly increased oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1b</xref>, phase II). Notably, our prediction for an intermediate phase, involving increased oxygen consumption, presents a remarkable resemblance to two recent experimental studies examining the metabolic activity at different oncogenic progression stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-deGroof1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Ramanathan1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). Neither the stoichiometric model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-VanderHeiden1">[17]</xref> nor an analysis using the schematic model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez1">[18]</xref> give rise to similar predictions. <italic>(iii) Low yield metabolism</italic> at a growth rate above 92% of the maximal possible growth rate, characterized by a sharp increase in glycolytic flux and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation (and hence of O<sub>2</sub> uptake). The increase in aerobic glycolysis flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, phase III) leads to a rise in lactate secretion rates - a prime characteristic of the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1b</xref>, phase III).</p>

            <p>The axes (A, B) describe the growth rate obtained from flux distributions A and B, respectively. The blue lines represent two different constraints on the glucose uptake rate, and the red line represents the maximal concentration constraint. Green dashed lines are the contours of the growth rate maximization objective function – the further the line is from the origin, the higher the growth rate. When the glucose uptake U is limiting (dark grey feasible region), the maximal growth rate is obtained via A only (Solution 1; left green diamond). When both the uptake and the enzyme concentration constraints are limiting (light grey feasible region), maximal growth rate (G) is obtained via a combination of A and B (Solution 2; right green diamond), resulting in a shift to a less efficient metabolism and lactate secretion. This can be explained by the fact that the slope of the growth-rate (middle green) line (-1) is larger than the slope of the enzyme concentration limit (red) line (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), that is the yield-to-cost ratio of flux distribution B is greater than that of flux distribution A (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>

        <p>Concretely, analyzing the results of our model, flux distribution <italic>A</italic> stands for a typical metabolic state in phase I, which is characterized by high mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, with a high growth yield of 0.094 and a high cost of 0.302 (with a yield to cost ratio of 0.31). Flux distribution B stands for a typical metabolic state at phase III, which involves a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, with a low growth yield of 0.035 and a low cost of 0.050 (yield to cost ratio  =  0.7). These values indeed transcribe to a higher growth yield per unit of concentration cost of the enzymes participating in B, as alluded above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that, indeed, at low growth rates the glucose uptake rate is the sole limiting factor and hence the high yield oxidative phosphorylation route is taken; in contrast, at higher growth rates, the enzyme concentration constraint takes effect, and mixed solutions involving lactate secretion are necessarily formed. Notably, the predicted flux distributions across the range of growth rates described in this paper cannot be obtained from linear combinations of just two states (as in the above simplified example), but are rather composed of multiple flux distributions with different growth yields per concentration cost (as evident for example by the non-linear curve showing the predicted oxygen uptake rates across growth rates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g001">Figure 1b</xref>).

        <title>Metabolic adaptation to fast proliferation leads to a preference to high glutamine uptake rates</title>
        <p>The role of glutamine in cancer has been a topic of major interest as cancer cells are known to have a significant high glutamine uptake rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-DeBerardinis1">[34]</xref>. Repeating the previous analyses in the presence of both glucose and glutamine in the growth media shows qualitatively similar results to those described above.

To investigate the preference of cancer cells specifically to glutamine over other amino-acids, we applied FBA analysis to predict the contribution of each amino-acid separately to biomass production in the human model that accounts for enzyme solvent capacity constraints (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We find that, indeed, the contribution of glutamine to the proliferation rate is markedly higher than that of all other amino-acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We further show that this result is robust to changing the bound on maximal amino-acid uptake rate, and that it remains valid across a large number of random samplings of enzyme turnover rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref>). Repeating this analysis without accounting for enzyme solvent capacity constraints (<italic>i.e.</italic> by considering only the network stoichiometry in the vanilla FBA model) fails to predict the preference for glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002018-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

        <p>We carefully examined the flux distribution obtained with glutamine in the growth medium (achieving a growth rate of 0.062 1/h) vs. the one obtained with glutamate (growth rate  =  0.056 1/h). Interestingly, when glutamate is present in the medium, a large quantity of it is transformed into glutamine in an ATP consuming reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2). This satisfies the glutamine biomass requirement as well as the production of nucleotide precursors, among others. When removing the ATP requirement from this reaction, the growth rate achieved with glutamate in the medium increases to 0.059 1/h, which explains 50% of the growth rate difference. Notably, while this provides some intuitive explanation for the predicted preference for glutamine, we cannot identify a simple explanation for the entire effect due to the high complexity of the network model employed.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Metabolic adaptation to elevated growth requirements during cancer development has been recently suggested as the possible cause of the Warburg effect, a long-standing enigma of cancer metabolism. In this work we rigorously study this hypothesis using a genome-scale human metabolic model and demonstrate that stoichiometric considerations solely are insufficient to explain the shift to inefficient metabolism, in difference from recent claims <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-VanderHeiden1">[17]</xref>. However, integrating these constraints in a genome-scale model of human metabolism together with a constraint on enzyme solvent capacity does lead to the emergence of the Warburg effect at high proliferation rates. Furthermore, it accurately predicts a three phase metabolic behavior experimentally observed during oncogenic progression, as well as a marked preference to a high uptake rate of glutamine.</p>
      <p>The importance of enzyme solvent capacity in metabolic modeling has already been recognized in the earlier work of Beg <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Beg1">[20]</xref>, where applying such a constraint to the <italic>E. coli</italic> model improved phenotypic predictions. In their work, however, Beg <italic>et al.</italic> assumed an upper bound on the total cell-volume occupied by metabolic enzymes, as opposed to the method introduced here where we assume a bound on the enzyme mass per cell mass (<italic>i.e.</italic> a bound on enzyme fractional concentration). In order to account for enzyme volumes, Beg <italic>et al.</italic> estimated enzyme volumes by assuming a uniform <italic>specific volume</italic> parameter (representing the ratio between enzyme mass and volume) for all enzymes. Here, we employed a simpler approach that does not depend on specific volume estimations, and explicitly constrains the total sum of enzyme mass. Notably, we further tested the effect of accounting for volumes instead of masses, and obtained results which are very similar to those obtained with masses only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>In a recent study by Molenaar <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Molenaar1">[16]</xref>, a metabolic shift at high growth rates was predicted based on a general self-replicating model. Another recent work (by Vazquez <italic>et al.</italic>) already pointed to the significance of the solvent-capacity constraint in explaining the Warburg effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez1">[18]</xref>. Notably though, the work presented here provides a marked contribution over both studies: First, both employ abstract small-scale models. Specifically, the Vazquez <italic>et al.</italic> work introduces a schematic model of ATP production in central metabolism including just a handful of variables. Furthermore, similarly to the work of Pfeiffer <italic>et al.</italic>, their work does not explicitly account for the entire biomass composition and the associated energy requirements. In contrast, here we study a genome-scale biomass producing human model that, despite the scores of alternative biomass and energy production pathways existing in the human network, successfully shows that highly proliferating cells such as cancer cells are forced to display Warburg related phenotypes at high growth rates (phase III). Additionally, and in contrast to the small-scale models, our genome-scale model correctly predicts an experimentally observed transitional phase (II). Furthermore, on a mechanistic level, the genome-scale metabolic description provided by our analysis is significantly correlated with the gene expression patterns across the wide array of NCI-60 cancer cell-lines (much stronger than the association displayed by the stoichiometric model alone), a result which could not have been predicted by the Vazquez <italic>et al.</italic> model. Lastly, the model was able to predict the marked contribution of glutamine to rapid cellular growth. As a further demonstration of the robustness of our results, we repeated the analyses using a model accounting for maintenance ATP production, obtaining qualitatively similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>While the data on reactions' stoichiometry is considered accurate and comprehensive, enzyme kinetic constant data are noisy and are currently available for only about 15% of the reactions in the model. In the analysis presented here, we addressed this problem by assigning enzymes with missing turnover rates with the median rate computed over the set of known turnover rates. Notably, the model's main findings are robust to random sampling of turnover rates from a distribution of known rates, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref>. However, repeating the analysis when assigning all reactions in the model with the median turn-over rate shows no Warburg characteristics - testifying to the importance of utilizing known turnover rates even if this data is sparse. Future measurements of additional enzyme turnover rates and improved methods for accurately predicting these parameters (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Borger1">[35]</xref>) are expected to further refine the predictions of cancer metabolic phenotypes using stoichiometric metabolic models with an enzyme solvent capacity constraint.</p>
      <p>In our work we accounted for a solvent capacity constraint assuming a limited protein mass per cell, without considering the effect of enzymes' sub-cellular compartmentalization. To investigate how the latter would affect our predictions, we repeated the analysis while considering separate solvent capacity constraints for cytoplasm and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref>), yielding quantitatively similar results to those described above. The incorporation of solvent capacity constraints for different cellular compartments may lead to further improved prediction accuracy in the future, when additional data on enzyme turnover rates becomes available. Specifically, the addition of membrane-specific constraints may be a promising direction, as many metabolically important proteins are confined to membranes (e.g. those of respiratory chain and membrane biosynthesis).</p>
      <p>The presented modeling approach is likely to contribute to more accurate metabolic modeling of highly proliferating human cells in general (as was already shown regarding genome-scale models of microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Vazquez2">[21]</xref>) and of cancer cells. The latter may be in turn utilized for anti-cancer drug target prediction and specifically, for predicting drugs that work to reverse the Warburg effect. While the current analysis has relied on the available human generic model, future studies may utilize a similar methodology in modeling the metabolism of specific cancers. These may be generated by integrating cancer-signature expression data with the generic human model to carve out different cancer types models (using methods such as those outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Shlomi2">[27]</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Jerby1">[28]</xref>), and thus further advance the development of anti-cancer drugs specific to different cancers.</p>

Given a flux distribution vector <italic>v</italic>, for each reaction <italic>i</italic>, the enzyme concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> needed to maintain its flux <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (the i-th entry in <italic>v</italic>) was calculated as the product of<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>and the molecular weight of the enzyme catalyzing this reaction (denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), divided by its turnover number (denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), that is, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002018.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Total enzyme concentrations (per gene) were given by summing the enzyme concentrations across all of the reactions associated with the gene of interest (<italic>i.e.</italic> reactions catalyzed by enzymes encoded by this gene), based on a gene-to-reaction mapping given in the human metabolic model. The Spearman correlation between the gene expression vector and inferred enzyme concentration vector was calculated for the two models in each of the 60 cell lines. The robustness of the results was validated against 1,000 uniformly sampled flux distributions from the solution spaces of the two models using ACHR sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002018-Kaufman1">[46]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Modeling amino-acid uptakes</title>
        <p>Each of the 20 amino acids was added, in turn, to the growth media, resulting in 20 different maximal biomass production rates calculated based on (i) the stoichiometric model, and on (ii) a model additionally accounting for the solvent capacity constraint. The maximal amino-acid uptake rate was set to the same uptake rate as glucose; the results are shown to be robust to the choice of this value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002018.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>
