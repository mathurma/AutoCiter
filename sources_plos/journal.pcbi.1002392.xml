        <p>We observe and quantify wave-like characteristics of amoeboid migration. Using the amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, a model system for the study of chemotaxis, we demonstrate that cell shape changes in a wave-like manner. Cells have regions of high boundary curvature that propagate from the leading edge toward the back, usually along alternating sides of the cell. Curvature waves are easily seen in cells that do not adhere to a surface, such as cells that are electrostatically repelled from surfaces or cells that extend over the edge of micro-fabricated cliffs. Without surface contact, curvature waves travel from the leading edge to the back of a cell at ∼35 µm/min. Non-adherent myosin II null cells do not exhibit these curvature waves. At the leading edge of adherent cells, curvature waves are associated with protrusive activity. Like regions of high curvature, protrusive activity travels along the boundary in a wave-like manner. Upon contact with a surface, the protrusions stop moving relative to the surface, and the boundary shape thus reflects the history of protrusive motion. The wave-like character of protrusions provides a plausible mechanism for the zig-zagging of pseudopods and for the ability of cells both to swim in viscous fluids and to navigate complex three dimensional topography.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Migration of cells on surfaces and through tissues is an important part of life, from the amazingly coordinated migration of cells during development to the uncontrollable migration of metastatic cancer cells. Here we investigate the physics of cell migration with the goal of gaining new insights into how cells move and how they respond to obstacles. Through detailed quantitative analysis of time-dependent cell shapes, we demonstrate the existence of wave-like dynamic shape changes during the migration of <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. Specifically, we observe that in migrating cells local protrusions propagate from the front toward the back along roughly alternating sides of the cell. Near the leading edge, protrusions that have not yet adhered to the surface move faster than the cell migration speed. We also investigated cells that were not in contact with a surface and cells extended over cliff edges. Such cells exhibit similar protrusion dynamics at their leading edges but, since in this case the protrusions cannot adhere to a surface, the associated boundary curvature waves continue to travel along the sides of the cells. While our study shows wave-like dynamics under many different conditions, we do not directly measure whether waves involve transport of membrane or intracellular material.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During chemotaxis, a chemical gradient directs cell migration. Chemotaxis occurs in phenomena as diverse as wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Wagle1">[1]</xref> and embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Yang1">[2]</xref>, and has also been implicated in a wide array of pathological processes including aberrant angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-CapogrossoSansone1">[3]</xref> and cancer metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Kassis1">[4]</xref>. Chemotaxing cells can migrate individually during immune responses and neuronal patterning, or in cooperative groups during embryogenesis, wound healing, and organ and vasculature formation.</p>
      <p>The social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> is a model system for directed cell migration, and has been used to elucidate the regulatory processes of chemotaxis. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> chemotaxis is of comparable speed to neutrophil chemotaxis and involves similar regulatory processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Bagorda1">[5]</xref>. The chemotaxis of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is also more than an order of magnitude faster than typical epithelial cell migration and does not involve mature focal adhesion complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Friedl1">[6]</xref>. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells migrate directionally in gradients of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The binding of cAMP to specific cell surface receptors leads to the activation of various effectors, including adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the production and secretion of additional cAMP and the relay of the signal to neighboring cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Parent1">[7]</xref>. This signal relay guides the cells to migrate collectively in a head-to-tail fashion toward aggregation centers and to maintain a preferred migration direction over distances much larger than the characteristic diffusion lengths of molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-McCann1">[8]</xref>. Cells with the <italic>aca</italic><sup>−</sup> mutation do not produce cAMP and, in its absence, are mostly round and immotile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Kriebel1">[9]</xref>. However, when stimulated with exogenous cAMP, <italic>aca</italic><sup>−</sup> cells polarize and begin to migrate. If stimulated with a uniform concentration of cAMP, <italic>aca</italic><sup>−</sup> cells exhibit chemokinesis (chemically induced random migration). In response to a cAMP gradient, these cells chemotax effectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Kriebel1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The regulatory processes behind <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> chemotaxis have been investigated in great depth. Recent discoveries demonstrate the complexity of key chemotactic signaling pathways, including multiple compensatory mechanisms for sensing the direction of cAMP gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Rericha1">[10]</xref>. Models of cell movement often consider migration as the final step in this process and use the output of the directional sensing machinery to assign a probability of forming a protrusion (and subsequently migrating) in a particular direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Rickert1">[11]</xref>. In most models, the location at which a new protrusion forms determines the direction of the protrusion and ultimately the direction of migration of the cell. For example, Haastert and Bosgraaf found that pseudopods grow in a direction perpendicular to the local boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-VanHaastert1">[12]</xref>. Directional migration in response to chemotactic signals is considered to be due to either the formation of new protrusions (the compass model) or the biased bifurcation of existing protrusions (the bifurcation and bias model) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-King1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Quantitative studies of cell shape and motion that follow protrusions are now emerging, and indicate that protrusion dynamics are richer than anticipated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-VanHaastert1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Machacek1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Maeda1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Soll1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Bosgraaf1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Xiong1">[18]</xref>. Machacek and Danuser, tracking a fixed region of the boundary of slow epithelial cells with sub-pixel resolution, found three distinct states of local protrusion activity: local protrusions that grow and retract in a single location along the cell edge, waves that travel along the edge of the cell, and fast, large-scale protrusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Machacek1">[14]</xref>. Dobereiner <italic>et al.</italic> found that wave-like protrusion dynamics are common to a wide range of slow-moving cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Dbereiner1">[19]</xref>, especially during cell spreading.</p>
      <p>How are such complex protrusion dynamics relevant to chemotaxis and directed cell migration? For the models of chemotaxis reviewed above, and for fast migration, a local protrusion phenotype is usually assumed in which protrusions are a (noisy) output in response to a chemotactic signal. This view appears to be supported by experiments in which a strong chemotactic signal is placed in close proximity to individual cells, causing a pseudopod to form in the direction of the signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Parent1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, recent experiments and modeling efforts point to a more complex protrusive machinery. Indeed, given signal strengths at physiological levels (and even in the absence of chemotactic gradients), protrusions tend to form on alternating sides of the leading edge of the cell, resulting in a zig-zag migration pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Bosgraaf1">[17]</xref>. Such zig-zag motion indicates that protrusion locations are not just described by a noisy output based on a chemical signal, but are also influenced by the prior protrusion history. The alternating position of pseudopods can be explained, for example, by considering the protrusive machinery as an excitable system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Xiong2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The conclusion that alternating pseudopods are prominent in fast migrating cells relies on thresholds to separate individual pseudopods in a consistent way. However, it is unclear whether the underlying biology of protrusions justifies such thresholding. Instead, zig-zagging and alternating of pseudopods may be the result of wave-like behavior of the protrusive machinery. In developing tissues, actin waves can be seen to propagate across groups of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Blanchard1">[21]</xref>. There is also direct evidence that wave-like intracellular actin polymerization processes are prominent in fast migrating cells. Some of the first indications of this effect were from Vicker and colleagues, who found that <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> pseudopod dynamics are not random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Killich1">[22]</xref>, but rather are associated with actin filament polymerization waves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Vicker1">[23]</xref> that can drive locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Vicker2">[24]</xref>. Others were able to observe wave-like dynamics directly in actin polymerization and depolymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Gerisch1">[25]</xref>. The connection between internal waves and forces has also been elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Bretschneider1">[26]</xref>. Finally, the interaction between waves and surfaces is key to understanding migration: For example, Weiner found that when a neutrophil runs into another cell or an obstacle, actin waves are extinguished at the interaction site, allowing cells to change direction and avoid the obstacle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Weiner1">[27]</xref>. This observation indicates that waves may not be observed when cells are confined between boundaries, such as e.g. in a key paper that reported zig-zagging of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> protrusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Andrew1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To study the character of protrusions during fast cell migration and chemotaxis, we present new methods for the quantification of the dynamic shape of migrating cells. Using these methods, we demonstrate that protrusions in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> have a wave-like character. As found in neutrophils, the waves appear to stop moving when touching the surface, so the wave-like character of protrusions is most evident when cells do not touch the surface, or extend over the edge of a cliff. While our study highlights that wave-like dynamics exist under many different conditions, we do not directly measure motion of the actin cytoskeleton or membrane, and thus have no conclusive evidence whether the wave-like dynamics reflect reaction-diffusion waves (due to actin polymerization or myosin contraction dynamics) or transport of membrane or intracellular material. These results could lead to a model that relates protrusive waves to the zig-zag-like appearance of cell tracks and the directional persistence of cell motion during chemotaxis.</p>

        <title>Regions of high boundary curvature move from the front to the back of cells</title>
        <p>To study the changing shape of migrating <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells, we used a snake (also known as active contour) algorithm. We analyzed the shapes of starved, wild-type (WT) cells that were self-aggregating. The extracted shape of one such migrating cell is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g001"><italic>figure 1a</italic></xref>. The boundary color represents curvature, a measure of local shape. As expected, the front and back of the cell have high curvature. Additional peaks in boundary curvature indicate other local protrusions. We find that additional protrusions first become visible near the front of the cell and, with respect to the cell, propagate towards the back as the cell migrates. At the sides of cells, these curvature bumps appear stationary relative to the surface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g001"><italic>figure 1b</italic></xref> for a representative image sequence).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To study the motion and evolution of these propagating curvature peaks, we labeled the boundary in order to follow individual boundary points as they move. We defined a 1∶1 mapping between the boundary points in successive frames, choosing the mapping that minimized the total boundary point displacement. To create such a 1∶1 mapping, we described the boundary with the same number of points in every frame (400), even though the length of the perimeter of the cell varies from frame to frame.</p>
        <p>With the boundary points labeled in this way, we are able to visualize and analyze how local properties of the boundary, such as curvature, vary as a function of both space and time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g001"><italic>Figure 1c</italic></xref> is a kymograph that depicts how curvature evolves along the boundary as a function of time. The front and back of the cell each appear as thick stripes of high curvature and the additional, lateral peaks appear as thin lines that connect the front to the back. Since the thin lines representing the curvature peaks are approximately parallel, the curvature peaks travel at equal speed with respect to the cell. The boundary curvature kymograph of an additional, developed, WT cell is shown in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002392.s001">figure S1a</xref></italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002392.s009">video S3</xref></italic>). Averaging across 26 cells, we find that the peaks move relative to the cell at 10.9±0.7 µm/min, comparable to the average migration speed of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. This finding is consistent with the observation that peaks of high curvature on the side of the cell are stationary with respect to the surface.</p>
        <p>We have previously found that alternative tracking mappings yield similar results, but generally do not track the entire local boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Driscoll1">[29]</xref>. For instance, kymographs can be constructed with boundary points that are a constant distance from neighboring boundary points, by using the boundary point that is closest to 0° relative to the center of the cell to align the boundaries from frame to frame. Such a mapping shows similar curvature peak patterns, but these kymographs are more difficult to interpret since only part of the local boundary is tracked from frame to frame <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Driscoll1">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g001"><italic>Figure 1c</italic></xref> shows that most high curvature regions on the side of cells start at the leading edge, and thus that the shape of the cell reflects a history of activity at the leading edge. Indeed we find a connection between curvature and protrusions at the leading edge, as described below. The amplitude of each peak varies as it travels from front to back, but tends to diminish with time, a further indication that the associated local protrusions are passive or shrinking. The local protrusions appear on roughly alternating sides, resulting in a loose right-left-right-left pattern that may reflect the zig-zag pattern of pseudopod activity. The pattern is not without defects, as multiple protrusions can travel simultaneously along the same side of the cell.</p>

        <title>Cell-surface contact is enhanced near curvature peaks at the sides of cells</title>
        <p>Migration requires not only pseudopods but also adhesion to a surface. Thus, surface contact can indicate whether bumps on the side of the cell reflect pseudopods that have successfully adhered (and thus can contribute to motion) or unsuccessful pseudopods that failed to adhere. We imaged fluorescently-labeled, developed, WT cells, while simultaneously using internal reflection microscopy (IRM) to image the region of cell-surface contact. We extracted both the boundary of the entire cell and the boundary of the surface contact region(s) from the images. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g002"><italic>Figure 2a</italic></xref> shows, for a representative cell, an IRM image sequence overlaid with the boundary of the surface contact region and the boundary of the entire cell. In this image sequence, the cell extends a protrusion that is not in contact with the surface, the protrusion makes contact with the surface, and then the area of surface contact under the protrusion grows. Our data reveal that the local protrusions at the side of the cell correspond to regions of enhanced cell-surface contact, and thus likely reflect successful pseudopods. We note that some protrusions retract quickly and never contact the surface. For example, in the movie associated with this image sequence (<italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002392.s010">video S4</xref></italic>), 4 out of 14 large protrusions retract before they contact the surface.

        <p>Using surfaces with-three dimensional topography, we also analyzed the shapes of cells that adhere only at their back, even in standard salt concentrations. To guide a cell to move away from the surface, we placed a point source of cAMP above and over the edge of a microfabricated ramp that terminated with a 75 µm tall cliff, such that the surface closest to the point source was the cliff edge. A schematic of our set-up is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g003"><italic>figure 3a</italic></xref>. The majority of cells that reach the edge of the cliff extend themselves over the cliff edge. Many of those cells also migrate along the cliff edge to attempt to reach the needle. We never observed a cell falling off of a cliff. Instead, cells at the cliff edge extend up to 80% of their surface area over the edge toward the cAMP source. The shape dynamics at first glance look quite distinct – the cells swing back and forth quickly over the edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g003"><italic>figure 3b</italic></xref>).

        <p>Curvature peaks are suggestive of protrusions, because a localized protrusion is necessarily associated with a localized region of high curvature. To compare boundary curvature to motion, we developed a measure of local boundary motion. We calculated the motion of each boundary point by measuring the distance to the closest boundary point in a later frame and then smoothing over the list of mapped to boundary points. Protrusive motion was defined to be positive, while retractive motion was defined to be negative. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g005"><italic>Figure 5b</italic></xref> shows representative local motion mapping vectors colored by the value of the local motion measure, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g005"><italic>figure 5c</italic></xref> shows the local boundary motion kymograph of the same developed, WT cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g002"><italic>figure 2a</italic></xref>, (See <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002392.s001">figures S1b</xref></italic> and <italic>S2b</italic> for additional plots of WT and <italic>aca<sup>−</sup></italic> cells.)

We first analyze boundary motion under the assumption that protrusions and retractions are discrete events. The times and locations of individual protrusions and retractions along the boundary were defined as the peaks and valleys of the local motion measure, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g006"><italic>Figure 6b</italic></xref> shows the protrusions and retractions extracted from the local motion data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g006"><italic>figure 6a</italic></xref>.

        <p>While analyzing protrusions as discrete events yields results consistent with prior work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Bosgraaf1">[17]</xref>, two facets of the kymograph of local protrusions and retractions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g006"><italic>figure 6a</italic></xref> indicate that this discretization can mask continuous or wave-like characteristics of protrusive motion. First, protrusions are not well separated from each other. Second, many protrusions appear as tilted streaks in the kymograph, indicating that lateral motion occurs during the protrusion.</p>
        <p>To analyze protrusive and retractive motion as continuous boundary movement, we define the location of greatest protrusion and retraction activity for each frame as the location of the weighted average of the protrusive or retractive motion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g006"><italic>Figure 6c</italic></xref> shows a representative example of extracted mean protrusion and retraction locations.</p>
        <p>We measured the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the average protrusion location along the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g006"><italic>figures 6d</italic></xref> <italic>and S3</italic>). Note that this is not the MSD of centroid motion, but the MSD of protrusive motion along the boundary of the cell. We find that on short time scales, the protrusive motion along the boundary is nearly ballistic. As the time scale increases, protrusive motion becomes caged to the front of the cell. The transition between the time scales for ballistic and caged motion occurs at roughly 20 seconds, which corresponds to the average frequency of 2.9±0.2 protrusions/minute derived from discrete protrusions. Ballistic motion on short time scales suggests that peak protrusive activity travels along the boundary in a wave-like manner, similar to the peaks in boundary curvature. We estimate from the MSD at 8 seconds that the speed of these waves is at least 21 µm/min. This estimate is likely to be less than the true wave speed, since local motion (from which the mean protrusion is found) is measured across frames that are obtained 12 seconds apart, and since the displacement is not completely ballistic from 0 to 8 seconds.</p>
        <p>Together, these findings indicate that for adherent cells, protrusive activity is continuous and constantly shifts along the leading edge of the cell in a wave-like manner similar to the dynamics of the wave-like high curvature regions observed both in suspended cells and in cells extended over cliff edges.</p>

Some of these studies found that new protrusions often split off from existing protrusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Bosgraaf1">[17]</xref>, and recent data, which were analyzed by skeletonizing the cell, showed that protrusions can move toward the cell back <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Xiong1">[18]</xref>. Other studies found that the direction of the chemotactic signal affects the retractions of existing pseudopods, but not the pattern of generation of new pseudopods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Andrew1">[28]</xref>. Our results show that treating protrusive motion as a continuous process rather than as a series of discrete events provides more detailed information. Instead of trying to identify individual protrusions, which requires making potentially artificial distinctions among protrusions, we analyze protrusive motion quantitatively as a continuous process, which reveals its fundamentally wave-like character. On short time scales, the location of strongest protrusive activity is not stationary, but shifts along the leading edge of the cell at a speed of at least 21 µm/min for 20 seconds on average.</p>
          <p>Local protrusive motion at the cell front transitions from ballistic to caged at about 20 seconds. This 20 second characteristic time is consistent with the finding of Meili <italic>et al.</italic> that, on average, protrusions are extended for 22 seconds before they exert a force on the surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Meili1">[33]</xref>. Thus, our findings are consistent with waves of protrusive activity that stop moving when they contact the surface, as observed for neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Weiner1">[27]</xref>. However, although localized protrusions stop moving relative to the surface, they remain visible as high curvature regions. Curvature peaks then provide insights into the history of protrusive activity, and allow us to compare chemokinesis, chemotaxis, and the motion of non-adherent cells.</p>
          <p>Indeed, we find the same results both for self-aggregating WT cells and for chemokinesing <italic>aca<sup>−</sup></italic> cells. Chemokinesing cells also have ballistically-traveling curvature waves and zig-zagging protrusions (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002392.s002">figure S2</xref></italic>). A group of self-aggregating WT cells can be distinguished from a group of chemokinesing <italic>aca<sup>−</sup></italic> cells by their distinct long-term directionality. However, the kymographs of local curvature and local protrusions are not distinguishable. We also present evidence that similar wave processes govern the shape and shape dynamics of both adherent and non-adherent cells. In particular, the kymographs of local curvature are similar for both types of cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g001"><italic>figure 1</italic></xref> for adherent cells, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g002"><italic>figure 2</italic></xref> for non-adherent cells, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g003"><italic>figure 3</italic></xref> for cells at the edge of cliffs).</p>
          <p>The similarities in protrusive activity and shape dynamics of chemotaxing, chemokinesing, and suspended cells is hard to reconcile with models in which pseudopods are triggered directly by directional chemical signals. Our results are consistent with recent models that treat the cellular migratory apparatus as an excitable system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Xiong3">[34]</xref>, since wave-like and oscillatory dynamics are common in excitable systems.</p>

        <title>We hypothesize that wave-like protrusive activity may have three main consequences:</title>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>Wave-like protrusions provide a simple and robust mechanism for directed migration. Chemotactic signals are not needed to trigger migration, since protrusive activity is self-sustaining. This view is consistent with observations that cells continue to migrate for hours after a temporary migratory signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-McCann1">[8]</xref> without further stimulus and with speed and directional persistence comparable to those of chemotaxing cells. Chemotactic signals merely need to tune the excitability to steer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Xiong3">[34]</xref>.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Wave-like protrusions may allow cells to migrate in a viscous environment. Recent reports indicate that both <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and neutrophils can swim in fluids that are significantly more viscous than water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Barry1">[35]</xref>. Front extension and back retraction, one standard simplified view of amoeboid and neutrophil cell migration, cannot enable migration through a viscous fluid. The traveling protrusive waves observed here, on the other hand, break symmetry and so could explain the ability of cells to swim.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Wave-like protrusions may allow cells to search for surfaces in 3D environments. Away from a surface, a protrusion that advects backwards along the edge of the cell seems to lead to a wiggling motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002392-g003"><italic>figure 3</italic></xref>). This wiggling could in turn act as a search mechanism for surfaces for adhesion. Thus, zig-zag motion, the dominant mode of fast amoeboid migration on a flat surface, may be a side effect of a wave-like migration mechanism that is suitable for both migrating on surfaces and swimming.</p>

For cliff experiments, phase-contrast images were obtained with a 10× objective every 1.55 seconds. For footprint and polarization experiments, fluorescence, phase contrast and internal reflection microscopy (IRM) images were captured with a 40× objective every 2 or 4 seconds. For electrostatic repulsion experiments, fluorescence images were obtained on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope with a 100× objective every 2 seconds. For the remaining experiments, fluorescence images were obtained on the same confocal microscope with a 40× objective every 4 seconds.</p>

        <title>Tracking local boundary motion</title>
        <p>Image sequences that show the migration of individual cells were pre-processed using ImageJ to enhance contrast and to remove other cells. The shape of the cell was then extracted using a snake algorithm. We adapted sample code <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002392-Xu1">[37]</xref> to follow the shape of a cell automatically throughout an image sequence and to parametrize the shape with 400 boundary points. Note that while within each frame neighboring points are equidistant along the perimeter, the distance between neighboring points varies across frames as the length of the cell perimeter changes.</p>
        <p>With a constant number of boundary points per frame, <italic>all</italic> local boundary points can be tracked simultaneously by defining a 1∶1 mapping between the points in each frame and the successive frame. We chose the mapping that maintained the numbering sequence of boundary points, and that minimized the sum of the square distances points moved from frame to frame. An example of such a tracking mapping is shown in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002392.s016">video S10</xref></italic>.

        <title>Calculating boundary point associated measures</title>
        <p>At each boundary point, we calculate the boundary curvature by fitting a circle to that boundary point and the two points that are 10 boundary points away from it. The magnitude of the boundary curvature is then defined as the reciprocal of the radius of that circle. If the midpoint of the two points 10 boundary points away is inside the cell, the curvature is defined as positive, otherwise it is defined as negative. For visualization, the curvature is smoothed over 3 boundary points and 3 frames, and the color scale is cut off at a maximum curvature magnitude.</p>
        <p>To calculate local motion, we first mapped each boundary point to the closest boundary point in the frame 12 seconds later. This time interval was chosen so that boundary motion dominates over image noise. Next, we used an averaging window to smooth the mapping twice. (The first smoothing had a window size of 19 boundary points, while the second had a size of 15 boundary points.) <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002392.s005">Figures S5a</xref></italic> and <italic>b</italic> show an example of the mapping before and after smoothing.
