<p>We present molecular dynamics simulations of unliganded human hemoglobin (Hb) A under physiological conditions, starting from the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> state. The simulations were carried out with protonated and deprotonated HC3 histidines His(β)146, and they sum up to a total length of 5.6µs. We observe spontaneous and reproducible <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> quaternary transitions of the Hb tetramer and tertiary transitions of the α and β subunits, as detected from principal component projections, from an RMSD measure, and from rigid body rotation analysis. The simulations reveal a marked asymmetry between the α and β subunits. Using the mutual information as correlation measure, we find that the β subunits are substantially more strongly linked to the quaternary transition than the α subunits. In addition, the tertiary populations of the α and β subunits differ substantially, with the β subunits showing a tendency towards <bold>R</bold>, and the α subunits showing a tendency towards <bold>T</bold>. Based on the simulation results, we present a transition pathway for coupled quaternary and tertiary transitions between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> conformations of Hb.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>As the prototypic allosteric protein, human hemoglobin (Hb) has drawn extensive scientific efforts for many decades. Human Hb exists in two quaternary conformations, the low-affinity (or deoxy) <bold>T</bold> state, and the high-affinity (or oxy) <bold>R</bold> state, and the transition between the <bold>T</bold> and the <bold>R</bold> state is mainly characterized by a 15° rotation of the α1β1 dimer with respect to the α1β2 dimer. Subsequent binding of molecular oxygen to the four heme groups drives the Hb tetramer from the deoxy <bold>T</bold> to the oxy <bold>R</bold> state, rendering the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions the molecular process that underlies the well-known cooperativity of ligand binding. Despite the wealth of structural information available for Hb, the mechanistic coupling between the quaternary transition and the tertiary transitions in the individual subunits remains poorly understood. We report spontaneous and reproducible <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold> transitions of Hb in molecular dynamics simulations, allowing us to study the mechanism underlying the transitions in atomistic detail. We pay special attention to the interplay between the tertiary and quaternary transitions of Hb, as well as to the tertiary <bold>t</bold>/<bold>r</bold> populations of the subunits in a particular (<bold>T</bold> or <bold>R</bold>) quaternary state. Interestingly, we observe a pronounced asymmetry between the α and β subunits with the β subunits being more strongly linked to the quaternary transitions than the α subunits. The simulations allow us to propose a pathway for coupled quaternary and tertiary transitions between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> conformations of Hb.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Conformational transitions of allosteric proteins are fundamental to a variety of biological functions. For instance, quaternary transitions in hemoglobin (Hb) give rise to the cooperativity of ligand binding and have therefore drawn extensive and ongoing scientific interest over many decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Perutz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Eaton1">[2]</xref>. The end points of the quaternary transition of Hb are referred to as deoxy <bold>T</bold> state and oxy <bold>R</bold> state of Hb, which are characterized by low and high oxygen affinity, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Perutz2">[3]</xref>, and the cooperativity of ligand binding originates from the dependence of quaternary population on the number of liganded subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Monod1">[4]</xref>. The oxygen affinity of Hb decreases with lower pH, a phenomenon that is referred to as alkaline Bohr effect. Approximately 40% of the Bohr effect has been attributed to the protonation of the terminal His146 residues of the β subunits, which are also denoted as ‘HC3 histidines’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Shih1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The stereochemical explanation of Hb cooperativity and the characterization of the transition pathway were originally based on the HbCO and deoxyHb crystal structures, corresponding to the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> state, respectively. According to these structures, the transition can mainly be described by a 12–15° rotation of the α1β1 dimer with respect to the α1β2 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Perutz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Baldwin1">[6]</xref>. Later, a second quaternary structure of liganded Hb, termed <bold>R2</bold>, was found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Silva1">[7]</xref>, with a 1.1Å larger distance between the centers of mass (COMs) of two β subunits as compared to the <bold>R</bold> structure. Differences between <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R2</bold> at the α1–β2 interface triggered a still unresolved discussion whether <bold>R2</bold> is a stable intermediate on a <bold>R</bold>-<bold>R2</bold>-<bold>T</bold> pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Silva1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Xu1">[9]</xref>. NMR experiments indicate that liganded Hb in solution is in equilibrium between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R2</bold> structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Lukin1">[10]</xref>. More recently, two additional liganded Hb structures <bold>RR2</bold> and <bold>R3</bold> were found using the high-salt crystallization conditions of Perutz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Safo1">[11]</xref>, emphasizing that a consensus view on the liganded Hb state in solution is far from being reached. <bold>RR2</bold> represents an intermediate structure between <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R2</bold>, whereas the distance between the COMs of the two β subunits is reduced by 3.1Å in <bold>R3</bold> as compared to the <bold>R</bold> structure.</p>

<p>(A) X-ray structures of Hb in the <bold>R</bold> state (green) and in the <bold>T</bold> state (red). The <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold> quaternary transition is mainly characterized by a rotation of the α1/β1 dimer (colored) with respect to the α2/β2 dimer (gray). To visualize the rotation, the α2/β2 dimers of the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> structure were superimposed on each other. (B) A typical dodecahedral simulation box of Hb. The Hb tetramer is shown in cartoon representation, sodium and chloride ions as red and blue spheres, respectively, and water is depicted as transparent sticks.

<p>Extensive efforts aimed to identify the transition pathway of Hb in response to ligand dissociation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Shulman1">[12]</xref>. The kinetics of the <bold>R</bold>→<bold>T</bold> transition after photodissociation of the CO adduct, HbCO, have been studied using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques including absorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Hofrichter1">[13]</xref>, Raman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Jayaraman1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Balakrishnan1">[15]</xref>, and circular dichroism spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Goldbeck1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Bjorling1">[17]</xref>. The picture derived from these experiments suggests a multistep <bold>R</bold>→<bold>T</bold> pathway via several metastable intermediates, with relaxation rates ranging from tens of nanoseconds to tens of microseconds, and with a time constant of ∼21µs for the overall <bold>R</bold>→<bold>T</bold> quaternary transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Balakrishnan1">[15]</xref>. The experiments provide extremely valuable insights into the kinetics of Hb, but they also bear limitations. They do not directly detect the global quaternary transitions, but mainly measure the formation of hydrogen bonds of aromatic residues, such as the Trp(β)37-Asp(α)94 and the Tyr(α)42-Asp(β)99 H-bonds, which must be interpreted in terms of conformational transitions. A full-atomistic picture of the <bold>R</bold>→<bold>T</bold> transition could so far exclusively be derived for a mollusk dimeric hemoglobin using time-resolved X-ray crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Knapp1">[18]</xref>. Such experiments provide an ensemble-averaged picture, whereas Hb may follow heterogeneous transition pathways that may not be fully reflected by the spectra. Furthermore, in contrast to the well-studied <bold>R</bold>→<bold>T</bold> transition, little is known about the kinetics of the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition because that transition cannot be triggered by photolysis.</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide a full-atomistic picture of Hb and are therefore well suited to complement experimental efforts. Early MD efforts focused on the photodissociation of CO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Henry1">[19]</xref>, or were restricted to the dynamic treatment of a subset of Hb residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Gao1">[20]</xref>. Ramadas and Rifkind considered the response of Hb to the perturbation of the heme on a several 100ps time scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Ramadas1">[21]</xref>, and Mouawad and coworkers enforced quaternary transitions within 200ps using a technique called path exploration method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Mouawad1">[22]</xref>. In addition, a set of MD simulation of up to 6ns were carried out with a focus on the mechanism of effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Laberge1">[23]</xref>. Recently, a single 45-ns simulation of Hb was published without observing any conformational transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Saito1">[24]</xref>. Complementary to the MD studies, a normal mode analysis considered the collective motions intrinsic to the Hb tetramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Mouawad2">[25]</xref>, and an elastic network study suggested a <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R2</bold> transition as the preferential quaternary transition pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Xu1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>So far, no spontaneous quaternary or tertiary transitions of Hb were observed during MD simulations, presumably since previous simulations were restricted to too short time scales. Here, we apply extensive MD simulations to investigate the deoxy <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> state of human. We observe for the first time spontaneous and reproducible quaternary transitions of Hb, as well as tertiary transitions of the α and β subunits. Hence, these simulations allow one to study the transition mechanism in atomistic detail. We find the <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold> (in contrast to the <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R2</bold>) pathway as the primary quaternary transition pathway. By analyzing repeated <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold> transitions, we find a marked asymmetry between the α and β subunits. Based on the simulation results, we present a schematic mechanism underlying the preferential transition pathway between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> states of hemoglobin.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>For the present study, Hb was simulated using five different initial configurations. (1) Starting from the <bold>R</bold>-state with His(β)146 protonated (HC3 protonation), (2), from the <bold>R</bold>-state with His(β)146 deprotonated, (3) from the <bold>T</bold>-state with His(β)146 protonated (HC3 protonation), and (4) from the <bold>T</bold>-state with His(β)146 deprotonated, and (5) starting from the <bold>R2</bold> state with deprotonated His(β)146. All simulations are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000774-t001">Table 1</xref>. In a first step, we aimed to assess whether Hb displays spontaneous quaternary transitions within the simulated times scales of several hundred nanoseconds. To this end, each of the configurations 1–3 was simulated three times for 200ns starting with different initial velocities, and configuration 4 was simulated six times for 300ns. Simulations starting from <bold>R2</bold> were carried out three times for 130ns. Together with 20 additional 50ns simulations starting from <bold>T</bold> and simulations with restrained salt bridges (see below), the simulation times sum up to a total of ∼5.6 µs of Hb simulation, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than simulations in previously reported MD studies of Hb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Ramadas1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Saito1">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>Simulations starting from R or R2</title>
<p>The simulations starting from the <bold>R</bold> or <bold>R2</bold> were carried out without carbon monoxide (CO). Removal of CO from the structures is expected to shift the equilibrium between the <bold>T</bold> and <bold>R</bold> states towards the deoxy <bold>T</bold> state, corresponding to a CO photodissociation experiment. To quantify the state of Hb with respect to the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> state, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the X-ray structures of the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Silva1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Park1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Fermi1">[27]</xref>. The PCA was carried out using the C-α and the heme group atoms. The resulting two X-ray eigenvectors span the <bold>R</bold>-<bold>R2</bold>-<bold>T</bold> subspace and hence, projections onto these two eigenvectors can visualize transitions between the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> states. The linear motions along the two eigenvectors are also visualized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s009">video S1</xref>. The first eigenvector is mainly characterized by a large-scale rotation of the α1β1 relative to the α2β2 dimer as required for the <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold> quaternary transition, whereas the second eigenvector accounts for the distance between the two β subunits.</p>
<p>In all simulations starting from the <bold>R</bold> state with HC3 protonation (denoted R.HC3-1 to R.HC3-3), starting from the <bold>R</bold> state without HC3 protonation (denoted R.noHC3-1 to R.noHC3-3) or from the <bold>R2</bold> state (denoted R2-1-R2-3), no quaternary transitions to the <bold>T</bold> state occurred during 200ns or 130ns of simulation, respectively. The PCA plots of the simulations R.HC3-1 to R.HC3-3 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g002">Fig. 2A–C</xref>. The <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> as well as the more recently resolved <bold>RR2</bold> and <bold>R3</bold> structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Safo1">[11]</xref> are indicated by black dots, and the simulation structures by colored dots. All three simulations R.HC3-1 to R.HC3-3 remain in the proximity of the <bold>R</bold> state, but clearly deviate from the <bold>R</bold> X-ray structure. Noteworthy, R.HC3-1 and R.HC3-3 sample the region between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R2</bold> structure, that is the conformational space near the <bold>RR2</bold> X-ray structure (PDB code 1MKO), showing that transitions between conformations around the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>RR2</bold> structures can occur on a 100ns time scale.

<p>The inability of the simulations to reach the <bold>T</bold> state in the simulated time is also visible from the root mean square deviation (RMSD) plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>. The RMSD has been computed by first superimposing the α1β1 dimer onto the α1β1 dimer of the <bold>T</bold> X-ray structure. Subsequently, the backbone RMSD of the α2β2 dimer with respect to the α2β2 dimer of the <bold>R</bold> X-ray structure was computed, providing a measure which is particularly sensitive to the rotation of the two dimers with respect to each other and hence, to the <bold>R</bold>→<bold>T</bold> quaternary transition. This RMSD measure has been applied previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Silva1">[7]</xref>, and it is henceforth referred to as ‘rotRMSD’. Note that the rotRMSD yields larger values than the standard RMSD measure that is typically computed after superimposing the complete structure onto the reference. For instance, the backbone rotRMSD between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> X-ray structures equals 0.53nm, whereas the standard backbone RMSD is 0.24nm. As visible from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, none of the three simulations approaches the <bold>T</bold> state, with the rotRMSD being larger than the rotRMSD between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> X-ray structures. The corresponding plots for the three simulations starting from <bold>R</bold> without HC3 protonation (R.noHC3-1 to R.noHC3-3) as well as for the three simulations starting from <bold>R2</bold> (denoted R2-1 to R2-3) are shown in supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s002">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s003">S2</xref>, respectively. No spontaneous quaternary transitions to the <bold>T</bold> state occurred during these simulations. Simulation R2-3 temporarily samples conformations near the <bold>RR2</bold> structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s003">Fig. S2C</xref>), but no full transitions between <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R2</bold> were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s002">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s003">S2</xref>). Taken together, the simulations starting from <bold>R</bold> or <bold>R2</bold> remain in the conformational space around the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>RR2</bold>, and <bold>R2</bold> structures within hundreds of nanoseconds. On the same time scale, simulations starting from <bold>R</bold> or <bold>R2</bold> occasionally sample conformations around the <bold>RR2</bold> structure as measured from the eigenvector projections, suggesting that <bold>R</bold>, <bold>RR2</bold>, and <bold>R2</bold> can be interpreted as representatives of a larger R-like ensemble.</p>

<title>T→R transitions</title>
<p>In contrast to the rather stable simulations starting from <bold>R</bold> or <bold>R2</bold>, the simulations starting from the <bold>T</bold> state show a remarkable and reproducible tendency towards the <bold>R</bold> state. In the following, the three simulations starting from <bold>T</bold> with protonated His(β)146 are denoted as T.HC3-1 to T.HC3-3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g003">Figures 3A–C</xref> show the projections of T.HC3-1 to T.HC3-3 onto the two X-ray eigenvectors. The <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> are indicated by black dots and the simulation structures as colored point clouds. The color indicates the rotRMSD of each simulation structure with respect to the <bold>R</bold> state and has again been measured by first superimposing the α1β1 dimer and subsequently computing the RMSD from the α2β2 dimer only. The rotRMSD during the simulations T.HC3-1 to T.HC3-3 is also plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>. During all three simulations, Hb closely approaches the <bold>R</bold> state, as either measured from the PCA vector projections or from the rotRMSD. Note that the rotRMSD to <bold>R</bold> stabilizes at values ≤0.4nm, close to the rotRMSD of the simulations which started from <bold>R</bold> and which remained in the proximity of <bold>R</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s002">Fig. S1A–C and S1E</xref>). Hence, simulations T.HC3-1 to T.HC3-3 describe complete spontaneous quaternary transitions from <bold>T</bold> to <bold>R</bold>. The simulation time required for the quaternary transition substantially differs between the three simulations. Whereas T.HC3-1 and T.HC3-2 require 100–150ns, T.HC3-3 approaches <bold>R</bold> up to a rotRMSD of 0.35nm within only 2ns, although additional 20ns are required before Hb is stabilized in the proximity of <bold>R</bold>. To our knowledge, T.HC3-1 to T.HC3-3 are the first reported simulations of full spontaneous quaternary transitions of Hb. Noteworthy, during none of the simulations starting from <bold>T</bold>, Hb approached the <bold>R2</bold> structure, rendering any role of <bold>R2</bold> as an intermediate between <bold>T</bold> and <bold>R</bold> unlikely, in agreement to previous geometrical considerations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Srinivasan1">[8]</xref>.

<p>The HC3 histidines have been shown to contribute ∼40% to the alkaline Bohr-effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Shih1">[5]</xref> and hence, the deprotonation of HC3 is expected to (further) destabilize the <bold>T</bold> state and drive Hb towards the <bold>R</bold> state. To assess whether this effect can be observed in the simulations, we have carried out six 300-ns simulations starting from the <bold>T</bold> state, this time with the His(β)146 being deprotonated (referred to as T.noHC3-1 to T.noHC3-6). The projections of the structures from T.noHC3-1 to T.noHC3-6 onto the X-ray eigenvectors are plotted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s004">Fig. S3A</xref>–C/E-G. Likewise to simulations with double-protonated His(β)146, some of the T.noHC3 simulations carried out full or partial quaternary transitions from <bold>T</bold> to <bold>R</bold>, as visible from the eigenvector projections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s004">Fig. S3A</xref>/F/G) as well as from the rotRMSD to <bold>R</bold> (e.g., black curve in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s004">Fig. S3D</xref>). In contrast, T.noHC3-2 and T.noHC3-3 were not able to carry out the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition within simulation time, although they also showed a tendency towards <bold>R</bold> at the beginning of the simulations. Visual inspection of the trajectories show that the lack of a positive charge at the His(β)146 indeed accounts for this result. If His(β)146 are deprotonated, the lack of salt bridges renders His(β)146 more flexible as compared to the protonated His(β)146 in the T.HC3 simulations. As a result, the His(β)146 frequently entered the junction between the two β subunits (as present in the <bold>R</bold> X-ray structure), but one (or both) of the two His(β)146 alternatively formed hydrogen bonds to the nearby α subunit, blocking the transition towards the <bold>R</bold>-state for the remaining several hundred nanoseconds of the simulations. In contrast, the protonated histidines (simulations T.HC3-1 to T.HC3-3) were found to be structurally stable near the His(β)146 position of the <bold>T</bold> X-ray structure, tightly bound to Asp94 and Glu90 by subunit-internal salt bridges. Therefore, these histidines do not interact with the nearby α subunit, allowing the two β subunits to rapidly approach each other as required for the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition. Hence, deprotonation of His(β)146 results in opposing consequences. On the one hand, it allows the two His(β)146 to enter the junction with the imidazole rings pointing towards each other, as present in the <bold>R</bold> X-ray structure. On the other hand, uncharged His(β)146 are flexible and thus form metastable configurations which inhibit the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> quaternary transition for at least hundreds of nanoseconds.</p>

<title>Rigid-body rotations during T→R transitions</title>
<p>Complementary to the PCA projections and the rotRMSD measure, we have analyzed the quaternary <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition in terms of rigid-body rotations of the α2β2 dimer with respect to the α1β1 dimer. Accordingly, we quantified the rotation of the dimeric α2β2 axis that connects the center of mass (COM) of the α2 subunit with the COM of the β2 subunit (colored rods in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g004">Fig. 4A/B</xref>). In line with the rotRMSD calculation, the rotation of the α2β2 axis was measured by first superimposing the α1β1 dimer onto the α1β1 dimer of the <bold>T</bold> X-ray structure. Subsequently, the angle between the α2β2 axis and the α2β2 axis of the <bold>T</bold> X-ray structure was calculated.</p>

The blue, violet, and orange rods show the α2β2 axis of snapshots from simulations that (partially) carried out the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition. Snapshots represented by the blue and violet rods were taken from simulations T.HC3-2 and T.HC3-2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g003">Fig. 3B/C</xref>), and the orange rod from one of the 20 additional 50ns-simulations starting from <bold>T</bold> (with deprotonated HC3 histidines) that closely approached the <bold>R</bold> structure (corresponding to the black curve in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s005">Fig. S4</xref>). For comparison, the α2β2 axes of the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>R3</bold> structures are shown as light green, dark green, and lime green rods, respectively. In line with the PCA projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), the α2β2 dimer displays a rotation from the <bold>T</bold> orientation to the <bold>R</bold> orientation during theses simulations. In addition, the COMs of the α2 and β2 subunits (spheres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g004">Fig. 4A/B</xref>) approach the respective COMs in the <bold>R</bold> structure or, alternatively, take an intermediate position between COMs in the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R3</bold> structures (violet rod). In none of these simulations, the α2β2 axis approaches the respective position in the <bold>R2</bold> structure (dark green). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g004">Figure 4C</xref> plots the α2β2 rotation angle versus time during simulations T.HC3-2/3, confirming the rotational <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition.</p>
<p>The arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g004">Fig. 4A/B</xref> indicate the rotation axes that map the <bold>T</bold> α2β2 axis onto the α2β2 axes in the simulation snapshots or onto the axes in the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>R3</bold> structures. According to these arrows, the rotation axis during the T.noHC3 simulation (orange arrow) resembles the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> rotation axis, whereas the rotation axes in simulations T.HC3-2/3 resemble the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R3</bold> rotation axis. Hence, the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition is not restricted to a single rotation axis, suggesting that the quaternary transition can instead occur via different rotational (and translational) degrees of freedom.</p>

<title>Interplay between quaternary and tertiary conformational transitions</title>
<p>The simulations displaying full <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions allowed us to probe the interplay between quaternary and tertiary transitions. A reaction coordinate for the quaternary transition is given by the projection onto the difference vector connecting the <bold>T</bold> and <bold>R</bold> X-ray structures. Similarly, projections onto the difference vectors representing the tertiary <bold>t</bold>-<bold>r</bold> transitions of the α and β subunits were used as reaction coordinates for the tertiary conformational transitions. Here, the lower-case letters <bold>r</bold> and <bold>t</bold> denote the subunit conformations in the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>T</bold> X-ray structures, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s008">Fig. S7</xref>, the projection onto the quaternary transition vector is strongly correlated to the dimer rotational angle during <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions, suggesting that the projection on the quaternary transition vector can be interpreted as the dimeric rigid-body rotation analyzed in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Figure 5</xref> displays the projections of simulation T.HC3-3 on the tertiary versus the quaternary <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold> transition vectors. The projections are normalized such that the <bold>T</bold>/<bold>t</bold> state (quaternary/tertiary) corresponds to a projection of +1, whereas the <bold>R</bold>/<bold>r</bold> state corresponds to a projection of −1. Before the normalization applied for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, tertiary projections of ±1 correspond to projections of ±0.76nm and ±0.92nm for the α and β subunits, respectively. Thus, the β subunits undergo a larger internal rearrangement during <bold>t</bold>-<bold>r</bold> transitions as compared to the α subunits. The color-coding represents simulation time. Interestingly, the tertiary transitions of the β subunits are correlated to the quaternary transition in that simulation. The tertiary transition of β1 occurs simultaneously to the quaternary transition during the first 20ns (blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), and the final step in the quaternary transition between ∼100ns and ∼200ns occurs simultaneously to the final step in the transition of β2 (yellow and red clouds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, no such correlation can be observed between the quaternary transition and the transition of the α subunits.</p>

<p>To assess if the observed correlation between subunits and the Hb quaternary structure is a robust feature of <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions, we have carried out 20 additional 50-ns simulations of Hb starting from the <bold>T</bold> state with deprotonated His(β)146. In six of the 20 simulations, Hb carried out a full transition to the <bold>R</bold> state, as detected from a rotRMSD of &lt;0.3nm to the <bold>R</bold> X-ray structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s005">Fig. S4</xref>). We applied the so-called mutual information (MI) to measure the correlation between the quaternary and tertiary transitions during these six <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions. MI is a quantity from information theory measuring correlation between two arbitrary variables. MI does not only detect linear correlation, but quantifies any kind of interdependence including non-linear and higher-order correlation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g006">Figure 6A</xref> depicts the MI between quaternary and tertiary transitions, as averaged from the six transitions observed in the 50-ns simulations. In line with simulation T.HC3-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), the quaternary transition is substantially stronger correlated to the tertiary transitions of the β subunits than to the tertiary transitions of the α subunits.</p>

Clearly, the correlation between any pair of the subunits is significantly weaker than the correlation between the β subunits and the quaternary transition (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Only the two β subunits are to some extent correlated to each other. That correlation may, however, arise indirectly via the correlation of each of the β subunits to the quaternary transition. Taken together, the tertiary transition of the β subunits occur simultaneously to the quaternary <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition, whereas the transitions of the α subunits can occur on longer time scales after completion of the quaternary transition.</p>

<title>Tertiary populations in a given quaternary state</title>
<p>Before the identification of functionally different tertiary states in the <bold>T</bold> quaternary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Rivetti1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Bruno1">[29]</xref>, allosteric models for Hb did not explicitly consider the population of different tertiary states of Hb subunits within a given quaternary state. Instead, the cooperative effects in Hb were attributed to the dependence of subunit oxygen affinity on the quaternary state of Hb, whereas at the same time, the population of the quaternary states depends on the number of liganded subunits (Eaton et al, 2007). These models include the quaternary two-state model by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (MWC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Monod1">[4]</xref>), the Cooperon model by Brunori and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Gill1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Brunori1">[31]</xref>, as well as the model by Szabo and Karplus, which was later generalized by Lee and Karplus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Szabo1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Lee1">[33]</xref>.

<p>Although the populations are presumably not fully converged within the simulation timescales, a number of significant conclusions can be drawn from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g006">Fig. 6</xref>. (i) Within a given quaternary state (<bold>R</bold> or <bold>T</bold>), the α and β subunits populate a continuous ensemble of substates, including both the <bold>r</bold> and <bold>t</bold> tertiary states known from the X-ray structures, in line with the idea of the TTS model that different tertiary states populate a given quaternary state. However, the α and β subunit ensembles are not constricted to the region between the respective tertiary X-ray structures (at projections of −1 and +1), but the subunits in addition show a high probability to populate states “beyond” the X-ray structures, at values below −1 and above +1 (ii) The distributions of the α and β subunits are not equivalent. The β subunits (grey curves) display a strong tendency towards the <bold>r</bold> structure, even for the Hb tetramer in the <bold>T</bold> quaternary state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g007">Fig. 7B/D</xref>). In contrast, the α subunits (black curves) tend towards the <bold>t</bold> structure, even for the tetramer in the <bold>R</bold> quaternary state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g007">Fig. 7A/C</xref>). (iii) As expected, generally the tertiary subunit distributions in the <bold>R</bold> quaternary state are shifted towards the <bold>r</bold> tertiary state, and the subunit distributions in the <bold>T</bold> quaternary state are shifted towards the <bold>t</bold> tertiary state (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g007">Fig. 7A to B and C to D</xref>). (iv) A comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g007">Fig. 7 A/C to C/D</xref> shows that the protonation of His(β)146 shifts the populations of the β subunits from the <bold>r</bold> towards the <bold>t</bold> state (to the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), whereas the α subunits are relatively unaffected by the protonation. This finding is to some extend expected because the His(β)146 are located at the β1/β2 interface, mainly affecting the β subunits. Note that the shift in the β population towards <bold>t</bold> is also in accordance with the alkaline Bohr effect, that is with the tendency towards the low-affinity <bold>T</bold> state in a more acidic environment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have reported reproducible spontaneous quaternary transitions of human Hb A from the <bold>T</bold> to the <bold>R</bold> state in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, as well as tertiary transitions of the Hb subunits. The simulations draw a highly diverse picture of the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions. The <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition occurs on different time scales, depending on the pathway of the transitions and on the stability of metastable conformations formed during the transitions. For example, the conformation characterized by hydrogen bonds between His(β)146 and the nearby α subunit was frequently formed in simulations starting from the <bold>T</bold> state with deprotonated His(β)146, slowing down the transition by at least hundreds of nanoseconds. Noteworthy, the simulations starting from the <bold>T</bold> X-ray structure frequently approached the <bold>R</bold> but never the <bold>R2</bold> X-ray structure, in contrast to a previous elastic network study that reported a tendency of <bold>T</bold> towards the <bold>R2</bold> state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Xu1">[9]</xref>. Simulations starting from <bold>R</bold> or <bold>R2</bold> did not approach <bold>T</bold> during simulation time, as expected from spectroscopic measurements that suggest a 21µs relaxation time for the full <bold>R</bold>→<bold>T</bold> transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Balakrishnan1">[15]</xref>. Instead, transitions between <bold>R</bold> and <bold>RR2</bold> or <bold>R2</bold> and <bold>RR2</bold> occurred on a 100ns timescale, suggesting that these structures can be interpreted as three representatives of a continuous R-like ensemble, in accordance with previous NMR studies that suggested a dynamic equilibrium between the <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R2</bold> X-ray structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Lukin1">[10]</xref>. Our simulations would also be line with a <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold>-<bold>R2</bold> allosteric pathway as suggested from geometrical considerations and crystallographic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Srinivasan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Schumacher1">[35]</xref>. Noteworthy, the trajectories of Hb starting from the same structure (<bold>T</bold>, <bold>R</bold>, or <bold>R2</bold>) typically diverge, sampling different parts of the phase space even on the hundreds of nanoseconds time scale. This finding emphasizes (i) the diversity of conformations accessible to Hb, and (ii), that single MD trajectories must be interpreted with care because they may not represent the complex behavior of Hb.</p>
<p>A surprising result of our simulations is the instability of the <bold>T</bold> state and its remarkable tendency towards <bold>R</bold>. Because we have simulated unliganded Hb, we had expected Hb to be stable in its deoxy <bold>T</bold> state, in particular with protonated His(β)146. A possible artifact from the applied force field seems unlikely, because data from previous computational studies using different force fields also suggest a relatively instable <bold>T</bold> state. Mouawad and Perahia observed a low-barrier quaternary pathway from <bold>T</bold> towards a quaternary <bold>R</bold>-like state derived from a combination of normal mode analysis and energy minimization using the QUANTA, CHARMm21, and CHARMM22 force fields. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Mouawad2">[25]</xref>. A 6-ns simulation of Hb starting from <bold>T</bold> (using the CHARMM force field) reported by Laberge and Yonetani displayed a rapidly increasing backbone RMSD up to 4Å <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Laberge1">[23]</xref>. In addition, Saito and Okazaki published a single 45-ns trajectory starting from an oxy T-state (pdb 1GZX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Paoli1">[36]</xref>) using the AMBER96 force field. In that simulation, the distance between the α1β1 dimer and the α2β2 dimer increased by 2 Å within only 15ns. That displacement may, however, also originate from the oxygenated heme groups present in the 1GZX structure.</p>
<p>To further investigate the instability of the <bold>T</bold> state, we have carried out three additional 200-ns simulations of Hb starting from <bold>T</bold> with protonated His(β)146 (termed T.SBres-1 to T.SBres-3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s006">Fig. S5</xref>). During the first 100ns of these simulations, all salt bridges which are present in <bold>T</bold> but broken in the <bold>R</bold> state were restrained by applying a harmonic potential between the respective salt bridge partners (see experimental procedures for details). After 100ns, the salt bridge restraints were removed and each of the three systems was simulated for additional 100ns. Two putative sources of artifacts were addressed with these simulations: (i) could present-day force fields underestimate the stability of the salt bridges, leading to an unstable <bold>T</bold> state? And (ii) could non-equilibrium effects, such as a non-equilibrated electrolyte distribution, destabilize <bold>T</bold>? Both sources of artifacts could be excluded from simulations T.SBres-1-3. (i) Although full <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions cannot occur during the first 100ns of these simulations, they showed the same reproducible tendency of <bold>T</bold> towards <bold>R</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s006">Fig. S5A</xref>–C, green dots), suggesting that a putative lack of salt bridge stability does not induce the tendency of <bold>T</bold> towards <bold>R</bold>. (ii) After 100ns of simulation with restrained salt bridges, the systems represent well-equilibrated T-like structures. However, after releasing the salt bridges, these simulations carried out transitions towards <bold>R</bold> as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s006">Fig. S5A</xref>–C, magenta dots), and T.SBres-3 even approaches the <bold>R</bold> X-ray structure as measured from a rotRMSD &lt;0.4nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s006">Fig. S5D</xref>). Hence, limited equilibration can be excluded as a reason for <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions. Taken together, our simulations together with previous computational studies suggest that its instability and tendency towards <bold>R</bold> is an inherent property of the Hb <bold>T</bold> X-ray structure. However, we also note that further studies will be required to fully rationalize that finding.</p>
<p>We have analyzed the correlation between the quaternary and tertiary conformational transitions during six independent <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transitions, as measured from the mutual information. The analysis shows that, during the <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition, the β subunits are substantially stronger coupled to the quaternary transition than the α subunits. The internal transitions of the four subunits seem relatively uncorrelated, with the exception of a slight correlation between the β subunits, which may however originate from the coupling from each of the β subunits to the quaternary transition, rather than from a direct coupling between the β1 and β2 subunits. Together with the tertiary distributions in a given quaternary state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), these results allow one to extract a consensus <bold>T</bold>-<bold>R</bold> transition pathway from the simulations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g008">Fig. 8</xref>. Squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g008">Fig. 8</xref> stand for <bold>T</bold>/<bold>t</bold> structures, circles for <bold>R</bold>/<bold>r</bold> structures, and squares with round corners for intermediate structures between <bold>T</bold>/<bold>t</bold> and <bold>R</bold>/<bold>r</bold>. We stress that these symbols represent structural similarity to the X-ray structures (or between them), and may not be equivalent to the low-affinity and high-affinity states present in solution. In simulations starting from the <bold>T</bold> X-ray structure (top in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), two possible pathways towards the quaternary <bold>R</bold> structure were observed. (a) A <italic>partial</italic> quaternary <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition simultaneously to a <italic>full</italic> <bold>t</bold>→<bold>r</bold> transition of the β subunits, or (b), a <italic>full</italic> <bold>T</bold>→<bold>R</bold> transition simultaneously to a <italic>partial</italic> <bold>t</bold>→<bold>r</bold> transition of the β subunits. Subsequently, the remaining quaternary transition (c) or the remaining tertiary transition of the β subunits was found to occur (d). The transitions of the two β subunits frequently occurred time-delayed to each other, rationalizing the low mutual information between the tertiary transitions of the two β subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, an intermediate pathway between (a/c) and (b/d) is not excluded, with the transition of β1 being completed simultaneously to a partial quaternary transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), and the transition of the β2 subunit completed simultaneously to the remaining quaternary transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). The remaining <bold>t</bold>→<bold>r</bold> transition of the α subunits was typically not observed or occurred only partly during the simulations (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). In simulations starting from <bold>R</bold> (bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), the α subunits carried out a partial or full tertiary transition to <bold>t</bold> without a quaternary transition. Although we did not observe full <bold>R</bold>-<bold>R2</bold> transitions within simulation time, simulations starting from <bold>R</bold> and <bold>R2</bold> sample common configurational space (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000774-g002">Fig. 2A/C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000774.s003">S2C</xref>), suggesting that <bold>R</bold> is in thermal equilibrium with <bold>R2</bold>.</p>

<p>The initial structures for the simulations starting from the <bold>R</bold>, <bold>R2</bold>, and <bold>T</bold> state were taken from the protein data bank (PDB codes 1IRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Park1">[26]</xref>, 1BBB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Silva1">[7]</xref> and 2HHB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000774-Fermi1">[27]</xref>, respectively) and protonated using the pdb2gmx software.

Each box was neutralized by adding 10 more sodium ions (8 in T/R.noHC3 systems) than chloride ions.
