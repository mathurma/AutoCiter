<abstract>
<p>Characterizing interactions between drugs is important to avoid potentially harmful combinations, to reduce off-target effects of treatments and to fight antibiotic resistant pathogens, among others. Here we present a network inference algorithm to predict uncharacterized drug-drug interactions. Our algorithm takes, as its only input, sets of previously reported interactions, and does not require any pharmacological or biochemical information about the drugs, their targets or their mechanisms of action. Because the models we use are abstract, our approach can deal with adverse interactions, synergistic/antagonistic/suppressing interactions, or any other type of drug interaction. We show that our method is able to accurately predict interactions, both in exhaustive pairwise interaction data between small sets of drugs, and in large-scale databases. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be used efficiently to discover interactions of new drugs as part of the drug discovery process.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Over one in four adults older than 57 in the US take five or more prescriptions at the same time; as many as 4% are at risk of a major adverse drug-drug interaction. Potentially beneficial effects of drug combinations, on the other hand, are also important. For example, combinations of drugs with synergistic effects increase the efficacy of treatments and reduce side effects; and suppressing interactions between drugs, in which one drug inhibits the action of the other, have been found to be effective in the fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. With thousands of drugs in the market, and hundreds or thousands being tested and developed, it is clear that we cannot rely only on experimental assays, or even mechanistic pharmacological models, to uncover new interactions. Here we present an algorithm that is able to predict such interactions. Our algorithm is parameter-free, unsupervised, and takes, as its only input, sets of previously reported interactions. We show that our method is able to accurately predict interactions, even in large-scale databases containing thousands of drugs, and that it can be used efficiently to discover interactions of new drugs as part of the drug discovery process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding interactions between drugs is becoming increasingly important. A recent large-scale study of older adults (ages 57–85) in the U.S. found that 29% of them use five or more prescription medications concurrently, and that as many as 4% may be at risk of having a major adverse drug-drug interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Qato1">[1]</xref>. For this reason, the evaluation of drug interactions is “an integral part of drug development and regulatory review prior to its market approval” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, and institutions like the FDA put much effort in developing guidelines for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, as well as for developing <italic>in silico</italic> models and methods.</p>
<p>Potentially beneficial effects of drug interactions, on the other hand, are equally important. Indeed, some drugs show synergistic effects against their targets, which not only increases the efficacy of treatments but may also improve the selectivity and reduce off-target effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Lehr1">[3]</xref>. Antagonistic interactions can be used to study the mechanisms of action of drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh1">[4]</xref>, and even suppressing interactions between drugs, in which one drug inhibits the action of the other, have been found to be potentially very relevant in the fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Chait1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>More broadly, it is becoming increasingly clear that drug interactions leading to network effects at a systems level are the norm in pharmacology, rather than the exception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Fitzgerald1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Barabsi1">[11]</xref>. According to some, these network effects may even be at the root of the dismal results of attempts to develop single-target drugs, and of the simultaneous decline of drug development productivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Hopkins1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, network pharmacology is emerging as a new paradigm in drug discovery.</p>
<p>However, despite the conceptual appeal of abstract network approaches to drug development, one may argue that the contributions of network analysis have so far been relatively modest. Indeed, most of these contributions have been related to pointing out network properties that make certain proteins <italic>more likely</italic> to be good targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Berger1">[8]</xref>, for example connector versus non-connector enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Guimer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Guimer2">[13]</xref>, or central versus peripheral proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Barabsi1">[11]</xref>. These contributions notwithstanding, there is little in the form of actual, concrete, examples where network analysis has resulted in a clear application to the discovery of new drugs or to the study of the effects of existing drugs.</p>
<p>Here we present one such application. In particular, we use the information that is encoded in networks of reported drug interactions to predict uncharacterized interactions. Because the models we use are abstract, our approach can deal with adverse interactions as well as synergistic/antagonistic/suppressing interactions or any other type of drug interaction. We show that our method is able to accurately predict drug interactions, and that it can be used efficiently to discover interactions of new drugs as part of the drug discovery process.</p>

<title>A network approach for the inference of unknown drug interactions</title>
<p>For specific drug pairs, interactions can be predicted <italic>in silico</italic> from mechanistic or flux balance models of the pathways and processes in which their targets are involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Fitzgerald1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Folger1">[14]</xref>. However, this approach is difficult to generalize and is, therefore, inappropriate for large-scale identification of interactions and for the identification of interactions between drugs whose mechanisms are not fully understood. Another approach is to use statistical models based on molecular and pharmacological data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Zhao1">[15]</xref> but, again, such data is not always available. Finally, there are mechanism-independent methods to predict multidrug interactions based on maximum entropy approaches, but these require knowledge of pair interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Wood1">[16]</xref>, which is what we aim to uncover here.</p>
<p>As in other biological problems, network theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Barabsi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Amaral1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Newman1">[18]</xref> provides a useful, although abstract, alternative to mechanistic and molecular modeling. In a network representation of drug interactions, each node represents a drug and each link represents an interaction between the corresponding pair of drugs. Interactions of different types (for example, synergistic versus antagonistic) are represented by links of different types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Stochastic block models for the prediction of unknown drug interactions.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Consider a hypothetical situation in which all of the interactions between drugs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are known with the exception of the interaction between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is, in reality, antagonistic. There are many partitions of the drugs into groups. The partition in (<bold>B</bold>) has high explanatory power (low value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003374.e091">Eqs. (5)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003374.e098">(6)</xref>), since most drug interactions between a pair of groups are of the same type. Therefore, the predictions of this partition have a large contribution to the estimation of the probability of the unknown interaction. Conversely, the partition depicted in (<bold>C</bold>) has little explanatory power (high value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and has a small contribution to the estimation of the probability of the unknown interaction.</p>

<p>Drug interaction networks contain explicit information about the interactions that are known, but also about implicit information about interactions that have never been tested; the question we are concerned with is how to extract this information from the network. Here, we present a network-based approach to predict an interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between drugs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from a network <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of known drug interactions (which includes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> but no explicit information about their interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Our approach deals rigorously with the information contained in the network by means of Bayesian model averaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Guimer3">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The approach is completely unsupervised and parameter-free.</p>
<p>Within our Bayesian model averaging approach, the only relevant modeling question is what family of models can accurately describe the network of drug interactions. In this regard, it is well established that pairwise drug interactions are largely determined by the cellular functions targeted by the drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh3">[22]</xref>. In network terms, this means that the interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is determined by the cellular functions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively; in other words, nodes can be partitioned into groups (by cellular function) such that the interaction between any pair of nodes depends only on the groups to which they belong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g001">Fig. 1B–C</xref>). Stochastic block models are a family of network models that mathematically formalize the idea of group-dependent interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-White1">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Nowicki1">25</xref>. Although originally proposed in the context of social interactions, stochastic block models are increasingly used to describe the structure of complex networks in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Guimer3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Newman2">[26]</xref> and for network inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Guimer3">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Again, after this choice of plausible models the resulting algorithm is completely unsupervised and parameter-free (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>To benchmark the performance of our algorithm, we consider two alternative heuristic approaches. The first benchmark is based on the idea that similar drugs have similar interactions. In this spirit, we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (respectively, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is a drug whose known interactions are as similar as possible to those of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a known interaction (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Second, we consider an approach based on the Prism algorithm, which was developed to identify groups of drugs (or genes) with similar interactions to other drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Segr1">[27]</xref>. Instead of averaging over all possible partitions of drugs into groups as done in our Bayesian model averaging approach, we take the partition proposed by Prism and use that partition to make the prediction (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we consider as a baseline the simplest possible algorithm for predicting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is to use the overall rate of each interaction type in the network. For example, if 60% of known interactions in a network are synergistic (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and 40% are antagonistic (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), then we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with 60% probability and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with 40% probability. This baseline captures the fact that it is harder to make a prediction when the ratio of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> interactions is 60/40 than when the ratio is, for example, 95/5.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Validation on exhaustive pairwise interaction data</title>
<p>We start by testing the algorithms described above against two experiments in which all pairwise interactions between a small set of drugs were exhaustively tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Cokol1">[28]</xref>. In the first experiment, Yeh and coworkers tested the effect of all pairwise combinations of 21 antibiotics on <italic>E. coli</italic>'s growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh2">[20]</xref>. They classified each interaction as synergistic, additive, antagonistic or suppressing. In the second experiment, Cokol and coworkers studied the effect of all pairwise combinations of 13 anti-fungal drugs on the growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Cokol1">[28]</xref>. They classified interactions as synergistic, additive or antagonistic (except for some interactions that were unresolved).</p>
<p>To study the performance of the algorithms, we simulate situations in which not all pairwise interactions are known. In particular, we simulate a situation in which only a fraction of all interactions are observed, and then try to predict the unobserved interactions (repeated random sub-sampling validation). In each case, we measure the fraction of predictions that are exactly correct (exact classification), as well as the fraction of predictions that deviate from the experimental observation by at most <italic>one level</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> classification). For example, miss-predicting a synergistic interaction as additive is considered correct by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> classification metric, but miss-predicting a synergistic as antagonistic or suppressing (or vice versa), or an additive as suppressing (or vice versa) is considered incorrect.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g002">Fig. 2</xref> we show the results of the validation. As expected, the stochastic block model, the neighbor-based and the Prism-baed predictions have accuracies well above the baseline, even when as many as 80% of the interactions are unobserved. In the majority of cases, the stochastic block model is significantly and consistently more accurate than the neighbor-based and the Prism-based predictions with one exception: when the fraction of observed interactions is high (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>%) in the Cokol dataset, in which the neighbor-based prediction is best. Note that as soon as the number of interaction types grows (from 3 in Cokol to 4 in Yeh) or the fraction of observed interactions decreases, the stochastic block model becomes more accurate. Moreover, even when the neighbor-based exact predictions are more accurate, ±1 predictions are always more accurate for the stochastic block model.</p>

<title>Performance of drug interaction inference methods on exhaustive pair interaction data.</title>

We simulate situations in which only a fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all interactions are observed, and then try to predict the unobserved interactions (repeated random sub-sampling validation).

<p>Although the absolute differences of prediction accuracy between the stochastic block model and the neighbor-based approach may seem modest (typically, between 5 and 10 percent points), it is important to note that relative to the baseline the improvements are quite major (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g002">Fig. 2E–F</xref>). Indeed, when the fraction of observed interactions is 50%, the stochastic block model represents a 29% and a 63% improvement (for the Cokol and Yeh datasets, respectively) in exact classifications over the neighbor-based approach, and a 55% and 66% over the Prism-based approach (always, with respect to the baseline). When we only observe 20% of the interactions, the relative improvements are 126% and 133% over neighbor-based predictions, and 61% and 154% over Prism-based predictions.</p>

<title>Validation on evolving databases of drug interactions</title>
<p>Next, we test our algorithm against the existence of adverse drug interactions in two drug interaction databases: the database available through the web site Drugs.com and the DrugBank database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Wishart1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Knox1">[30]</xref>. For the Drugs.com database, we restrict our analysis to major adverse interactions between generic drugs; for the DrugBank, we consider all interactions.</p>
<p>We consider two snapshots of each of the databases. For the Drugs.com database, we collected the first snapshot in May 10, 2010, and the second one in February 22, 2012. A total of 1,518 drugs are listed in both snapshots. There are 32,074 drug interactions present in both instances of the network; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> novel interactions present in the 2012 dataset but not in the 2010 dataset, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> spurious interactions present in the 2010 dataset but not present in the 2012 dataset. For the DrugBank dataset, the first snapshot corresponds to January 2009, and the second to April 2012. A total of 1,012 drugs are listed in both snapshots; there are 9,113 drug interactions present in both instances of the network, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We evaluate to what extent could our network algorithms have predicted which interactions needed to be added to each of the first snapshots (that is, to what extent can the algorithms uncover novel interactions), and which ones needed to be removed (that is, to what extent can they detect spurious interactions). As we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, the algorithm based on stochastic block models is able to accurately uncover spurious and, especially, novel interactions. In contrast, neighbor-based and Prism-based predictions perform only marginally better than the baseline.</p>

<p>First, we measure the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g003">Fig. 3A–B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Hanley1">[31]</xref>. In the case of uncovering novel interactions, the AUROC gives the probability that an interaction randomly chosen from those that were added to the first snapshot has a higher score than one randomly chosen from the set of interactions that were never added to the network. For the Drugs.com database, we find this probability to be 0.87 for the stochastic block model, 0.53 for neighbor-based predictions, and 0.52 for Prism-based predictions. For the DrugBank dataset, these probabilities are 0.71, 0.52 and 0.53, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, when dealing with spurious interactions, the AUROC gives the probability that an interaction randomly chosen from those that were removed from the 2010 snapshot has a lower score than one randomly chosen from the set of interactions that were not removed from the network. For the Drugs.com database, we find this probability to be 0.73 for the stochastic block model, 0.51 for neighbor-based predictions, and 0.45 for Prism-based predictions. For the DrugBank dataset, these probabilities are 0.61, 0.50 and 0.50, respectively.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to analyze the sensitivity-specificity curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g003">Fig. 3C–F</xref>). Consider first the results for the Drugs.com database. For the most pressing case of uncovering previously unreported major drug interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), we find that at 95% sensitivity, the stochastic block model has a specificity of 62%, that is, that we could have built, in 2010, a list of potential interactions containing 95% of the interactions that were actually added to the database, and excluding 62% of those that were never added. Conversely, at 95% specificity we obtain a sensitivity of 45%, that is, a list containing only 5% of the interactions that were never added to the network would have included close to half of all the interactions that were actually added to the database. While results for spurious interactions and for the DrugBank dataset are more modest, our method, unlike the neighbor-based or the Prism-based algorithms, has significant predictive power in all the cases we study.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Application to drug discovery</title>
<p>Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to discover interactions of novel drugs as part of the drug discovery process. In particular, consider a lab that has developed a new drug <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which is known to have a harmful interaction with another drug <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Ideally, the lab wants to identify all other drugs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that also have harmful interactions with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since in principle there are as many potential interactions as drugs in the market (more than 1,000, according to the Drugbank and Drugs.com databases), it would be extremely costly to test all possible interactions experimentally. Considering that the typical drug interacts with approximately 20–40 other drugs (in DrugBank and Drugs.com, respectively), random testing for interactions would require 35–55 experiments to uncover a single harmful interaction.</p>
<p>Lacking any knowledge about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (other than its interaction with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), our algorithm can guide experiments by identifying those drugs that are most likely to interact with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In particular, we could use the stochastic block model inference approach to predict the most likely interaction, test it in the lab, and iterate the process adding, at each iteration, whatever interaction information the lab assay gave.</p>
<p>To test whether such an approach would work in practice, we have simulated the discovery of two drugs whose interactions are in fact known and reported in the 2012 snapshot of DrugBank—acetophenazine and cinacalcet (these drugs were selected randomly among those with 10 to 20 interactions). For each of these drugs, we proceed exactly as if no data were available in the database except for one seed interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which we also choose at random. From the seed interaction and interaction data for all drugs other than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we use the stochastic block model approach to infer the next most likely interaction of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, check if the interaction truly exist, add this information to the network, and iterate.</p>
<p>As we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003374-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, the results are very promising. For acetophenazine, the 16 iterations we carry out are enough to discover 11 of the 15 interactions that are reported in DrugBank. For cinacalcet, we are able to uncover 8 of the 12 reported interactions. As mentioned above, these numbers need to be compared with the approximately 55 experiments that would be necessary to uncover a single interaction without any guidance.</p>

<title>Inference of drug interactions as part of the process of drug discovery and development.</title>
<p>For each of the two drugs ((<bold>A</bold>) acetophenazine and (<bold>B</bold>) cinacalcet) we simulate an iterative process in which a plausible interaction is suggested by the stochastic block model inference approach, the interaction is tested, and information is added to the network of known drug-drug interactions. The graphs display the number of true interactions discovered as a function of the number of experiments carried out. Green dots represent true interactions, whereas red dots represent drugs that were suggested as interaction candidates but turned out not to interact with the target drug. For acetophenazine, the 16 iterations we carry out are enough to discover 11 of the 15 interactions that are reported in DrugBank. For cinacalcet, we are able to uncover 8 of the 12 reported interactions. The gray region indicates the feasible region of discovery. Its upper bound corresponds to discovering all interactions without ever testing a drug that does not interact with the target drug; the lower bound corresponds to randomly exploring all possible interactions. In the lower bound, it takes around 100 experiments to uncover each interaction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is a pressing need to elucidate and understand interactions between drugs. With thousands of drugs in the market, and hundreds or thousands being tested and developed, it is clear that we cannot rely only on experimental assays to uncover interactions. Therefore, we need to develop computational data-mining methods to guide experimental analysis.</p>
<p>There are many possible approaches to predict drug interactions computationally. One is to mine patient data that are collected as part of post-marketing surveillance. However, this approach is problematic because of confounding factors that may not be properly accounted for in existing reporting systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Tatonetti1">[32]</xref>. Another approach is to use models based on molecular and pharmacological data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Zhao1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our approach is complementary to these efforts, and exploits the information that is encoded in the network of known drug interactions—since known interactions are the result of certain (known or unknown) “pharmacological rules”, we can infer “rules” from known interactions and then use the inferred “rules” to, in turn, predict unreported interactions (as we show in the Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003374.s003">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003374.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, the inferred “rules” correlate strongly with drug structure, category and target). Although the network approach has been frequently invoked as a new paradigm in pharmacology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Hopkins1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Berger1">[8]</xref> and there are large-scale databases that compile and report drug interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Takarabe1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Knox1">[30]</xref>, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to use network inference to predict drug interactions.</p>
<p>The network inference algorithm we have presented is very abstract and does not take into consideration any information other than reported interactions. It may be necessary in the future to complement the method with chemical, biological and/or pharmacological information. However, one advantage of our abstract approach is that, precisely because it is abstract, it can be easily extended to other kinds of pharmacological interaction data that can be represented as networks. For example, it is straightforward to extend our approach to predict associations between drugs and adverse side effects from <italic>pharmacosafety networks</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Cami1">[33]</xref>, protein- and target-drug interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yildirim1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Colinge1">[35]</xref>, or associations between drugs and therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Zhao1">[15]</xref> and drugs and diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Zhao2">[36]</xref>, which may help to guide drug repositioning. Our approach can even be used to predict gene-disease associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Goh1">[37]</xref> and, therefore, to uncover novel targets.</p>
<p>Another interesting extension of our approach is to predict multidrug interactions (that is, interactions between groups of three or more drugs), which are relevant to cancer treatment among others. Although it seems that knowledge of pair interactions may be enough to describe higher-order interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Wood1">[16]</xref>, within our framework tertiary interactions could also be modeled using three-dimensional stochastic block models in which the probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that three drugs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> interact depends only on the groups <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to which they belong. The generalization to interactions between any number of drugs is straightforward. All in all, we think that our approach opens the door to new ways of looking at and making predictions from pharmacological networks.</p>

<title>Implementation details</title>
<p>The sum in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003374.e098">Eq. (6)</xref> cannot be computed exactly because the number of possible partitions is combinatorially large, but can be estimated using the Metropolis algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Guimer3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Metropolis1">[39]</xref>. This amounts to generating a sequence of partitions in the following way. From the current partition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, select a random drug and move it to a random new group giving a new partition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, always accept the move; otherwise, accept the move only with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>By doing this, one gets a sequence of partitions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> such that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Metropolis1">[39]</xref><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003374.e109"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e109" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of samples in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>In practice, it is useful to “thin” the sample <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that is, to consider only a small fraction of evenly spaced partitions so as to avoid the computational cost of sampling very similar partitions which provide very little additional information. Moreover, one needs to make sure that sampling starts only when the sampler is “thermalized”, that is, when sampled partitions are drawn from the desired probability distribution (which in our case is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Our implementation automatically determines a reasonable thinning of the sample, and only starts sampling when certain thermalization conditions are met. Therefore, the whole process is completely unsupervised. The source code of our implementation of the algorithm is publicly available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://seeslab.info/downloads/drugraph/" xlink:type="simple">http://seeslab.info/downloads/drugraph/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/seeslab/drugraph" xlink:type="simple">http://github.com/seeslab/drugraph</ext-link>.</p>
<p>As often happens in Metropolis sampling, in general it is better to run many short independent sampling processes that a single very long sampler. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> reported here are obtained using 50 independent sampling processes of 200 (conveniently thinned) partitions each. These sampling processes can be run in parallel, taking on the order of 1–2 days to complete on high-end CPUs for the largest network considered here (with over 1,500 drugs). Sampling an equivalent 10,000 partitions with a single run can take 2–3 weeks.</p>

<title>Prism-based prediction of interactions</title>
<p>The Prism algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Segr1">[27]</xref> was originally developed to identify groups of genes that interact monochromatically, that is, that have the same type of interactions with genes in other groups. Yeh and coworkers then introduced Prism II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh2">[20]</xref> to identify groups of drugs relaxing the requirement for perfect monochromaticity.</p>
<p>Our implementation of Prism II is as follows. Each drug is initially placed in a group by itself. Then, groups are sequentially merged until all drugs belong to a single group. At each step, we merge the two groups with the smallest “distance” to each other. The distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between groups <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003374.e117"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e117" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>Here, the normalized drug-drug distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between drugs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003374.e121"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e121" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the number of interactions reported for both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>By itself, the Prism II algorithm returns a tree of nested drug groupings. To make interaction predictions, we need to: (i) set the free parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; (ii) cut the tree at a certain level to get a single partition of the drugs into groups (a process that needs to be unsupervised); and (iii) given those groups, determine the probability of each type of interaction. To cut the tree, we choose the partition with the smallest number of groups among those with total monochromaticity entropy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that satisfies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the partition that corresponds to putting all drugs in a single group. Additionally, we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to get results consistent with those reported in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003374-Yeh2">[20]</xref> (we also checked that these parameters yield good results for the Cokol dataset, and that the results do not improve using other values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003374.s003">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003374.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, once the groups are defined, we estimate the probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003374.e140"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e140" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(13)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003374.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are defined as above.</p>
