      <abstract>
        <p>The information processing abilities of neural circuits arise from their synaptic connection patterns. Understanding the laws governing these connectivity patterns is essential for understanding brain function. The overall distribution of synaptic strengths of local excitatory connections in cortex and hippocampus is long-tailed, exhibiting a small number of synaptic connections of very large efficacy. At the same time, new synaptic connections are constantly being created and individual synaptic connection strengths show substantial fluctuations across time. It remains unclear through what mechanisms these properties of neural circuits arise and how they contribute to learning and memory. In this study we show that fundamental characteristics of excitatory synaptic connections in cortex and hippocampus can be explained as a consequence of self-organization in a recurrent network combining spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), structural plasticity and different forms of homeostatic plasticity. In the network, associative synaptic plasticity in the form of STDP induces a rich-get-richer dynamics among synapses, while homeostatic mechanisms induce competition. Under distinctly different initial conditions, the ensuing self-organization produces long-tailed synaptic strength distributions matching experimental findings. We show that this self-organization can take place with a purely additive STDP mechanism and that multiplicative weight dynamics emerge as a consequence of network interactions. The observed patterns of fluctuation of synaptic strengths, including elimination and generation of synaptic connections and long-term persistence of strong connections, are consistent with the dynamics of dendritic spines found in rat hippocampus. Beyond this, the model predicts an approximately power-law scaling of the lifetimes of newly established synaptic connection strengths during development. Our results suggest that the combined action of multiple forms of neuronal plasticity plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of cortical circuits.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The computations that brain circuits can perform depend on their wiring. While a wiring diagram is still out of reach for major brain structures such as the neocortex and hippocampus, data on the overall distribution of synaptic connection strengths and the temporal fluctuations of individual synapses have recently become available. Specifically, there exists a small population of very strong and stable synaptic connections, which may form the physiological substrate of life-long memories. This population coexists with a big and ever changing population of much smaller and strongly fluctuating synaptic connections. So far it has remained unclear how these properties of networks in neocortex and hippocampus arise. Here we present a computational model that explains these fundamental properties of neural circuits as a consequence of network self-organization resulting from the combined action of different forms of neuronal plasticity. This self-organization is driven by a rich-get-richer effect induced by an associative synaptic learning mechanism which is kept in check by several homeostatic plasticity mechanisms stabilizing the network. The model highlights the role of self-organization in the formation of brain circuits and parsimoniously explains a range of recent findings about their fundamental properties.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The computations performed by cortical circuits depend on their detailed patterns of synaptic connection strengths. While the gross patterning of connections across different cortical layers has been well described in some cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Douglas1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Lefort1">[2]</xref>, the detailed connectivity structure between groups of cells and its relation to information processing have been notoriously difficult to investigate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Helmstaedter1">[3]</xref>. This detailed structure could either be largely random – the product of somewhat arbitrary growth processes, or it could be highly organized. On the one hand, randomly structured networks have been shown to possess powerful computational properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-VanVreeswijk1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Maass1">[6]</xref> and they are easy to generate. On the other hand, a precise non-random organization could be the product of network self-organization, where network structure determines neural activity patterns and activity patterns in turn shape network structure through plasticity mechanisms. At the macroscopic and mesoscopic scales, models based on self-organization have already explained fundamental features of brain networks. Examples are the formation of topographic mappings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Willshaw1">[7]</xref> or properties of orientation preference maps in primary visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Obermayer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Kaschube1">[9]</xref>. Here we show that fundamental aspects of the microscopic structure of cortical networks can also be understood as the product of self-organization.</p>
      <p>Self-organization typically relies on a combination of self-reinforcing (positive feedback) processes that are combined with a competition for limited resources. In the context of Neuroscience, an example of a self-reinforcing process may be that correlated firing of two groups of neurons may strengthen synaptic connections between them according to Hebb's postulate of synaptic plasticity, while the strengthened connections will in turn amplify the correlated firing of the neurons. An example for competition for a limited resource may be a synaptic scaling mechanism that limits the sum of a neuron's synaptic efficacies such that one synapse can only grow at the expense of others. The combination of self-reinforcing mechanisms with limited resources often gives rise to the formation of structural patterns, which may or may not have specific functional advantages. Here, we will offer an explanation for fundamental aspects of the fluctuations of synaptic strength and the distribution of synaptic efficacies based on self-organization.</p>
      <p>Specifically, recent evidence shows that the distribution of synaptic efficacies is highly skewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Feldmeyer1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Arellano1">[11]</xref>, having an approximately lognormal distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Song1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Loewenstein1">[14]</xref>. Only around 20% of synapses are responsible for 50% of total synaptic weight. Importantly, synaptic contacts are constantly being created and destroyed and sizes of dendritic spines are fluctuating over time scales of hours and days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Loewenstein1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yasumatsu1">[15]</xref>. In the face of this highly dynamic network structure, stable long-term memories are thought to be based on subsets of synapses with long life times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Trachtenberg1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Grutzendler1">[17]</xref>, which may also be comparatively strong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Trachtenberg1">[16]</xref>. In line with this, the daily fluctuations of dendritic spine sizes, which are closely related to synaptic efficacies, are such that weak synapses can change their size by as much as a factor of 6, while strong synapses are much more stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yasumatsu1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To investigate whether and how these properties can arise from self-organization induced by neuronal plasticity mechanisms, we have developed a self-organizing recurrent network (SORN) model. It extends a previous model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Lazar1">[18]</xref>, and consists of noisy binary threshold spiking neurons (80% excitatory and 20% inhibitory) and uses five different forms of plasticity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Connections between excitatory neurons are subject to an additive spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule that changes synaptic strength in a temporally asymmetric causal fashion as reported experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Markram1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Bi1">[20]</xref>. A synaptic normalization mechanism keeps the sum of all excitatory weights to a neuron constant and models classic findings on multiplicative synaptic scaling of synaptic efficacies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Turrigiano1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Abbott1">[22]</xref>. An intrinsic plasticity mechanism adjusts the firing thresholds of excitatory neurons to maintain a low average firing rate. This mechanism models homeostatic changes in neuronal excitability through modification of voltage gated ion channels observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Desai1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Zhang1">[24]</xref>. Connections from inhibitory neurons onto excitatory neurons are subject to an inhibitory spike-timing dependent plasticity (iSTDP) rule that balances the amount of excitatory and inhibitory drive that the excitatory neurons receive as reported in recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Haas1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Vogels1">[27]</xref>. Finally, a structural plasticity rule generates new synaptic connections between excitatory cells at a small rate. This models the constant generation of new synaptic contacts observed in cortex and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yasumatsu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-JohansenBerg1">[28]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We simulated networks of 200 excitatory and 40 inhibitory neurons for 10,000 time steps and observed the resulting activity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and distributions of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The network shows irregular activity patterns reminiscent of cortical recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Inter-spike interval (ISI) distributions are well fitted by an exponential function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and coefficient of variation (CV) values are close to one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) as would be expected from a Poisson process. Neurons show only very weak correlations of their firing during this phase of network development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

        <p>To estimate the probability distribution governing excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic strengths we bin connection strengths and divide the number of occurrences in each bin by the bin size. The bin sizes are uniform on the log scale. To mimic experimental procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yasumatsu1">[15]</xref>, very small synapses (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002848.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are excluded. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g002">Fig. 2A–D</xref> shows the distribution of synaptic connection strengths after 10,000 time steps and compares it to EPSP data from rat visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Song1">[12]</xref>. With distinctly different initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), the network faithfully develops a long-tailed distribution of connection strengths that is similar to the biological data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002848.s001">Text S1</xref> for details). Experimental data and model results are both well fit by lognormal distributions.</p>
        <p>As the network evolves it goes through different phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The initial phase is characterized by a <italic>decay</italic> of connectivity, where a substantial fraction of the excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic weights get eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). In the subsequent <italic>growth</italic> phase, the network connectivity recovers through the integration of newly created synapses produced by the structural plasticity. Eventually, the degree of connectivity stabilizes and the network enters into a <italic>stable</italic> regime. Here, connectivity fluctuates very little (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> inset). Newly created synapses tend to quickly disappear and there is a large stable backbone of connections with extremely long life times (as long as we simulated). The distribution of excitatory-to-excitatory connection strengths is lognormal-like throughout most of the network's evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g003">Fig. 3B–D</xref>). (see Fig. S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002848.s002">Text S2</xref> for more results with different parameters). An exception is the transition from the decay to the growth phase, where large deviations from the lognormal shape are observed (not shown). However, the distribution of synaptic weights maintains a long tail and a positive skewness throughout its development. The thresholds of the excitatory units in the network develop an approximately Gaussian distribution. In the stable regime of the network, this distribution is exhibiting only small fluctuations.</p>

We next compared the weight changes occurring in SORN over 3000 time steps with experimental data from time lapse imaging of dendritic spine sizes in rat hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yasumatsu1">[15]</xref>. In both SORN and the experimental data, strong synapses are found to have comparatively small fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g004">Fig. 4C–F</xref>). This is not a simple ceiling effect, since synaptic weights could, in principle, grow much larger than the typical values for very strong synapses we observe in the model, which lie between 0.2 and 0.3. There exists a small population of synaptic connections in both model and experimental data which decays completely (horizontal lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g004">Fig. 4C,D</xref> and oblique lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g004">Fig. 4E,F</xref>).

        <title>Multiplicative dynamics despite additive STDP</title>
        <p>To better understand the mechanism through which the network self-organizes its connectivity and dynamics, we examined how the strength of a synaptic connection influences its probability of undergoing further growth or decline. Among all the plasticity mechanisms, only STDP and synaptic normalization adjust the weights of EE connections. While synaptic normalization will only scale all incoming excitatory-to-excitatory connections linearly, STDP has the power to change the shape of the distribution of synaptic weights impinging onto a neuron. When we recorded the isolated effect of STDP, <italic>i.e.</italic> independently of the synaptic normalization, we found that over a large range of synaptic weight strengths, the expected increase in strength of a connection due to STDP grows approximately linearly with the strength of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The fraction of connections undergoing depression depends much less on connection weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, the net effect is that stronger synaptic connections have a higher chance to be potentiated by STDP establishing a rich-get-richer behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). This mechanism is kept in check by the synaptic normalization mechanism, which scales weights in a multiplicative fashion. We estimated the mean absolute change of synaptic connection strengths due to STDP and synaptic normalization over 200 time step intervals during the initial 10,000 time steps. The mean absolute sizes of fluctuations grow roughly linearly with weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) as observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Loewenstein1">[14]</xref>.

        <title>Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are essential for proper self-organization</title>
        <p>With all forms of plasticity present, the network will show irregular firing activity and develop a lognormal-like weight distribution. These results are stable over a large range of parameter values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002848.s002">Text S2</xref> for details). To investigate the extent to which the different forms of plasticity contribute to these results, we performed simulations where we switched off individual plasticity mechanisms. When synaptic normalization is switched off, the network will show bursts of high activity separated by long periods of inactivity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, the network keeps eliminating synapses as a result of STDP. The structural plasticity counteracts this process. If we switch off the structural plasticity, a large number of neurons eventually lose all their postsynaptic targets. No lognormal-like weight distribution will emerge if one or both forms of plasticity are missing.</p>
        <p>Intrinsic plasticity and inhibitory STDP both try to maintain a low average firing rate of excitatory cells and both are important to keep healthy network dynamics. If both are switched off, some units will exhibit very high firing rates while others remain essentially silent and all the phenomena shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g001">Fig. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002848-g005">5</xref> will disappear.

With all plasticity mechanisms active, the network activity is confined within a small area. Activity never dies out or becomes very big. When either intrinsic plasticity or inhibitory STDP is switched off, the network activity exhibits big fluctuations and can temporarily die out completely. In certain parameter regimes the network may function without one or the other, but with both mechanisms being present, we obtain robust results over a large range of parameter values. We conclude that all five plasticity mechanisms are important for proper self-organization.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Understanding the structure and dynamics of neural circuits and reproducing them in neural network models remains a major challenge. Classic models of STDP have been shown to lead to physiologically unrealistic bimodal weight distributions under certain conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Song2">[29]</xref>. This has lead to the proposal of a number of modifications to STDP rules to remedy the problem. Specifically, multiplicative STDP rules have received much interest recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-VanRossum1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Guetig1">[31]</xref>. Here we have shown that an additive STDP rule when operating together with other plasticity mechanisms in a recurrent network is sufficient to explain both the statistics and fluctuations of synaptic connection strengths observed in cortex. Associative synaptic plasticity induces a rich-get-richer dynamics of synaptic weights, while homeostatic mechanisms induce competition. With distinctly different initial conditions, the ensuing self-organization faithfully develops Poisson-like irregular firing patterns, lognormal-like weight distributions and the characteristic pattern of fluctuations of synaptic strengths reminiscent of cortical recordings. Beyond this, our model predicts a power-law scaling of the lifetimes of newly established synaptic connections during development. Our results suggest that the statistics and dynamics of neural circuits are the product of network self-organization, and that the combined action of multiple forms of neuronal plasticity plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of cortical circuits.</p>
      <p>It is important, however, to also consider alternative explanations. One of the simplest ways to obtain lognormal distributions is by virtue of Gibrat's law, which was originally developed in Economics. It describes the growth of companies by random annual growth rates which are independent of the companies' sizes. This process by itself, when applied to the growth of synaptic connections, would predict that the variance of the synaptic weight distribution would grow without bounds, which is clearly at odds with biological reality. Adding a multiplicative normalization mechanism such as our synaptic normalization rule to Gibrat's proportionate growth process retains the development of a lognormal-like distribution while avoiding the problem of unbounded growth. However, this model does not reproduce the pattern of weight fluctuations observed experimentally. Furthermore, such a model is purely phenomenological and does not describe the mechanism that <italic>causes</italic> the synaptic fluctuations in the first place.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the models proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yasumatsu1">[15]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Loewenstein1">[14]</xref> describe the fluctuations of synaptic weights as independent random walk processes, but do not explain what causes the synaptic fluctuations. In contrast, our model offers a <italic>mechanistic</italic> account that explains the patterns of weight fluctuations and the distribution of synaptic strength in terms of fundamental processes of neuronal plasticity in a recurrent network. This approach is consistent with the finding in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yasumatsu1">[15]</xref> that the fluctuations of dendritic spine sizes seem to strongly depend on activity-driven synaptic plasticity. Specifically, they found strongly reduced fluctuations of spine sizes and fewer spine eliminations when inhibiting NMDA receptors with APV or MK-801. Interestingly, the generation of new spines was unaffected by this manipulations. This is consistent with our model's assumption that the generation of new spines occurs via a process of structural plasticity that is independent of activity-driven synaptic changes. A further advantage of our model is that it can also be used to derive predictions regarding the emerging network topology in terms of clustering, network motifs, etc. This topic is left for future work.</p>
      <p>If our model is essentially correct, despite its very abstract formulation, then one should be able to replicate the present results in more realistic network models of spiking neurons. As a first step in this direction, we have constructed a version of the model using leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic parameter values. We have also adapted the plasticity mechanisms for this network. Initial explorations show that major features such as the lognormal-like weight distribution and the pattern of synaptic fluctuations can also be found in this less abstract network model. Future work will elaborate on these preliminary results.</p>
      <p>Since the structure of cortical circuits determines the dynamics of neuronal activity, it also determines how information is encoded and propagated. The existence of a small number of very strong synaptic connections may greatly facilitate the highly reliable propagation of signals along pools of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Abeles1">[32]</xref>. In fact, SORN networks have previously been shown to spontaneously develop encoding strategies based on trajectories through their high-dimensional state space of unit activations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Lazar1">[18]</xref>. In this work, the networks were fed with structured time series of input letters and were shown to learn internal representations of these input sequences that allowed large performance increases in prediction tasks. This was found to be due to the ongoing self-organization in the network driven by the network's plasticity mechanisms. They were shown to effectively increase the separation of network states belonging to different input conditions. More recently, we have found evidence that such networks may naturally self-organize to perform computations resembling Bayesian inference processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Lazar2">[33]</xref>. Further work is needed to better understand how the network's self-organization enables it to behave this way.</p>
      <p>Many computational models of local cortical circuits assume random network structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-VanVreeswijk1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Maass1">[6]</xref>, sometimes with distance-dependent or layer-dependent connection probabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Haeusler1">[34]</xref>. Such random network structure is at odds with recent evidence that changes to the connectivity structure such as the generation of stable new spines are associated with the formation of new memories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002848-Yang1">[35]</xref>. Hence, we believe that the study of random networks where only connection statistics are matched to those in the brain, may be quite misleading when the goal is to understand processing in cortical circuits. Instead, self-organizing networks, which can faithfully develop brain-like activity and connectivity patterns, seem a much more promising subject of study.</p>

If, however, the inhibitory neuron spikes and the excitatory neuron also spikes in the subsequent time step (the inhibitory spike was “unsuccessful” in preventing the excitatory cell from spiking), the inhibitory weight is increased by the larger amount <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002848.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.
