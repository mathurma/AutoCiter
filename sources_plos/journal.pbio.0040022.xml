				<article-title>Redundancy in Cortical Surface Vessels Supports Persistent Blood Flow</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>A highly interconnected network of arterioles overlies mammalian cortex to route blood to the cortical mantle. Here we test if this angioarchitecture can ensure that the supply of blood is redistributed after vascular occlusion. We use rodent parietal cortex as a model system and image the flow of red blood cells in individual microvessels. Changes in flow are quantified in response to photothrombotic occlusions to individual pial arterioles as well as to physical occlusions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the primary source of blood to this network. We observe that perfusion is rapidly reestablished at the first branch downstream from a photothrombotic occlusion through a reversal in flow in one vessel. More distal downstream arterioles also show reversals in flow. Further, occlusion of the MCA leads to reversals in flow through approximately half of the downstream but distant arterioles. Thus the cortical arteriolar network supports collateral flow that may mitigate the effects of vessel obstruction, as may occur secondary to neurovascular pathology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Normal brain function requires adequate levels of blood flow to ensure the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to cells and to facilitate the removal of metabolites and heat. The vasculature that supplies and regulates this flow is comprised of a succession of feeder vessels and networks with extensive redundant connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b002">2</xref>]. At the level of the supply to the brain, a pair of “communicating” arteries connects the carotid arteries to form the Circle of Willis. This loop is known to ensure a substantial level of fault tolerance to an occlusion of one of the member vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b003">3</xref>]. At the level of cerebral cortex, the branches of each cerebral artery form the artery's own network of communicating arterioles on the surface of its cortical territory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b004">4</xref>]. This network, in turn, gives rise to arterioles that plunge into the cortex and branch into the capillary bed. Each of the surface communicating networks is highly interconnected and, in addition, connects with the communicating networks of neighboring cerebral arteries through pial arteries called leptomeningeal anastomoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b005">5</xref>]. In analogy with the large-scale redundancy afforded by the Circle of Willis, the communicating network has been hypothesized to provide a robust source of collateral flow in the event of an occlusion of a microvessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b008">8</xref>]. Previous efforts to test this hypothesis, as well as the more general issue of the relationship between network topology and compensatory flow after an occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b010">10</xref>], have been hampered by a lack of methodology in which small vascular occlusions can be precisely targeted in time and space and in which flow can be quantified throughout multiple neighboring branches in a network.</p>
      <p>Here we address the issue of flow redistribution in a network of cortical communicating arterioles in rat parietal cortex that is supplied primarily by the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Our approach makes use of optical-based technologies. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b012">12</xref>] in conjunction with labeling of the blood plasma with fluorescein-dextran is used to form maps of the angioarchitecture as well as quantify the transport of individual red blood cells (RBCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b015">15</xref>]. Occlusions are performed in two complementary ways. In the first method, occlusions to individual targeted microvessels at the pial surface are achieved through the introduction of a photosensitizer to the blood stream and the subsequent irradiation of the microvessel with focused laser light. This technique requires, on the one hand, suprathreshold illumination of a surface vessel to form a clot and, on the other hand, subthreshold illumination of deep and lateral vessels to avoid undesired clots. Fulfillment of these conditions represents an extension of the conventional application of the photothrombotic clot method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b020">20</xref>] to allow for examination of dynamic flow changes in surface communicating arterioles after focal clot formation in a single surface arteriole. In the second method, an overall decrease in perfusion through the arterial source to parietal cortex is achieved by threading a filament along the carotid artery to block the base of the MCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b021">21</xref>]. This decrease necessarily leads to a change in the overall pressure balance throughout parietal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b022">22</xref>].</p>

        <title>Mapping and Perturbing Blood Flow in Communicating Arteriole Networks</title>
        <p>Large-scale maps of the fluorescent brain vasculature in the field of a craniotomy (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) reveal distal branches of the MCA as well as communicating and diving arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). A high degree of redundancy in the surface arteriole network is apparent, with anastomoses formed between vessels from both the same and different MCA branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Candidate vessels for photothrombotic clotting are identified from the maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and traced back to a readily identifiable artery or vein; we considered only target vessels that are arterioles. High-resolution planar images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) are used to determine the baseline diameter of the target as well as of the vessels that lie upstream and downstream from the target. Line scans, in which the laser focus is repetitively scanned along the axis of each vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), are used to form a space–time image in which the non-fluorescent RBCs are represented as dark streaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b024">24</xref>]. The sign and magnitude of the slope of the streaks reflect the direction and speed, respectively, of RBC motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). The analysis of this data yields a time series of the RBC speed in an arteriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). We average over time, typically 40-s epochs, to suppress the underlying cardiac contributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). We observe that the average speed increases with increasing vessel diameter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>), consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b025">25</xref>].</p>

The RBC speed is given by the inverse of the slope of these streaks; the direction of flow is discerned from the sign of the slope.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The line-scan method is accurate for large vessels only if the speed varies slowly across the diameter of the vessel. We thus measured the spatial profile of the average speed across both the lateral <italic>(y)</italic> and axial <italic>(z)</italic> directions and observe a profile that peaks in the middle of the vessel and smoothly decreases toward the vessel wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). The observed profile is flatter than that for laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a stiff pipe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), as expected for particle flow in a soft vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b026">26</xref>]. The smooth nature of the spatial variation in speed implies that the extraction of speed from the line-scan measurements is relatively insensitive to misalignment between the scan and vessel axes so long as the measurements are performed close to the center of the vessel.</p>
        <p>Once the baseline measurements of vessel diameter and RBC speed were completed, the photosensitizer rose bengal was added to the blood stream (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Green laser light, tightly focused on the target vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), was used to excite the dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). We monitored the clot formation in real time, as illustrated for the example of flow into a trifurcating vessel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>), and adjusted the laser power to near-threshold levels for clot formation. Once the clot was completed, the diameters of neighboring vessels and the speed of flow in these vessels was again measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Further, in control experiments the RBC speed decreased only slightly (5% per h) over 3 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>), which far exceeds the duration of a set of measurements after a clot.</p>

            <p>(B) Schematic illustration of the targeted photothrombotic occlusion of a vessel and experiment timeline. After baseline imaging and blood flow measurements, rose bengal is intravenously injected into the animal. Green laser light is focused onto the wall of the target vessel, which excites the rose bengal and ultimately triggers the natural clotting cascade. Surface vessels adjacent to the target vessel are not occluded because they are not exposed to the 532-nm irradiation.</p>
            <p>(C) Planar TPLSM images of photothrombotic clotting of a surface arteriole. The frame on the left is taken at baseline. The green circle indicates the region of the targeted arteriole that will be irradiated, whereas the white arrows indicate the blood flow direction, as determined from line-scan measurements in the targeted vessel and in the vessels downstream from the target. The numbers over the downstream vessels correspond to the numbered line-scan data shown in (D). The streaked appearance of the vessels is due to the motion of RBCs during the acquisition of the image. The center frame is taken after an intravenous injection of rose bengal and 2-min irradiation with 0.5 mW of 532-nm laser light. The vessel is partially occluded (indicated by green double arrow). The right frame is taken after one more minute of irradiation. The target vessel is completely clotted (indicated by red X) whereas surrounding vessels are unaffected. Stalled blood flow is indicated by the dark mass of clotted cells in the target region and the brightly fluorescent region of blood plasma upstream from the target region. Note that blood flow is maintained in the branches downstream from the target vessel by a reversal in the direction of blood flow in the center branch, as determined from the line-scan data in (D).</p>
            <p>(D) Baseline and post-clot line-scan data for the numbered vessels downstream from the target vessel shown in (C). The average RBC speed determined from the line-scan data is indicated for each case, with a positive speed taken to be along the baseline direction of flow.</p>

        <title>Localization of Photothrombotic Effects</title>
        <p>A combination of in vivo flow measurements and post-mortem histology was used to determine the effects of focal irradiation of the target surface vessel on non-targeted surface vessels and the underlying cortical parenchyma. Surface vessels located lateral to the target vessel were never observed to clot, consistent with their exposure to insufficient laser power to trigger photothrombosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). To reduce parenchymal damage deep to the irradiation site, the incident laser power on subsurface vessels was minimized by three physical mechanisms: (1) the absorption of incident light by the target vessel; (2) the divergence of the beam beyond the target vessel as a result of the strong focus; and (3) the scattering of light by brain tissue. Flow measurements were assessed in parenchymal capillaries situated less than 150 μm beneath the target vessel and within a lateral distance of 100 μm from the target vessel (55 capillaries, across six clots in four rats). In addition, flow was measured in control capillaries located at the same depth but 2 mm or more from the target vessel (18 capillaries). Flow was measured at baseline and after occlusion of the target vessel. The average flow speed across all capillaries was reduced to 57% ± 8% (mean ± standard error of the mean) of the baseline value and was highly variable (standard deviation = 64%). This reduction appeared to result from an increase in the normal occurrence of capillary stalls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b027">27</xref>], from a baseline level of 8% to a post-clot level of 30%. Flow in control vessels was 84% ± 5% of the baseline value, consistent with slow rundown over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>), and was less variable (standard deviation = 20%). In toto, these control data show that neighboring surface arterioles and venules remain unclotted after a target vessel is occluded. Further, clots in sub-surface capillaries are limited to vessels that lie directly beneath the target vessel, typically far from the downstream region perfused by the surface vessel.</p>
        <p>We assessed acute ischemic effects of photothrombosis across cell types with the hypoxia marker pimonidazole hydrochloride (Hypoxyprobe; Chemicon International, Temecula, California, United States). This probe forms an immobile adduct in viable but hypoxic tissue, that is visualized post hoc by antibody staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b028">28</xref>]. This marker was injected intravenously after clot formation and allowed to circulate for 1 h prior to sacrifice. As illustrated by the example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, the cortical distribution of Hypoxyprobe is highly sequestered in vessels and cells immediately below the photothrombotic clot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>A2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">3</xref>A4) within a volume of ~500 pl (four clots across four animals). Additional analysis revealed an increased tendency for the retention of fluorescein-dextran in the extracellular space that borders vessels that lie directly beneath a photothrombotic clot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>A3). In control experiments, we observed that irradiation of the brain surface in a region between surface vessels also led to fluorescein-dextran retention in subsurface capillaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>). These data imply that the pathology seen in capillaries beneath the target vessel is the result of photochemical damage, consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b029">29</xref>] and with our findings of increased capillary stalls beneath the target vessel. Critically, the territory of labeled Hypoxyprobe and fluorescein retention overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>A3). Thus there was no indication of wide-spread tissue hypoxia as a result of the focal clot formation in the surface arteriole.</p>

Lateral and medial directions are labeled by M and L, respectively. The intermediate- and high-magnification views show immunolabeling across neural compartments, including parenchyma and blood vessels (A2 and A4).

        <p>To probe ischemic cascades in hypoxic parenchymal vessels, we localized activated platelets by immunostaining with CD41 antibodies. Anti-CD41 immunoreactivity is also seen just below the clot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>B1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">3</xref>B3) and overlaps with retention of fluorescein-dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>B2). To assay potential damage to other neural elements, we probed for reactive astrocytes by immunostaining for the filamentous astrocyte protein vimentin, as this is strongly up-regulated in reactive astrocytes that proliferate in response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b030">30</xref>]. Vimentin immunostaining is relatively evenly distributed in the cortex, most likely in glial endfeet on vessels, but shows only negligibly increased staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>C1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">3</xref>C3) among those ischemic vessels that retain fluorescein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>C2). Together these data indicate that photothrombosis results in a restricted zones of marked vascular ischemia (five clots across five animals).</p>
        <p>To selectively assess neuronal integrity in the vicinity of photothrombosis, we stained tissue sections with antibodies that recognize microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2); MAP2 staining intensity is a sensitive and early indicator of neuropathology associated with ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b031">31</xref>]. As illustrated by the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">Figure 4</xref>, relevant tissue could be localized near a clotted vessel that remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and contained intra-luminal aggregates of nucleated blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The tissue near the clotted vessel exhibits near uniform staining for MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Only subtle neuropathology is observed below the clot as indicated by a slight loss of staining for MAP2 in layer 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and angulated neuronal somata with eccentric nucleus location and a corkscrew appearance in scattered dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). In general, there was no indication of severe neuropathology in neurons that lay directly beneath the targeted vessel (seven clots across three rats) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, we have achieved the desired goal of a localized clot to a single surface vessel with minimum collateral damage.</p>

        <title>Qualitative Aspects of Flow Rearrangement after a Single Arteriole Occlusion</title>
        <p>The essential consequence of an occlusion to a surface arteriole is illustrated by the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>. We observe that blood flow downstream from the occlusion is maintained through a reversal in the direction of flow in a vessel at the first downstream branch (middle branch, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">2</xref>D). The reversal occurs within 1 s, i.e., within the acquisition time of an image, after the target vessel was occluded. As a population across all experiments (47 clots in 34 rats with arterioles that ranged from 15 to 140 μm in diameter), flow reversal occurred in one vessel at the first downstream branch after 100% of the clots. In a subset of targeted vessels (<italic>n</italic> = 7), the clot broke free midway through the experiment and had to be reformed. In each of these cases, the pattern of downstream flow observed after reclotting was the same as that observed after the first clot.</p>
        <p>Three additional examples illustrate typical flow changes in vessels upstream as well as downstream from an occlusion of a communicating arteriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>; RBC speeds are shown for baseline and post-clotting conditions). In the circular architecture of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, the reversal of flow direction at the first branch downstream from the clot is accompanied by a decrease in the speed of the RBCs. An anastomosis that connects to the same MCA branch as the targeted vessel is clearly the origin of this reversed flow. In the tree-like structure of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, the reversal of flow direction at the first branch downstream is again accompanied by a decrease in RBC speed. A complicated pattern of reversed and non-reversed flow is observed in vessels farther downstream from the clot. In addition, flow is slowed in the upstream vessel that originally was a source to the targeted vessel (** in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), whereas flow is essentially unchanged in a parallel vessel that shares the same source as the targeted vessel (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). For the final example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), the targeted vessel was originally fed by the confluence of flow from two branches of the MCA. A photothrombotic clot results in a reversal in downstream flow, as well as a reversal in flow in one of the vessels that was a source of blood to the target vessel. The confluence of separate sources was observed to move to another point along the anastomosis between the MCA branches.</p>

        <title>Quantitative Aspects of Flow Rearrangement after a Single Arteriole Occlusion</title>
        <p>We now consider the systematics of changes in RBC speed as well as potential changes in vessel diameter that resulted from occlusion of the target. Vessels in the neighborhood of the target vessel were classified according to their topological relationship to the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>A): Upstream vessels (U) provided a source of blood to the target vessel; parallel vessels (P) shared the same source as the target; downstream vessels drained from the target vessel and are grouped as those immediately downstream (D1) and those two to four branches downstream (D2 to D4) from the target. We found that the RBC speed in upstream vessels slows substantially, yet the RBC speed in parallel vessels was increased slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, left). In two cases the target vessel was fed by a confluence of sources, and one of the upstream vessels reversed direction (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). For vessels that lie at the first downstream branch from the target, the average RBC speed is reduced and half of the vessels reverse their flow direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, middle). For vessels that lie farther downstream, the average speed is unchanged and the flow direction is reversed in approximately half the vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, right).

					 under the approximation of laminar flow. We find that the flux is reduced by ~55%, relative to the baseline value, for upstream vessels and slightly increased for parallel vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, left, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040022-t001">Table 1</xref>). For vessels downstream from the clot, the post-clot flux ranges between 5% and 200% of the baseline value, with the flux reduced by approximately 40% at the first downstream branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, center, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040022-t001">Table 1</xref>) and unchanged for vessels lying farther downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, right and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040022-t001">Table 1</xref>). We estimate that random errors in the measurement of speed and diameter contribute a 10% uncertainty to the estimate of the flux for each vessel and that drift in the flux contributes an additional 10% uncertainty (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). The observed spread in the baseline and post-clot values of the flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040022-t001">Table 1</xref>) is thus dominated by biological variability. Lastly, the changes in flux were correlated with changes in RBC speed for all vessels (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but the changes in flux were correlated with changes in vessel diameter only for the case of parallel vessels (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).

        <title>Flow Rearrangement after Occlusion of the MCA</title>
        <p>As a means to probe the possible ubiquity of reversals in flow in the arteriole communicating network, we studied the effects of a filament occlusion of the MCA on the flow in individual surface arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). This artery is the primary supply to the surface network. The arterioles measured in response to MCA occlusion were, on average, of larger diameter than those measured in response to photothrombotic occlusion. Similar to the case of the localized occlusion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we measured the speed of RBC flow and the diameter of vessels before and after occlusion of the MCA. The example data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, in which flow velocities are indicated in six of the surface arterioles, illustrate the essential results. The speed of RBCs was substantially reduced in five of these arterioles, consistent with a drop in the source perfusion. Critically, the direction of flow in four of the six arterioles was reversed after the occlusion.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We examined the resilience of blood flow in a network of communicating arterioles that lies in the territory fed primarily by branches of the MCA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Blood flow downstream from a targeted, localized occlusion does not stop, but rather is reestablished at the first downstream branch by a reversal in the direction of flow in one of the downstream branches (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">5</xref>). Such flow reversals are common phenomena downstream from localized microvessel occlusions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figure 5</xref>). They are also a feature within this territory in response to occlusion of the MCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The magnitude of the blood flow change following a localized occlusion in a surface arteriole depends on the topological relationship of a vessel to the clotted vessel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The average flow at the upstream and the first downstream branch is reduced by less than half, whereas the average flow in vessels parallel to the clotted vessel and far downstream from the occlusion remain near baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In general terms, this study has revealed the persistent nature of perfusion at the level of cortical surface communicating arteriole networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Our observation that, on average, the diameters of vessels remained constant after localized microvessel occlusion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040022-t001">Table 1</xref>) is somewhat surprising. Complementary studies on the acute effects of mechanical occlusion on vessel diameter report that the cessation of flow in MCA tributaries, realized through multiple ligations to the surface branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b032">32</xref>], leads to an immediate, apparoximately 20% increase in vessel size. An even larger increase has been reported immediately following the occlusion of the common carotid arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b033">33</xref>]. In contrast, a decrement in diameter of the MCA is seen after its occlusion by photothrombotic formation of a large, approximately 1.5 mm–long clot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b034">34</xref>]. On the chronic timescale of 1 mo, multiple ligations to the surface branches of the MCA led to dilation to 200% of the initial vessel diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b035">35</xref>]. In addition, other work has shown that cerebral arterioles, especially leptomeningeal anastomoses that connect the anterior cerebral with the MCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b005">5</xref>], show an approximately 50% increase in diameter 1 mo after MCA occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b037">37</xref>]. The dilation observed in previous acute and chronic studies has been attributed to active vascular regulation and/or to remodeling mechanisms. In contrast to these past results, we observe no systematic change in the diameter of downstream pial arterioles over a few hours in response to a small, approximately 100 μm–long clot formed in single surface arterioles by photothrombotic occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040022-t001">Table 1</xref>). One possible mechanism for this observed stability in vessel diameter may be that the new flow pattern is rapidly established, in about 1 s after the formation of an occluding clot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). Of interest, a classic means to demonstrate vascular auto-regulation in humans is based on modulation of the partial pressure of inspired CO<sub>2</sub>. However, recent work now shows that although cerebral blood flow undergoes predictable changes, the diameter of large cerebral arteries may be unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b039">39</xref>] or vary widely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b040">40</xref>].</p>
      <p>With regard to the magnitude of reperfusion in the vicinity of a localized clot, the observed flux was 60% of normal flow at the first downstream branch and 100% of normal flow at more distal downstream branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g008">8</xref>). The results of past studies suggest that flow rates must drop to 10% to 30% of baseline values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b043">43</xref>] before irreversible neuropathology occurs. Such damage is neither expected nor observed to occur under the conditions of this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">4</xref>), consistent with a past study of distal MCA occlusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b044">44</xref>]. In particular, we observed limited pathology directly below the clotted surface vessel, which was caused by photochemical damage to the capillaries, and no pathology in cortical regions that lie downstream from the site of clot formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">4</xref>). Thus the surface network of communicating arterioles appears to be well protected against single-point occlusions of surface arterioles by virtue of its architecture alone.</p>
      <p>The redundancy of brain vasculature changes as one proceeds from the level of the internal carotid arteries to that of the brain capillaries. At the level of the supply to the brain, the Circle of Willis provides sufficient redundancy so that all cephalic arteries are perfused in the event of an occlusion to one of the internal carotids. Blockages immediately downstream from the Circle of Willis, at the level of a cerebral artery, lead to a variety of neuropathologies. In particular, an occlusion to the base of the MCA typically results in infarction and widespread cell death in the basal ganglia whereas the same blockage produces less-severe deficits in the cerebral cortex or penumbral region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b044">44</xref>]. Compensation at the level of cortex has been attributed to flow through leptomeningeal anastomoses that connect the territories of the intact anterior cerebral artery and the MCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b005">5</xref>]. The present work demonstrates that functional compensations can also occur at the scale of surface communicating arterioles, formed through anastomoses between branches of the MCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">1</xref>B), since perfusion is maintained in neighboring branches after photothrombosis of a single arteriole (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g005">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">6</xref>, and 8). This failsafe mechanism most likely results from the many short-range loops in this arterial network, which may also play a role in rerouting a fixed supply of blood among different cortical columns during shifts in cortical electrical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b045">45</xref>]. The highly redundant cortical surface vasculature discussed here for rats is also present in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b046">46</xref>]. In contrast to the present results for the surface vasculature of cortex, the apparent lack of a similar system of anastomoses in the basal ganglia may contribute to its greater vulnerability after a blockage of the MCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b047">47</xref>].</p>
      <p>The present work focused on the surface network of communicating arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, CA), a two-dimensional network formed by anastomoses between branches of a cerebral artery. This network delivers blood to the cortical parenchyma through a series of diving arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, DA). The topology and resilience of the three-dimensional, subcortical microvascular network remain an open issue. From a technical perspective, the present methodology to form localized occlusions is ideal for surface vessels but cannot selectively target vessels at depth because, as for all techniques that rely on the absorption of a single photon, all vessels superficial to the target will also be affected. Thus a technology that depends on the nonlinear absorption of light is required. Such a technique, which makes use of high-fluence ultrashort pulses of light that can precisely ablate tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b048">48</xref>], has been demonstrated to work with vessels in superficial cortical layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b049">49</xref>]. This method cannot, in turn, be used to target clots in the surface communicating arteriole network, as the lack of containment by parenchymal tissue causes irradiated vessels to burst. Preliminary data suggest that clots to subsurface microvessels leads to perfusion failure in the immediate downstream vessels. This is in marked contrast to the redistribution of flow that preserves perfusion in all downstream branches of the surface communicating arteriole network (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g008">8</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g008">8</xref>E).</p>
      <p>In humans, damage to microvessels is a known pathological condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b054">54</xref>]. In particular, occlusion of small-scale arterioles is a likely cause of clinically silent lacunar infarcts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b055">55</xref>] that are correlated with an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b058">58</xref>]. It is thus interesting that the Rotterdam Scan study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b057">57</xref>], which identified clinically silent lacunar infarcts through magnetic resonant imaging, found that few cortical infarcts were located near the surface and thus where the vasculature appears to be most redundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040022-b046">46</xref>]. Our results for surface blood flow dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g008">8</xref>) suggest an emerging relation between vascular topology and susceptibility to stroke in different regions of the brain.</p>

The green-light beam underfilled the back aperture of the objective and was aligned so it focused at the center of the same plane as the near-infrared pulsed laser beam and formed an approximately 5-μm diameter spot. As the green-light overlapped with the fluorescent spectrum of fluorescein, the green-light was delivered in pulses of 1-s duration that were interspersed with TPLSM imaging.</p>
        <p>Vessels targeted for clotting were centered in the imaging field (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

        <p>Sections near the location of the clots were selected based on the location of the targeted vessels relative to the fiducial marks, as determined from widefield images of the craniotomy taken before and after the perfusion and the retention of fluorescein-dextran in capillaries beneath the target vessel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>A3). To confirm the completeness of a clot in the surface vessels, we looked for intra-luminal aggregates of blood-borne white cells by staining sections with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) mixed into aqueous mountant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Sections lying beneath photothrombotic occlusions were mounted onto Fisher Superfrost Plus slides (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States) and underwent antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) heated to boiling in a microwave oven (300 s at full power). The slides were incubated overnight in one of four monoclonal antibodies in diluent with PBS and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X–100 followed by incubation with a biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody: (1) Hypoxyprobe antibody (90204; Chemicon); (2) MAP2 antibody (M1406; Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States); (3) CD41 antibody (MAB1207; Chemicon); and (4) vimentin antibody (MAB3400; Chemicon). In all cases, bound antibody was visualized with the Vector ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States) using diaminobenzadine as the chromagen. The sections were cover-slipped with Prolong mountant (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States).</p>

          <title>Schematic of the Two-Photon Laser Scanning Microscope (TPLSM)</title>
          <p>Our realization is based on an 800-nm fs (femtosecond) laser with an integrated continuous-wave (CW) 532-nm laser for photothrombotic clotting. The CW laser, attenuated using neutral density (ND) filters, is directed onto the beam axis of the TPLSM with a dichroic mirror (600 nm–long pass, dichroic 1). An approximately 2-mm hole was etched in the coating of the TPLSM dichroic (dichroic 2) to allow transmission of the green laser beam. The 532-nm laser was aligned so it focused in the same plane as and at the center of the TPLSM image. The rat is bolted, via a metal head frame affixed to the skull, onto a two-dimensional translation stage that allows precise positioning of the rat relative to the TPLSM field of view and the CW laser focus.

          <p>(A) The brain surface was irradiated with 1 mW of 532-nm irradiation for 1 min after an intravenous injection of rose bengal. The laser focus was deliberately located in a region where there were no surface vessels; therefore no surface vessel was clotted. The vascular retention and parenchymal extravasagation of the fluorescein-conjugated dextran used for in vivo imaging is somewhat more extensive than that observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g003">Figure 3</xref>. This is likely because a surface target vessel was not present to absorb and scatter the incident laser light, leading to a higher fluence incident on the sub-surface capillaries, and increasing the extent of the photochemical damage.</p>
          <p>(B) A surface vessel was irradiated at 1 mW for 1 min without any rose bengal present. No retention of the fluorescein-dextran is evident in the sub-surface capillaries, indicating no photochemical damage.</p>

          <title>TPLSM for Photothrombotic Clotting and Characterization of RBC Flux</title>
          <p>A locally designed two-photon laser scanning microscope was modified to allow real-time photothrombotic clotting of individual cortical surface blood vessels. TPLSM line-scans were used to collect space–time data of RBC motion in individual cortical blood vessels, and an algorithm based on singular value decomposition was used to find the slope of the streaks formed by moving RBCs in this space–time data, thereby determining the RBC speed. Control experiments established that systematic flux changes in vessels due to intravenous injections or to shedding of clot material during the formation of a localized photothrombotic clot are less than 10%.</p>

          <p>This is the same example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040022-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Images are displayed at a rate that is sped up by a factor of 15. The fluctuating, streaked appearance of the vessels is due to the motion of RBCs, and indicates flow. The initial direction of flow in the targeted arteriole (vertically centered in image) is right to left, branching into three vessels on the left of the frame. A saturated white strip at the top of the frame indicates irradiation with 523-nm light. Clot material is formed just downstream from the irradiated region of the vessel, and some sheds off and is carried away down one of the downstream branches. Note that after a complete occlusion is formed, the streaked appearance is maintained in the downstream branches, indicating they are still flowing.</p>
