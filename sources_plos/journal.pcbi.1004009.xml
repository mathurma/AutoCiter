<abstract>
<p>Low copy number plasmids in bacteria require segregation for stable inheritance through cell division. This is often achieved by a <italic>parABC</italic> locus, comprising an ATPase ParA, DNA-binding protein ParB and a <italic>parC</italic> region, encoding ParB-binding sites. These minimal components space plasmids equally over the nucleoid, yet the underlying mechanism is not understood. Here we investigate a model where ParA-ATP can dynamically associate to the nucleoid and is hydrolyzed by plasmid-associated ParB, thereby creating nucleoid-bound, self-organizing ParA concentration gradients. We show mathematically that differences between competing ParA concentrations on either side of a plasmid can specify regular plasmid positioning. Such positioning can be achieved regardless of the exact mechanism of plasmid movement, including plasmid diffusion with ParA-mediated immobilization or directed plasmid motion induced by ParB/<italic>parC</italic>-stimulated ParA structure disassembly. However, we find experimentally that <italic>parABC</italic> from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> plasmid pB171 increases plasmid mobility, inconsistent with diffusion/immobilization. Instead our observations favor directed plasmid motion. Our model predicts less oscillatory ParA dynamics than previously believed, a prediction we verify experimentally. We also show that ParA localization and plasmid positioning depend on the underlying nucleoid morphology, indicating that the chromosomal architecture constrains ParA structure formation. Our directed motion model unifies previously contradictory models for plasmid segregation and provides a robust mechanistic basis for self-organized plasmid spacing that may be widely applicable.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>How DNA is stably inherited through cell division is a fundamental question in cell biology. The most common system that mediates plasmid DNA inheritance in bacteria is through a <italic>parABC</italic> locus, encoding proteins ParA and ParB, and DNA sequence <italic>parC</italic>. These components can position plasmids at equally spaced positions throughout a cell to ensure plasmids are present in both daughter cells when the cell divides into two. Here we study the mechanism by which ParA structures achieve this precise positioning. We show that ParA can direct relatively immobile plasmids over the bacterial chromosome using self-organizing, competitive ParA structures, whose disassembly is induced by plasmid <italic>parC</italic>-bound ParB. More generally these findings will help us to understand transport and regular positioning of intracellular cargo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>parABC</italic> loci generate equally spaced positioning of many bacterial low copy number plasmids, thereby ensuring stable plasmid inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Gerdes1">[1]</xref>. However, the underlying mechanism of action is not satisfactorily understood. In contrast, plasmid segregation mediated by actin homolog ParM is increasingly well explained and involves filaments that push plasmids apart in a mitotic-like process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Gayathri1">[2]</xref>. Understanding of the <italic>parABC</italic> mechanism is important, as it belongs to the most common class of DNA segregation systems in prokaryotes, used by chromosomes and antibiotic-resistance-carrying plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Gerdes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Fogel1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Derome1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, it is used in other conceptually similar processes, such as chemotactic cluster positioning and partitioning of carbon-fixing carboxysomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Roberts1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Savage1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>parABC</italic> locus present in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> plasmids such as pB171 and P1 encodes two proteins: ParA, a P-loop ATPase that binds DNA non-specifically in its dimeric ATP-bound form (ParA-ATP for short) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>, and the DNA-binding protein ParB that binds site-specifically to the <italic>parC</italic> region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard3">[11]</xref>. Fluorescence microscopy has provided evidence for ParA movement over the nucleoid with spatiotemporal oscillations in helix-like structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach3">[14]</xref>. ParB and <italic>parC</italic> are required for these dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach1">[12]</xref>, with ParB promoting the conversion of ParA-ATP to dimeric ParA-ADP (ParA-ADP for short), causing ParA to unbind from the nucleoid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>. The time period required for nucleoid-disassociated ParA to regain the ability to bind the nucleoid is sufficiently long <italic>in vitro</italic> to ensure that the relative locations of ParA-ADP unbinding and later ParA-ATP rebinding would be uncorrelated due to cytoplasmic ParA diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli1">[8]</xref>. However, once nucleoid-bound, whether ParA-ATP then polymerizes to form long filaments <italic>in vivo</italic> is currently controversial. Furthermore, the means by which plasmids move under the influence of ParA, and whether ParA polymerization is important for this movement, are also unclear. Nevertheless, the outcome of these ParA dynamics in <italic>E. coli</italic> is equally spaced positioning of plasmid foci over the nucleoid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sengupta1">[15]</xref>. This state is achieved regardless of the plasmid focus number n<sub>p</sub> or cell length, with plasmid foci repositioned in the wake of retracting ParA structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain ParA-mediated plasmid movement. One hypothesis proposes that ParA-ATP polymerizes on the nucleoid to form long filaments and that plasmid translocation is achieved by ParB-stimulated retraction of the polymers, generating effective plasmid-pulling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Fogel1">[3]</xref>, . Other proposals are based on ParA-ATP forming a gradient-like distribution on the nucleoid, without a necessity for polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Hatano1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Lim1">[21]</xref>. It is currently unclear whether any of these mechanisms can explain equal plasmid spacing given the known physiological and biochemical constraints. Here, we therefore investigate which aspects of the polymer and gradient mechanisms are required and sufficient to explain the observed plasmid translocation and equal spacing over the nucleoid.</p>
<p>We begin by showing mathematically that competition between dynamic ParA concentrations on either side of a plasmid can lead to equal plasmid spacing. This mechanism relies on an ability of a plasmid to move towards higher ParA concentrations, but the exact means of such movement is not important. We then investigate theoretically specific means of plasmid movement and examine whether predictions from such models are borne out experimentally. We define a computational diffusion/immobilization model where nucleoid-bound ParA-ATP can anchor diffusing plasmids. We show that diffusion/immobilization can in principle space mobile plasmids equally over the nucleoid. However, experiments measuring increased plasmid mobility in the presence of the pB171 <italic>parABC</italic> locus (<italic>par2</italic>), lead us to disfavor this model. Instead we favour a directed motion mechanism in which ParA structure formation provides directionality to plasmid motion thereby speeding up plasmid movement. The directed motion model produces robust equal plasmid spacing with, on average, relatively symmetric ParA distributions, a prediction we verify experimentally. Furthermore, we show experimentally that ParA organization is dependent on the underlying nucleoid structure, with nucleoid disruption resulting in perturbed plasmid positioning. Our combination of modeling and experiments has for the first time uncovered a robust mechanism for plasmid spacing that unifies previous proposals.</p>

<title>Mathematical analysis shows that dynamic, competitive ParA concentrations can generate equal plasmid spacing</title>
<p>Several studies have proposed that plasmid positioning is controlled by a concentration gradient of ParA over the nucleoid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Hatano1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli3">[20]</xref>. Intuitively in this mechanism, ParB bound to plasmid <italic>parC</italic> (ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complex) interacts with nucleoid associated ParA-ATP, which effectively anchors the plasmid to the nucleoid. At the same time, the ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complex stimulates ParA-ATP hydrolysis causing a local ParA-ATP depletion. These processes could then generate a ParA-ATP gradient which a plasmid is able to follow. Reorganization of ParA gradients under the influence of multiple ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complexes might then lead to equal plasmid spacing. To rigorously understand if, and with what requirements, equal spacing can be achieved we develop here a minimal mathematical model based on the above principles.</p>
<p>We model the nucleoid as a 1d system of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (along the long axis of the cell) on which ParA-ATP and plasmids can interact. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote the nucleoid-associated ParA-ATP concentration at position <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> relative to one nucleoid edge at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the positions of the n<sub>p</sub> plasmids. ParA can bind to the nucleoid with flux <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Once bound, ParA-ATP can diffuse along the nucleoid with diffusion constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For simplicity, we first assume that the ParA-ATP concentration at each plasmid is zero due to a high ParA-ATP hydrolysis rate. Later on we will relax this assumption. This system can be described by the deterministic reaction-diffusion equations:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e008"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>We now use separation of time scales to obtain the steady-state solution for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: we assume that plasmid motion is much slower than the time for individual ParA-ATP molecules to diffuse over the nucleoid and generate a concentration profile. In this way, the plasmid positions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are effectively time-independent and <italic>a priori</italic> unknown. The equation for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> then simplifies to:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e012"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>This equation can be solved by integrating twice using the boundary conditions. The solution is given by:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e013"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Next we use these equations to compute the diffusive fluxes of ParA-ATP, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, at a plasmid location <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where the + and – superscripts below refer to the flux from the right (+) and left (-) respectively. We find:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e016"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Clearly, a symmetric ParA concentration profile, where fluxes from either side balance, is only possible for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The plasmids are then equally distributed with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We note that the predicted inter-plasmid spacing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> arising from this analysis is consistent with our experimental findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s002">S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, the above analysis provides insight into the equal spacing mechanism. The key is that the above fluxes depend on the distances either between the plasmid and nucleoid end, or between neighboring plasmids. This feature is a consequence of ParA binding to the nucleoid anywhere, but with ParA release only occurring at a plasmid. In order for these on and off fluxes to balance at steady-state, the off-flux at a plasmid must scale with the inter-plasmid or plasmid-nucleoid-end distance. In this way, non-local information about lengths is converted into local spacing information encoded in the slope of ParA-ATP concentration. For non-equal plasmid spacing, the competing ParA concentrations on either side of a plasmid will be unequal, with one gradient steeper than the other. The steeper gradient corresponds to the side with the greater available space for ParA binding. If a plasmid can preferentially move (on the appropriate slow time scale) towards the side with the locally steepest ParA-ATP concentration, the plasmids are then progressively restored towards equal spacing. As this process occurs, the ParA-ATP concentrations will dynamically reorganize such that a symmetric configuration around a plasmid is reached only when the plasmids are equally spaced. In this state, where the competing ParA-ATP concentrations are symmetric, plasmid movement would no longer have a directional preference and would thus remain, on average, stationary.</p>
<p>So far, we have assumed that the ParA-ATP concentration vanishes at a plasmid, corresponding to very fast ParA-ATP hydrolysis. However, our results also hold true when we only assume that this hydrolysis occurs with a finite rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, leading to a non-zero concentration of ParA-ATP at a plasmid. This ParA-ATP can then anchor a plasmid to the nucleoid before being hydrolysed. This more general and realistic case is presented in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s008">S1 Text</xref>, but our overall conclusions reached above remain unchanged.</p>
<p>From the above analysis, we see that the following conditions are required for equal plasmid spacing: (1) movement of a plasmid towards higher ParA-ATP concentrations. (2) diffusion of (at least a fraction of) ParA-ATP over the nucleoid to ensure formation of competitive concentration gradients. Single molecule tracking experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> support this assumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Hwang1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli2">[18]</xref>. (3) ParA-ATP hydrolysis must occur (predominantly) by plasmid-associated ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complexes, again to ensure gradient formation. (4) ParA-ATP must adopt a 1d-like configuration, as previously claimed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach3">[14]</xref>. If ParA were not organized in this fashion, it would be possible for ParA to diffuse around the sides of a plasmid without encountering the hydrolyzing effect of the ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complex. This would equalize the ParA concentrations on both sides even in the case of asymmetrically placed plasmids, leading to failure of the equal spacing mechanism. This assumption is in line with our subsequent experiments (see below). Due to this proposed 1d-like nature, we will from now on refer to the ParA distributions away from a plasmid as ParA structures. (5) There must be a separation of time scales between plasmid movement and ParA concentration reorganization, as discussed above.</p>
<p>Importantly, this overall mechanism is not reliant on a specific type of plasmid translocation. Any process that would allow a plasmid to move into regions of higher ParA concentration will suffice. In the following sections we therefore analyze different means of plasmid movement and compare them with our experimental data to determine which is used in our <italic>par2</italic> segregation system.</p>

Using a minimal modelling approach, we assume that nucleoid-associated ParA-ATP can immobilize freely diffusing plasmids through its interaction with the ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complex and that ParA-ATP does not polymerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Since the plasmid will tend to become immobilized in regions of higher ParA-ATP concentration, this process allows for effective plasmid translocation up a ParA-ATP concentration gradient. We also incorporate ParB-<italic>parC</italic>-stimulated ParA-ATP hydrolysis at a plasmid, in accordance with prior experimental data. To further investigate this mechanism, given the known physiological and biochemical constraints, we developed stochastic simulations using a Gillespie algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Slepoy1">[22]</xref>. Here we use standard diffusion for the plasmid movement; below we discuss the potential impact of subdiffusive motion.</p>

<p>In our simulation, a one dimensional lattice with sites of size dx = 5 nm represents the nucleoid. ParA-ATP and plasmids can diffuse on the lattice with diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub>A</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>P</sub> respectively.

<p>Prior work has demonstrated plasmid displacement along the long cell axis of up to 3–4 µm within 10 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sengupta1">[15]</xref>. With a diffusion/immobilization mechanism all plasmid movement in between immobilization events is generated by (unbiased) free diffusion, for which we have (in 1d) a mean square displacement (MSD) of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. By inserting the above length and time scales into this equation, we conclude that a plasmid diffusivity of at least D<sub>P</sub>∼10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> would be required to generate sufficiently rapid diffusive movement in accordance with previous experiments. We therefore chose D<sub>P</sub> = 10<sup>−1</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. In order to physically justify that ParA can immobilise the plasmids, we chose the nucleoid bound ParA-ATP diffusivity to be lower than D<sub>P</sub>, with D<sub>A</sub> = 10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004009-t002">Table 2</xref>). We experimentally constrained the overall copy number of ParA for pB171 <italic>par2</italic> by semi-quantitative Western blots, which revealed that there were approximately 8×10<sup>3</sup> ParA monomers per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s001">S1B Fig.</xref>). This diffusion/immobilization model could produce equal plasmid spacing on simulated growing nucleoids with varying numbers of plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g002">Fig. 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s003">S3A</xref>). This result demonstrates that using a sufficiently high (low) plasmid (ParA) diffusivity, respectively, the equal plasmid spacing seen in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g001">Fig. 1B,C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s002">S2A,B Fig.</xref>) and previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>, could in principle be achieved using a diffusion/immobilization mechanism.</p>

<title>Free plasmid mobility is too low for a diffusion/immobilization mechanism</title>
<p>To test whether the requirement of a relatively high free plasmid mobility is met <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared the movement of test-plasmids with and without <italic>par2</italic>. We analyzed trajectories of labeled plasmid foci using the <italic>tetO-</italic>TetR-mCherry labeling system, measuring the positions over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and MSDs for each time lag τ. Plasmid motion will be biased by a functional <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> partitioning system, in contrast to the random motion of <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic>. Nevertheless comparing MSDs can still be informative in comparing relative overall mobilities. On time scales up to a minute we found that the <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> MSD is higher than in <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), showing that, on average, <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> plasmids are more mobile than their <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> counterparts. Note that the number of data points for the short time lags far exceeds the number of trajectories (n<sub>par-</sub> = 747, n<sub>par2+</sub> = 763), since every trajectory contains multiple short time lags. Consequently our estimates for the mean are relatively precise for short time lags. It is true that the error on the mean does not reflect inaccuracy due to experimental limitations in determining the actual plasmid position, for instance due to a finite pixel size. However, that error is the same for both <italic>par2</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>par</italic><sup>-</sup>. Moreover, since the error is also time lag independent, it is taken into account in our fitting procedure as a time lag independent term (for more details see below and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Overall, these results are hard to reconcile with a diffusion/immobilization mechanism where the <italic>par2</italic> system can only immobilize plasmids, and thus lower their MSD. These MSD values could in principle be limited due to cellular confinement. However, we found that MSD saturation only starts to occur at much larger length scales at times of up to 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In the presence of <italic>par2</italic>, plasmids generally reside within the nucleoid region, while in its absence they tend to become somewhat more polar localized, although they can still sample the entire cell volume on long enough timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Parry1">[23]</xref>. Consistently we still find many <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> plasmids located within the nucleoid region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s003">S3B Fig.</xref>). Restricting the mobility analysis to <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> plasmids within the nucleoid region did not alter the resulting MSD curves significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s003">S3B Fig.</xref>). We conclude that the presence of <italic>par2</italic> can increase plasmid mobility in the nucleoid region, which is inconsistent with a diffusion/immobilization mechanism. We emphasize that this conclusion can be made irrespective of the underlying (<italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic>) plasmid transport processes, which we now describe in more detail.</p>

<p>It has been reported that chromosomal loci and RNA-protein particles exhibit subdiffusive, rather than diffusive, behavior in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Weber1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Weber2">[25]</xref>. Therefore it is possible that plasmids without a segregation mechanism could also exhibit subdiffusive motion. Further analysis is required to fully distinguish subdiffusion from the additional effects of cellular confinement or glass-like properties of the bacterial cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Parry1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Weber2">[25]</xref>. Nevertheless such additional analysis is not required for the conclusions on <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> plasmid mobility relevant to this study, as we now explain. Subdiffusion results in an expected MSD displacement of the form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with α&lt;1 and D the apparent diffusion constant (in units of µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-α</sup>). We find that our MSD displacements on both short and long timescales are well described by subdiffusion with α = 0.7–0.8 and an apparent diffusion constant D = 5–10×10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−α</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). This is consistent with other recent reports on <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> plasmid mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Parry1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Polka1">[26]</xref>. Importantly the experimental MSD is lower on all observed timescales than a hypothetical particle that would perform free diffusion inside a cell with a diffusion constant D<sub>f</sub> = 10×10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. This upper limit is already much lower than that needed to be consistent with the previously reported plasmid displacement data discussed above. We will further exploit this upper limit in our analysis below.</p>
<p>To further investigate the effect of <italic>par2</italic> on plasmid positioning, we also studied rapid plasmid segregation events. We defined these as cases where two plasmid foci whose separation is initially ≤0.3 µm, move within 20 s at least another 0.8 µm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s003">S3C</xref>). We also allowed for the two foci to be initially merged. Using these criteria, despite equally large data sets, we found 13 such events in <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> and only one such case in <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic>. Furthermore, we only retrieved 2 further <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> segregation events when we relaxed the criterion to separation within 60 s instead of 20 s. This analysis shows that most segregation events occur rapidly. When we investigated the 26 plasmid trajectories involved they showed larger maximal MSDs compared to sets of 26 trajectories that were repeatedly randomly sampled from the whole <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> dataset (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). This finding indicates that the <italic>par2</italic> system can particularly enhance the mobility of plasmids when they are in close proximity. We then simulated 300 plasmid duplication events with our diffusion/immobilization model to determine the magnitude of diffusion constant required to generate the experimentally observed segregation. Note that we used diffusion rather than subdiffusion here because we have already determined that <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> plasmid movement is slower on all observed timescales than free diffusion with a diffusion constant D<sub>f</sub> = 10×10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. Hence, if the required diffusion constant is larger than D<sub>f</sub> then we have also ruled out a subdiffusion/immobilization model. We required that 5% (15 out of 300) of segregated distances within 20 s were at least 0.8 µm (a very conservative requirement, since the criterion was satisfied by 13 of our 15 experimental segregation events). This requirement necessitated a free plasmid diffusion constant on the order of 10<sup>−1</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, about two orders of magnitude higher than our experimentally observed upper bound D<sub>f</sub> on the experimental <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> plasmid mobility. Hence, we conclude that the plasmids are generally too immobile for a diffusion/immobilization (or subdiffusion/immobilization) mechanism to explain these segregation events. Also the qualitative behaviour of segregation events in the diffusion/immobilization model appears different, since experimental segregation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s003">S3C</xref>) show more directionally biased motion, while the diffusion/immobilization model generates more sustained random, diffusive motion during segregation, prior to immobilization at equally spaced positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Nevertheless, these segregation events were sufficiently rare not to significantly alter the overall MSD behaviour of the entire dataset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>. Thus the increased average mobility in the presence of <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> cannot only be ascribed to these segregation events.</p>
<p>It is possible that the <italic>tetO-</italic>TetR-mCherry labeling system caused reduced plasmid mobility as compared to unlabelled plasmids. However, as we used the same labeling method for both <italic>par2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> cases, our above conclusions on relative mobility are unaffected. Moreover, our <italic>tetO-</italic>TetR-mCherry labeled plasmids still exhibited rapid segregation events (such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), underscoring the ability of <italic>par2</italic> to overcome low plasmid mobility. Overall, we find that diffusion/immobilization cannot explain our data on <italic>par2</italic><sup>+</sup> versus <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> plasmid mobility, as well as on rapid <italic>par2</italic><sup>+</sup> plasmid segregation.</p>

<title>ParA structures competing to direct plasmid motion can space plasmids equally over the nucleoid</title>
<p>Given the shortcomings of the diffusion/immobilization model, we next tested models based on directed motion, allowing more rapid directed rather than unbiased diffusive plasmid movement. More specifically, we tested models based on the formation of competing ParA polymers, with ParB-<italic>parC</italic>-stimulated ParA-ATP hydrolysis directing plasmid movement. By modulating the length of these polymers, we thereby tested the robustness of directed motion models to generate equal plasmid positioning.</p>
<p>We again used a Gillespie algorithm to simulate ParA dynamics on the nucleoid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004009-t003">Tables 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004009-t004">4</xref> for details). The nucleoid was represented as a rectangular lattice (dx = 5 nm in both dimensions), with a much shorter width (30 nm) than length (several µm). Similar reactions as in the diffusion/immobilization model described the cytoplasmic dynamics of ParA-ADP and ParA-ATP. Nucleoid-associated ParA-ATP could also still diffuse across the nucleoid in a mobile state in all four directions to neighbouring sites with diffusion constant <italic>D</italic><sub>A</sub>. However, two of these molecules at sites neighboring each other along the long nucleoid axis could interact to form a ParA polymer of two subunits, with reaction parameter k<sub>p</sub>. Further ParA-ATP polymerization could occur by attachment of mobile ParA-ATP, located at a site immediately next to the tip of an existing ParA polymer, but only along the long axis. ParA-ATP polymers were assumed to be immobile. A ParA-ATP polymeric subunit could depolymerize spontaneously with reaction parameter k<sub>dp</sub>, i.e. be converted into a mobile ParA-ATP at the same site. Given that its size is similar to the width of the lattice, we only took into account the plasmid position along the long axis and we assumed that it occupied all sites along the short axis simultaneously. The plasmid could diffuse with our experimentally estimated diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub>P</sub> along the long axis when polymeric ParA-ATP was not present either at any of the sites that the plasmid occupied or sites neighbouring the plasmid. In the presence of polymeric ParA-ATP, the plasmid was assumed to be tethered to such a polymer (via a ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complex), which prevented plasmid diffusion. At sites with a plasmid present, polymeric ParA-ATP could be converted into cytoplasmic ParA-ADP with reaction parameter k<sub>B</sub>. Reflecting directed motion, at sites neighbouring a plasmid occupied by polymeric ParA-ATP, a plasmid could with reaction parameter k<sub>dm</sub> move to the coordinate along the long axis of that ParA-ATP subunit, coinciding with conversion of that ParA-ATP into cytoplasmic ParA-ADP. For wild-type simulations, any plasmid in the system formed a hard wall to mobile ParA-ATP diffusion so that diffusing ParA-ATP molecules could not diffuse past a plasmid.</p>

<p>We first adjusted the ParA-ATP polymerization rate to generate short filaments, of approximately 10 subunits in length (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004009-t004">Table 4</xref> for parameters). Simulations again faithfully reproduced the equal spacing of plasmids along simulated growing nucleoids with varying numbers n<sub>p</sub> of plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, n<sub>p</sub> = 1,2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, n<sub>p</sub> = 3,4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s004">S4A Fig.</xref>) in good agreement with our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s002">S2</xref>). By adjusting the ParA-ATP polymerization rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004009-t004">Table 4</xref>), long continuous ParA polymer bundles could also be generated. In that case equal spacing could also be achieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s004">S4B,C Fig.</xref>). Intuitively, in both short and long filament cases, this occurs because in an irregularly spaced plasmid configuration, the unequal ParA concentrations on either side of a plasmid result in an unequal degree of ParA polymerization. This in turn results in an unequal amount of competitive directed motion events to each side, resulting in effective directed translocation over longer length scales back towards an equally positioned state. Plasmid separation occurs when two nearby plasmids encounter two ParA-ATP structures extending in opposite directions away from the plasmids. The two ParA-ATP structures will then necessarily mediate a segregation event. The effect of directed movement in this model is clearest in the case of plasmid segregation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s004">S4B</xref>), where we see rapid segregation consistent with the fast segregation events observed experimentally (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>ParA-GFP oscillations are not continuously required for equal plasmid spacing</title>
<p>Intriguingly, simulations of the directed motion model did not generally produce sustained spatiotemporal oscillations of ParA across the nucleoid (short polymers: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, long polymers: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s004">S4B Fig.</xref>). A lack of sustained oscillations would therefore appear to be a common feature of models where competitive ParA structures generate equal plasmid spacing. This absence was unexpected, as prior experimental work had emphasized the oscillatory aspect of the ParA dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ebersbach3">[14]</xref>. To experimentally test this key model prediction in an unbiased fashion, we experimentally measured the degree of ParA asymmetry in the <italic>par2</italic> system in a large dataset (n = 134) of snapshots of ParA-GFP across the nucleoid. We examined only cases with a single plasmid <italic>tetO-</italic>TetR-mCherry focus, where sustained oscillations should be easiest to infer. The ParA-GFP fluorescence signal from pole to plasmid position was summed and divided by the respective pole-to-plasmid distance. This generated two ParA-GFP fluorescence densities I<sub>L</sub> and I<sub>R</sub> for either side extending to the two cell poles. This allowed us to compute the normalized asymmetry measure |I<sub>L</sub>-I<sub>R</sub>|/|I<sub>L</sub>+I<sub>R</sub>| <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sliusarenko1">[27]</xref> for ParA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Asymmetric ParA-GFP distributions, arising for example from oscillations, where for example I<sub>L</sub>≈0, I<sub>R</sub>≈1, will give asymmetry values closer to one, whereas symmetric ParA-GFP distributions, where I<sub>L</sub>≈I<sub>R</sub>, will give values closer to zero. Note that the ParA-GFP exposure time used here was 1.5 s; clearly, we cannot measure asymmetries that occur on a timescale faster than this exposure time. However, the timescales of the plasmid and ParA-GFP dynamics are on the order of tens of seconds or longer and it is therefore unlikely that any significant asymmetry is being missed by our measurements.</p>
<p>When we examined our whole distribution of cells exhibiting single plasmid <italic>tetO-</italic>TetR-mCherry foci, we found that the degree of ParA-GFP asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5A,B</xref>) was low in comparison with the well-established MinD spatiotemporal oscillator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sliusarenko1">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, the ParA-GFP asymmetry did not correlate with cell length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s005">S5A Fig.</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.08), unlike the case of MinD-YFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sliusarenko1">[27]</xref>. We also compared the ParA-GFP asymmetry to the Hoechst signal. This DNA stain labels the nucleoid itself, which is relatively uniform along the long cell axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Fisher1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-HadizadehYazdi1">[30]</xref>. Here, any asymmetry is not expected to depend on the plasmid foci positions. The Hoechst asymmetry distribution was indeed concentrated around relatively small values, but was apparently measurable within our approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s005">S5B</xref>). Importantly, we found that the ParA-GFP asymmetry measure had a similarly low value as for the Hoechst case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s005">S5B</xref>, no significant difference, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), and that for both the asymmetry is uncorrelated to the plasmid focus position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s005">S5C Fig.</xref>). We therefore conclude that for a single plasmid focus, ParA-GFP typically resides on both sides of a plasmid, with relatively little asymmetry or oscillation, as predicted by the directed motion model, irrespective of a weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) or strong (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s005">S5B Fig.</xref>) degree of polymerization.</p>

<p>Previous analyses had focused on plasmids migrating in the wake of retracting ParA-GFP structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>. Such events can transiently give rise to relatively high ParA-GFP asymmetries (see, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">5C</xref>). Accordingly, we conclude that ParA asymmetry or oscillations are not continuously required for <italic>par2</italic> mediated plasmid positioning. Transient asymmetry, including oscillations, instead likely arises from the dynamics needed to bring about equal plasmid spacing following a spatial perturbation or plasmid duplication event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Once the ParA distribution has returned to being relatively symmetric, this coincides with an equally spaced plasmid configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Such dynamics can be seen in our model simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g004">Figs. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s004">S4B</xref>): asymmetric during plasmid segregation events, but relatively symmetric otherwise. This analysis can therefore accommodate both our findings of a relatively symmetric ParA distribution with previous reports emphasizing asymmetry and oscillations. Overall, our finding of predominantly symmetric, non-oscillatory ParA dynamics may help to reconcile similar findings for ParA in other plasmid partitioning systems, such as for plasmid P1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sengupta1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Hatano1">[16]</xref>.</p>

<title>ParA-GFP forms structures within the nucleoid region</title>
<p>One required feature to achieve equal plasmid spacing is that the ParA-ATP should be organized in a 1d-like structure along the nucleoid as concluded above. However, it is unclear why ParA-ATP on either side of a plasmid would align in a coherent 1d-like structure with their ends coinciding with a plasmid. One potential explanation for this 1d-like behavior is that the ParA-ATP structures are sensitive to the overall nucleoid architecture. To test these features, we examined the localization of ParA-GFP and Hoechst signal simultaneously using optical sectioning in WT cells (n = 678) without <italic>par2-</italic>carrying plasmids to prevent dynamic ParA-GFP structure disassembly. ParA-GFP intensity correlated well with the DNA stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g006">Fig. 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6A</xref>, Pearson's correlation coefficient r<sub>P</sub> = 0.81), indicating that ParA-GFP localization was indeed dependent on the underlying nucleoid. Importantly, ParA-GFP overlaid more with Hoechst than the reverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating that ParA forms structures within the nucleoid region rather than uniformly covering the nucleoid. Although the resolution of our techniques does not allow identification of potential individual ParA polymers, in many cases we did observe extended 1d-like ParA-GFP structures on the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6A</xref>).

<title>Equal plasmid spacing is compromised in cells with a perturbed nucleoid</title>
<p>We reasoned that if ParA structures are reliant on the nucleoid morphology for their organization, then mutants/treatments that perturb the overall nucleoid structure should also exhibit alterations in ParA localization and therefore plasmid focus positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).

<p>To provide evidence that the above deterioration in plasmid positioning arose from an altered ParA distribution, we systematically examined localization of ParA-GFP and Hoechst stain simultaneously in Nal-treated cells (n = 862), which had the largest visible perturbations. We were able to quantify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6B</xref>, p&lt;10<sup>−149</sup>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) perturbations in nucleoid structure that were detectable by eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6A</xref>). Moreover, visual inspection showed that the ParA-GFP distribution followed the nucleoid structure less closely than in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6A</xref>). This finding was quantitatively confirmed by a correlation coefficient of r<sub>P</sub> = 0.68, decreased from its WT value of 0.81 (p&lt;10<sup>−34</sup>), and also by a decrease in the ParA-GFP overlap coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). Altogether, these findings support our hypothesis that the nucleoid provides a template for 1d-like ParA-ATP structure formation, which is partially compromised when the nucleoid structure is perturbed.</p>
<p>To reproduce this behavior in the directed motion model, we assumed that mobile DNA-bound ParA-ATP could now diffuse past a plasmid (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).

<p>We found that ParA-ATP nucleoid-binding, followed by diffusion over the nucleoid, and subsequent ParB-<italic>parC</italic>-stimulated ParA unbinding in a 1d model, is sufficient to generate dynamic ParA-ATP concentration gradients on either side of a plasmid. We have further shown that these ParA concentrations on either side of a plasmid are only symmetric in the case of equally spaced plasmids; unequally-spaced plasmid configurations will cause the ParA gradient to be steeper on one side rather than the other. Fundamentally, this asymmetry arises from two key properties: (i) a greater space for binding of ParA on one side as opposed to the other in unequally-spaced configurations, and (ii) ParA only being returned to the cytoplasm at discrete plasmid positions occupied by ParB-<italic>parC</italic>. The combination of these two features leads to the ParA density being increased in larger versus smaller inter-plasmid regions and hence to asymmetric ParA concentrations in unequally spaced plasmid configurations. According to our analysis, all that is then required for equal plasmid spacing is that the plasmids have a means to preferentially move up the locally steepest ParA concentration gradient and thus locate the equally spaced configuration with symmetric, competitive ParA concentrations around each plasmid. The exact means of plasmid translocation is therefore not critical; all that is important is that such movement can occur.</p>
<p>With this general framework established, we then investigated which specific means of plasmid movement up a concentration gradient were possible, and which was implemented for the <italic>par2</italic> segregation system. We first developed a diffusion/immobilization model and found that such a model could indeed lead to plasmid movement up a ParA gradient, as the plasmid tends to become trapped in regions of higher ParA concentration. However, when we tested this model experimentally, its predictions did not verify: in particular, plasmid mobility was higher in the presence rather than the absence of <italic>par2</italic>, and overall free plasmid mobility was too low to allow the experimentally-observed rapid plasmid segregation following duplication events. This intrinsically low mobility agrees with earlier measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Parry1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Polka1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Derman1">[38]</xref> and is likely a general feature for relatively large intracellular components, given the glass-like properties of the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Parry1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>We then considered active means of ParA-mediated plasmid movement. In particular, we assumed that ParA-ATP could form polymeric filaments, which could subsequently depolymerize through the action of plasmid-associated ParB-<italic>parC</italic>. In this case, ParA-ATP could bind to the nucleoid, diffuse and then subsequently polymerize to form gradients of ParA polymers, with the degree of polymerization influenced by the overall ParA concentration at a particular location. We found that ParA polymer models could naturally explain enhanced plasmid mobility in the presence of <italic>par2</italic>, as well as rapid plasmid segregation events, much more satisfactorily than the diffusion-immobilization model, regardless of whether long or short ParA polymers were formed. This finding in particular shows that our directed motion model is sufficiently general to explain equal plasmid spacing as found in various <italic>parABC</italic> systems with different extents of ParA polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Vecchiarelli2">[18]</xref>. In addition, we note that this mechanism does not critically depend on ParA-ATP binding to the nucleoid as a dimer. A scenario where ParA polymerizes to a certain extent cytoplasmically, and subsequently binds and diffuses on the nucleoid before polymerizing further into immobile filaments, could also suffice.</p>
<p>A key aspect of our models is competition between ParA structures on either side of a plasmid to direct plasmid movement. Therefore our model predicts a comparatively symmetric ParA distribution on average, a prediction which we experimentally verified. We note here that such competition makes the system dynamics robust to alterations in ParA expression levels, since it is only the relative rather than absolute ParA levels on either side of a plasmid that are critical. This analysis potentially explains why cells with variable amounts of ParA-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s001">S1C Fig.</xref>), still possess functional segregation systems with low plasmid loss rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the above polymer models, the movement of a plasmid is assumed to be directed by retracting ParA structures. The precise nature of this short-ranged directed motion is not specified by our analysis, and could include locally biased plasmid diffusion along a retracting polymer in a “burnt-bridge” mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ptacin1">[4]</xref> or even direct pulling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Banigan1">[39]</xref>. This arbitrariness is a special case of our more general result that the mechanism by which a plasmid is able to move up a ParA concentration gradient is not important, only that such movement is possible. Other mechanisms of directed motion are also plausible. One possibility is that ParA-ATP does not polymerize at all, but nevertheless forms dense structures on the nucleoid with many ParA-ATP contacting a plasmid at any given time. In this variant, biased diffusion through an analog of a “burnt-bridge” mechanism is still possible. Another possibility is a DNA-relay, where directed motion is generated by the elastic dynamics of the nucleoid DNA to which ParA-ATP dimers are bound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Lim1">[21]</xref>. Moreover, plasmid diffusion seems not always required for directed plasmid movement. Brownian dynamics simulations based on ParB-<italic>parC</italic>-mediated disassembling ParA polymer bundles can both tether and pull plasmids simultaneously without the need for plasmid diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Banigan1">[39]</xref>. We propose that distinct underlying translocation mechanisms, as exemplified above, could be responsible for directed motion in different <italic>parABC</italic> systems and yet still attain similar equal plasmid spacing.</p>
<p>For our models to generate equal plasmid spacing, ParA should be organized into a 1d-like configuration along the nucleoid. If ParA were not organized in this way, it would be possible for ParA to diffuse around the sides of a plasmid without encountering the hydrolyzing effect of the ParB-<italic>parC</italic> complex. This would equalize the ParA concentrations on both sides even in the case of asymmetrically placed plasmids, leading to failure of the equal spacing mechanism. Potentially such ParA structures could consist of long ParA polymer bundles, or an extended region containing short ParA polymers or dimers. Importantly, in this work, we have provided experimental evidence for such ParA structure formation within the nucleoid region. Interestingly, it has been reported that the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome adopts a helical shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Fisher1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-HadizadehYazdi1">[30]</xref>. Potentially the ParA structures could be preferentially located within a "valley" in this configuration, thereby naturally generating a 1d-like appearance, even for dimers or short polymers. Consistent with these concepts, we found experimentally that plasmid positioning is compromised in nucleoid perturbed strains. ParA structures could also provide a high enough ParA concentration to ensure plasmid tethering and directed plasmid motion, whilst preventing plasmids from diffusing away from the nucleoid, a process which would compromise regular positioning. Further investigation of the exact involvement of the nucleoid in intracellular cargo positioning is therefore an important future goal.</p>

<p>We varied the exact number of ParA-ATP molecules forming a complex that are required to completely immobilize the plasmid and this variation does not alter the qualitative behavior of the system. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of a low spontaneous ParA-ATP hydrolysis parameter k<sub>off</sub> also does not alter the behaviour of the system. We do not keep track of the spatial positions of ParA-ADP and ParA-ATP in the cytoplasm. Instead we merely keep track of their number.</p>
<p>The ParA concentration is assumed to be constant throughout the cell cycle, consistent with the total ParA-GFP fluorescence as a function of cell volume when expressed from an inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s001">S1C Fig.</xref>). In accordance with estimates for average ParA copy numbers obtained by semi-quantitative Western blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s001">S1B Fig.</xref>), the ParA concentration is assumed to be 2400 ParA (dimers) per µm of nucleoid. Simulations start at time t = 0 and run until time t, updated according to the Gillespie algorithm, exceeds a predefined time T. To simulate nucleoid growth during the cell cycle the nucleoid lattice is extended by two sites of size dx (not containing any ParA or plasmids), at one randomly chosen position along the nucleoid length. Such a growth event occurs at regular time intervals. Reaction propensities are then updated in accordance with the new state.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> the nucleoid grows from 1.5 µm to 3 µm in T = 40 min, reflecting one cell cycle. Initially a quarter of the total ParA in the system is in the cytoplasmic ParA-ADP form, 11 ParA-ATP are bound to each plasmid to ensure initial anchoring, and the rest are bound randomly to the nucleoid. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> the plasmid is initially located at site 0.

At regular time intervals of 5 s the simulation state is output along with the plasmid positions to generate a time-averaged probability distribution for the plasmid positions along the long axis of the cell. In cases where the total number of plasmids (n<sub>p</sub>) is more than one, the plasmids are ordered and labeled 1…n<sub>p</sub> according to their positions (by increasing site number) along the nucleoid.

<p>In the event of plasmid duplication at a particular site where an existing plasmid is located, a new plasmid without any bound ParA is added to the same site and the reaction propensities are updated accordingly. In case of two or more existing plasmids, one is chosen randomly for duplication. Plasmid duplication events in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> occur at regular time intervals T/3, although the model behaves equally well with duplication at any time as it dynamically segregates the plasmids to equally spaced positions.</p>

<p>In the perturbed-nucleoid simulations, mobile ParA-ATP can diffuse past a plasmid with 10% (short) or 100% (long) of the normal diffusion rate and the short axis length of the nucleoid is altered to 10 nm in the long polymer model.

<p>As for the diffusion/immobilization model, the total ParA concentration was constrained to be 2400 ParA (dimers) per µm of nucleoid (long axis) and the total length of simulated time was T = 40 min.

Initial plasmid positioning, state output, plasmid position distribution generation and plasmid duplication rules were also as described previously. Nucleoid growth was implemented as described previously, with one generalization: a position along the long axis of the nucleoid was first chosen randomly.

This was due to difficulties in distinguishing between multiple foci due to merging/splitting events, out of focus plane movement and photobleaching when acquiring images using a time interval of 30 s. These effects could have resulted in biases in the analysis due to labelling errors. We were unable to lower the time interval and simultaneously image for long time periods due to TetR-mCherry photobleaching.</p>

Squaring and averaging over many plasmid trajectories results in an MSD: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The last term vanishes due to averaging, but the second term remains and generates a small time independent value for τ&gt;0. Even at short timescales of up to a minute, the MSD has a nonlinear shape, as has been reported before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Polka1">[26]</xref>. This is fully consistent with subdiffusive motion on these timescales. We thus expect the experimentally observed planar MSD for free particle subdiffusion in three dimensions to have the form: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We carefully measured the <italic>par<sup>-</sup></italic> MSD up to 1 min with short time intervals between measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). We performed a nonlinear least squares fit (weighted by the standard error of the mean (SEM): 1/SEM(τ)) for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resulting in the values α = 0.78±0.04, D = 6.8±1.2×10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−α</sup>, β = 6±1×10<sup>−3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p-values: 4×10<sup>−10</sup>, 1×10<sup>−4</sup> and 8×10<sup>−4</sup> respectively). On longer timescales up to 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), plasmid mobility also showed subdiffusive behaviour with a similar analysis giving α = 0.78±0.05, D = 6.2±2.1×10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−α</sup>, β = 4±1×10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p-values: 8×10<sup>−15</sup>, 8×10<sup>−3</sup> and 2×10<sup>−3</sup> respectively). Analysing the two datasets combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) also generated consistent results, although the constant β was not significantly different from zero in this case: α = 0.73±0.02, D = 9.7±1.3×10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−α</sup>, β = 1.6±2.4×10<sup>−3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>, (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p-values: 8×10<sup>−15</sup>, 8×10<sup>−3</sup> and 0.50 respectively, fit shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Fitting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> instead to this combined data set did not alter our estimates for α and D significantly.

<title>Determining plasmid foci positions</title>
<p>Cell outlines and linear projections of ParB-GFP and Hoechst signal distributions along their long axis were determined as described above using MicrobeTracker (MT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sliusarenko1">[27]</xref>. ParB-GFP foci detection of snapshots was also performed using the methods described above. The positions of the half-maxima of the linear Hoechst signal distribution in every cell were then determined. We defined the nucleoid length as the length between the two half-maxima of the Hoechst stain. This analysis allowed us to determine the positions of plasmid foci with respect to the nucleoid.</p>

<title>ParA asymmetry analysis</title>
<p>Here, we summed 6 planes that are in focus from a Z-stack of ParA-GFP fluorescence signal images (dz = 0.2 µm), although the results are not different when using the ParA-GFP signal obtained from single confocal planes focused at mid-cell. Cell outlines, linear projections of ParA-GFP, <italic>tetO-</italic>TetR-mCherry and Hoechst stain fluorescence signal distributions, and <italic>tetO-</italic>TetR-mCherry foci positions were determined as described above. We confirmed that positioning of the <italic>tetO</italic>-TetR-mCherry foci from this dataset was similar to that measured previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>. In cells containing one plasmid focus (n = 134), the ParA-GFP fluorescence signal from pole to plasmid position was summed and divided by the respective pole-to-plasmid distance. This generates two ParA-GFP fluorescence densities I<sub>L</sub> and I<sub>R</sub> for either side extending to the two cell poles. This allows us to compute the normalized ParA asymmetry measure |I<sub>L</sub>-I<sub>R</sub>|/|I<sub>L</sub>+I<sub>R</sub>|. Irrespective of the plasmid position, a completely uniform fluorescence distribution would give an asymmetry value of zero. On the other hand, if all the ParA-GFP was located on one side of the plasmid the asymmetry measure would be one. Using a single confocal plane focused at mid-cell, we also computed the Hoechst asymmetry measure with respect to the plasmid position in the same manner.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sliusarenko1">[27]</xref> by using the same MT software package for analysis, the MinD-YFP asymmetry measure with respect to mid-cell follows an approximate sinusoidal oscillation over time, with a cell-length-dependent oscillation amplitude. In large cells the MinD-YFP oscillations are clearest with an amplitude <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of around 0.6. To generate an asymmetry measure appropriate for the MinD-YFP oscillations, we sampled 10<sup>3</sup> time points t uniformly in [0,2π] (which constitutes one period). We then computed for every time point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The resulting asymmetry distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) therefore reflects the experimental MinD-YFP asymmetry with respect to mid-cell in large cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Sliusarenko1">[27]</xref>. In this way, we can directly compare the asymmetry present in the ParA-GFP and Hoechst signal distributions with that induced by the spatiotemporal oscillations of MinD-YFP. We also generated asymmetry measures using our directed motion model. In simulation outcomes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> (directed motion model with short polymers) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s004">S4B</xref> (directed motion model with long polymers), the plasmid position, cytoplasmic ParA-ADP, cytoplasmic ParA-ATP, nucleoid-bound mobile ParA-ATP and polymeric ParA-ATP levels on either side of the plasmid were output at regular time intervals of dt = 5 s during a time period prior to plasmid duplication (first 2 min and 1.5 min of simulated time for directed motion model with short and long polymers respectively). Cytoplasmic ParA was assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the cell (independently of the plasmid position), thus effectively only contributing to the denominator |<italic>I<sub>L</sub> + I<sub>R</sub></italic>|. With this information we computed the ParA asymmetry using the same method as described for the experimental data. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> (short polymers) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s005">S5B Fig.</xref> (long polymers). It should be noted that according to both models, the ParA asymmetry remains very low once a plasmid is stably positioned at mid-cell, pushing the asymmetry distribution further towards zero over time. This is consistent with time lapses where stable equally spaced plasmid foci positioning correlates with ParA-GFP on either side of a plasmid focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g005">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Ringgaard1">[9]</xref>).</p>

<title>Three dimensional nucleoid and ParA structure analysis</title>
<p>To compare the extent of overlay and 3D structure of Hoechst (nucleoid DNA) stain and ParA-GFP, we first had to align the Z-stack pairs in an unbiased manner. To achieve this, one phase contrast (PC) image (at mid z height) of the Hoechst signal sections was aligned with one GFP section PC image (at the same z position) using the TurboReg ImageJ plugin (option: translation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Thevenaz1">[41]</xref>, after cropping both PC images to match the output size of the deconvolved Z-stacks. Using the same translation as for the Hoechst PC image, Hoechst Z-stacks were then translated in ImageJ to align them with the ParA-GFP Z-stacks.</p>
<p>We determined cell outlines in MT as described above using the PC image acquired with the GFP channel and excluded cells that did not show visible ParA-GFP and Hoechst stain simultaneously. We then computed the linear distributions (for every z height) along the long cell axis for the deconvolved Hoechst and ParA-GFP Z-stacks. We next determined for the ParA-GFP and Hoechst signals separately in every cell the maximal intensity value in the whole cell (I<sub>maxcell</sub>) and the maximal values at every z height (I<sub>max</sub>(z)). To find the 9 z planes from the Z-stacks (dz = 0.1 µm) that are in-focus for each cell in an automated fashion, we summed I<sub>max</sub>(z) over 9 consecutive z positions including a given starting plane and determined the starting plane that gave the largest associated summed value. This starting plane and its 8 consecutive planes formed the in focus plane set. We verified that this method generated the right focus planes by inspecting the chosen planes visually for several cells. This method circumvents the problem of different focus planes for cells on the same image stack as well as alignment inaccuracies in the z direction between ParA-GFP and Hoechst signals which are difficult to control for manually.</p>
<p>Visual comparison of the nucleoid shape between WT and nalidixic acid (Nal) treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g006">Fig. 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6A</xref>) revealed clear differences. In Nal-treated cells, the nucleoid signals, where present inside a cell, were more uniform along the long cell axis than in the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6A,B Fig.</xref>). Shape differences were also visible in the raw Z-stacks suggesting they were not artefacts of the deconvolution method. To quantify these shape differences in an unbiased and systematic manner, we performed the following analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s006">S6B Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>We reasoned that a more uniform pattern would result in a profile along the long axis that resembled a first harmonic (first non-constant term of a Fourier expansion) between the nucleoid edges. Such a harmonic would not fit so well to a more spatially oscillating pattern that would arise, for example, from helical structures. Using the Hoechst stain I<sub>maxcell</sub> and the I<sub>max</sub>(z) arising from the 9 relevant focus planes we determined the half-maximum intensity locations along the long cell axis closest to the cell poles x<sub>L</sub> and x<sub>R</sub> at every z height. At every focus plane z height we could now define the ‘first harmonic’ function defined for x<sub>L</sub>≤x≤x<sub>R</sub>:</p>
<p><disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e155"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>.</p>
<p>For every (x,z) we calculated the squared error SE(x,z) between the actual intensity value I(x,z) and H(x,z): <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Lastly we summed over the SEs at every (x,z) and divided by the number of position points (x,z) to obtain a single measure of deviation SE<sub>cell</sub> in a cell that is independent of the number of data points (and thus nucleoid size) and expression level variation between cells (because of normalization to I<sub>maxcell</sub>). We then performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test on the set of SE<sub>cell</sub> comparing a population of WT cells with nucleoid-perturbed cells (n<sub>WT</sub> = 678 and n<sub>Nal</sub> = 862). Nucleoid shapes in Nal-treated cells were indeed altered (p&lt;10<sup>-149</sup>). Note that this method did not detect a notable shape change in <italic>matP</italic> cells (n<italic><sub>matP</sub></italic> = 579), potentially due to our techniques not being sufficiently sensitive.</p>
<p>To quantitate the colocalization of ParA-GFP and Hoechst signal in each cell, we also calculated, for every cell, the Pearson's correlation coefficient r<sub>P</sub> using all the intensity values I<sub>ParA-GFP</sub>(x,z) and I<sub>Hoechst</sub>(x,z) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Manders1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>To determine the fraction of ParA-GFP intensity signal that overlaps with Hoechst signal and vice versa we computed Manders overlap coefficients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004009-Manders1">[42]</xref>. This method requires a choice of threshold T<sub>Manders</sub> to distinguish between positions (x,z) that are considered to contain or lack sufficient intensity signal. We therefore performed our analyses for the complete range of threshold values to show that our qualitative conclusions are insensitive to the choice of a particular T<sub>Manders</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g007">7C</xref>). Manders overlap coefficients of ParA-GFP and Hoechst were calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e157"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>with <disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e158"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Likewise the Manders overlap coefficient of Hoechst onto ParA-GFP is defined as:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e159"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>with<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004009.e160"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004009.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Note that taking T<sub>Manders</sub> = 0, will generate an overlap coefficient of one by construction. The normalization to I<sub>maxcell</sub> in determining the colocalizing positions allows the overlap coefficients to be comparable between cells.</p>
<p>In a small fraction of cells the alignment procedure described above did not result in proper alignment. This is clearly reflected in the r<sub>P</sub> values being considerably lower for these cases than for the cell population mean r<sub>P</sub> value. However, without excluding these few, possibly false negative, cases the population mean r<sub>P</sub> value is still high (0.81 and 0.68 for WT and Nal-treated cells respectively), indicating that ParA-GFP and Hoechst signals generally correlate strongly at a population level. Poor alignment affects Manders overlap coefficients for the ParA-GFP and Hoechst signals on average equally and is not biased towards a particular strain/treatment. Therefore the observed misalignment of a small fraction of cells does not affect the qualitative conclusions that we state in this study.</p>
<p>Note that in <italic>matP</italic> cells, we did not observe any significant alteration in intensity correlation (r<sub>P</sub> = 0.80 for <italic>matP</italic>), nor ParA-GFP overlap coefficient, as compared to the WT. This result was expected given that we could not detect any significant nucleoid structure alteration, as described above.</p>

(<bold>E</bold>) Histograms of 10<sup>5</sup> datasets for each of n<sub>p</sub> = 1–4, where for each dataset plasmids are positioned in [0,100] with a uniform distribution, independent from each other and consequently labeled 1..n<sub>p</sub> according to their position. This protocol induces an inherent spatial ordering. By comparing these distributions with the WT experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004009-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> (n<sub>p</sub> = 1,2) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004009.s002">S2B Fig.</xref> (n<sub>p</sub> = 3,4) it is clear that the <italic>parABC</italic> system positions plasmid foci much more precisely, although the effect of active positioning becomes less clear as n<sub>p</sub> increases. (<bold>F</bold>) Time-averaged plasmid position distributions for directed motion model with short and long polymers for n<sub>p</sub> = 3–4 (short) and n<sub>p</sub> = 1–4 (long) on simulated growing nucleoids without plasmid duplication. Results obtained from 124 independent simulations, where ParA-ATP could now diffuse past a plasmid (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
