<abstract>
<p>Pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Listeria</italic> and <italic>Yersinia</italic> gain initial entry by binding to host target cells and stimulating their internalization. Bacterial uptake entails successive, increasingly strong associations between receptors on the surface of bacteria and hosts. Even with genetically identical cells grown in the same environment, there are vast differences in the number of bacteria entering any given cell. To gain insight into this variability, we examined uptake dynamics of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> engineered to express the invasin surface receptor from <italic>Yersinia</italic>, which enables uptake via mammalian host β<sub>1</sub>-integrins. Surprisingly, we found that the uptake probability of a single bacterium follows a simple power-law dependence on the concentration of integrins. Furthermore, the value of a power-law parameter depends on the particular host-bacterium pair but not on bacterial concentration. This power-law captures the complex, variable processes underlying bacterial invasion while also enabling differentiation of cell lines.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Uptake of bacteria by mammalian cells is highly variable within a population of host cells and between host cell types. A detailed but unwieldy mechanistic model describing individual host-pathogen receptor binding events is captured by a simple power-law dependence on the concentration of the host receptors. The power-law parameters capture characteristics of the host-bacterium pair interaction and can differentiate host cell lines. This study has important implications for understanding the accuracy and precision of therapeutics employing receptor-mediated transport of materials to mammalian hosts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> exploit a latent phagocytic activity in gut epithelia to pass into deeper tissues that are optimal for survival and proliferation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Particularly well studied is the 'zipper' phagocytic process used by <italic>Yersinia</italic>: Envelopment of a bacterium by a host membrane is aided by successive binding events between bacterial surface receptors called invasins and cognate β<sub>1</sub>-integrins exposed on the surface of host intestinal multifold cells (M-cells) in the gut lumen [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Zipper-mediated phagocytosis can be broken down into three successive steps: The first step is contact and adherence; second is phagocytic cup formation; and the final stage is phagocytic cup closure. Contact does not require active alterations to host actin cytoskeleton but rather hinges on strong associations between bacterial receptors and host ligands. In contrast, the creation and resolution of the phagocytic cup is a dynamic process involving numerous signal transduction and structural genes coordinated in receptor clustering, membrane phospholipid redistribution, and cytoskeletal re-organization [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). A particularly critical aspect is the high affinity of invasin for β<sub>1</sub>-integrins, which promotes phagocytosis by increasing cell-surface adhesion [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and outcompetes extracellular matrix proteins for enough host integrins [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] to sustain bacterial engulfment.</p>
<p>A striking observation emerging from these studies is the cell-cell variability in bacterial uptake: Isogenic host cells cultivated under the same conditions show differences in the number of bacteria that will invade. Past studies have reported that this variability manifests as bimodal uptake dynamics, where a fraction of mammalian cells take up bacteria while the other fraction is devoid of bacteria [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This property is not limited to cultured experiments since <italic>Yersinia</italic> introduced into the intestines of mice are often found in islands of M-cells surrounded by bacteria-free regions and that the number of bacteria in infected cells spans a wide range [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Such differences may arise from the stochastic nature of cellular interactions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Also, the uptake may have resulted from pre-existing, long-lived differences in host cell properties (e.g. cell surface, signal transduction network, cytoskeleton) that have stochastic [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and deterministic [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] origins.</p>
<p>The complexity in bacterial uptake presents a challenge for explaining variability. Here, to characterize the fundamental property of bacterial uptake, we employ kinetic modeling and experiments that distill a simple power-law, relating uptake probability—the amount of bacteria per host cell scaled by the bacteria concentration—with host receptor levels. Our study demonstrates that a simplified model of successive binding events that occur in the zipper mechanism is sufficient to generate an ultrasensitive, threshold-dependent response to host receptors. Thus, minute cell-cell differences in host receptors are amplified into large differences in uptake. We describe how different hosts and bacterial strains translate into different power-law parameters which serves as the basis of a novel, <italic>operational</italic> definition of cell type.</p>

<title>Variability in invasin-mediated bacterial uptake</title>
<p>We modified a previous cell culture protocol to measure bacterial uptake by HeLa human cervical cancer-derived cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In particular, we engineered non-pathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to express invasin from <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (Materials and Methods). Invasin-mediated bacterial entry via binding with b1-integrins is one of the best-studied zipper-mechanism systems and has been used in a number of biological and potential clinical applications [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Remarkably, binding of invasins to mammalian host receptors is sufficient to facilitate entry into non-phagocytic mammalian cells. In fact, non-pathogenic bacteria expressing invasins [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or even beads coated with invasins [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] can enter into mammalian host cells. Thus, the entry dynamics of this engineered bacterial system can be attributed to the interactions between invasin and host receptors. To track and quantify uptake in individual hosts, we engineered <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to constitutively express a green fluorescent protein (GFP). In each experiment, the engineered bacteria were co-cultured with HeLa cells for 90 minutes in well-mixed conditions to mitigate the effects of heterogeneity in the bacterial population. In addition, the mixture was co-incubated in the presence of sub-lethal gentamicin before washing and measurement (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). This gentamicin treatment served two purposes by inhibiting bacterial growth: First, it reduced differences between bacterial numbers and our calculation of MOI that could arise during co-culture. Second, it minimized alterations in GFP signals due to bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Consistent with observations reported in the literature [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], fluorescence microscopy confirmed drastic cell-cell variability in bacterial uptake by HeLa cells (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Some cells were devoid of bacteria, whereas the others each contained a wide range. This property was consistent with flow cytometry measurements (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>): At intermediate bacterial concentrations, a bimodal distribution of GFP fluorescence arises where within a single population there exist both uninfected cells (i.e. low mode) and infected cells (i.e. high mode). Even within the infected subpopulation, there was drastic variability in fluorescence, indicating a wide range of bacterial numbers in individual cells. We note that the characteristics of bacterial uptake depended on the bacterial multiplicity of infection (MOI) as well as the host cell type (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Uptake in all the cell lines we tested, most of which are cancer models, was positively correlated with MOI but the amount of uptake was quite variable.</p>

<p>Bacterial uptake variability within an infected population of cells has been speculated to arise from cell-cell variability in host surface membrane properties [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A trivial explanation is that variability in uptake reflects a wide, bimodal distribution of host β<sub>1</sub>-integrins or GFP signals in bacteria. However, immunolabeling experiments revealed a relatively narrow, unimodal distribution of β<sub>1</sub>-integrins across HeLa cells (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>). Similarly, GFP signals in bacteria showed a tight and unimodal distribution (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Hence, we hypothesized that the dynamics arising from zipper-like interactions may be responsible for generating the observed bimodal uptake from a unimodal β<sub>1</sub>-integrin distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>A model of zipper-mediated bacterial uptake</title>
<p>To examine the mechanistic basis of the variable bacterial uptake, we developed a kinetic model consisting of a set of ordinary differential equations that capture two important aspects of the zipper mechanism (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, supporting text (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>) and tables (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>) Tables). First, invasin-integrin interactions are inherently cooperative [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as sequential binding events are increasingly likely due to host-pathogen proximity and the stabilizing role of invasin-integrin clustering [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Second, bacteria must maintain a minimum number of invasin-integrin interactions to remain stably attached to host cells.</p>

<p>We make the simplifying assumption that bacteria and β<sub>1</sub>-integrins interact as if they were in a homogeneous, well-mixed system. Furthermore, rather than explicitly describing every single receptor binding event, we divide the uptake process into three reversible stages (i.e. the 3-stage model). Initially, bacteria bind weakly to a small number of β<sub>1</sub>-integrins (state B<sub>1</sub>) and these initial interactions increase the avidity of subsequent binding events. In the second stage, weakly-bound bacteria can adhere in a more stable fashion by interacting with an intermediate number of β<sub>1</sub>-integrins (state B<sub>m</sub>), which we assume is sufficient for successful adherence even after repeated washing. In the final stage, a maximal number of β<sub>1</sub>-integrin interactions can be formed (state B<sub>n</sub>), representing the saturation of invasin receptors and a state that corresponds to bacterial engulfment and internalization [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, we define bacterial uptake in this study is as the sum of bacteria achieving at least the intermediate binding state (i.e. sum of B<sub>m</sub> and B<sub>n</sub>) to represent both stably-adhered and internalized bacteria. In fact, immunostaining of a single infected host cell with anti-LPS shows both stably-adhered and fully internalized bacteria (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). We note that the number of β<sub>1</sub>-interactions depend on the amount of invasins expressed in bacteria cells, with successful adherence and internalization likely requiring a large number of interactions. Thus, rather than modeling each binding event explicitly to match experimental data, our goals with the 3-stage and the full model are to explore the conceptual basis for the experimentally observed variability in bacterial uptake. Indeed, the qualitative behaviors of our full model, in which each binding step is explicitly modeled, are not especially dependent upon the nominal values of intermediate (m = 10) or maximal number (n = 100) of interactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>A power-law summarizes uptake dependence on host receptors</title>
<p>Consistent with experimental measurements, our model predicts that both the mean uptake per cell and the fraction of the population infected increase with the bacterial MOI (Figs <xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A</xref>). Simulation results show that these behaviors arise from a threshold relationship between uptake and host receptor number. In particular, host cells with fewer than threshold numbers of receptors do not take up bacteria; above a threshold, uptake is positively correlated with the number of host receptors. Since we assume a bi-molecular binding reaction between bacteria and mammalian receptors for the initial binding step, a higher bacterial concentration would require a lower mammalian receptor concentration to enable bacterial uptake. Thus, bacterial concentration modulates overall uptake while reducing the minimal threshold of host receptors. For example, uptake only occurs in cells with more than 6∙10<sup>5</sup> β<sub>1</sub>-integrins at 25 MOI (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>; dark green) whereas only 1∙10<sup>5</sup> β<sub>1</sub>-integrins are needed at 1000 MOI (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>; brown).</p>
<p>The threshold response produced by the zipper model indicates a sensitive dependence of bacterial uptake on bacterial concentration. For a given host receptor concentration, our model predicts that the bacterial uptake increases linearly (in log-log scale) with the bacterial concentration (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, inset). This property could be expected as we have assumed independent binding of bacteria to receptors. In other words, from the perspective of a single bacterium, its uptake would solely depend on the host receptor concentration.</p>
<p>Consistent with this notion, when scaled with respect to the corresponding MOI values, the different dose responses in <xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> collapse into a single curve, which is approximately linear (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). This curve summarizes how uptake depends on host receptor number. In essence, increasing bacterial MOI extends the uptake curve into a lower range of host receptor concentrations, as evidenced by a downward shift in the mean. Importantly, the sensitive threshold relationship and unified uptake trajectory were recapitulated by a zipper model explicitly describing all 100 binding/unbinding steps, indicating these behaviors are not specific to the simpler 3-stage model (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The approximately linear relationship between the logarithm of uptake and host receptors indicates the power-law dependence. Indeed, the inset in <xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> show a fit by the equation logP = β·logR—logK<sub>Deff</sub>, where β and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>Deff</italic></sub> are fitted parameters. Sequential perturbation of zipper model parameters shows that these changes can be mapped to changes in both power-law parameters (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>). In particular, changes to the dissociation constants for binding of B and B<sub>1</sub> to receptors had the greatest effect. Altogether this analysis shows that a simple power-law provides a concise summary of zipper-mediated uptake.</p>
<p>How does such a simple dependence arise? Highly cooperative binding processes can often be approximated by the Hill equation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], in which the fraction of particle binding as a function of the log of the input follows a characteristic sigmoidal trajectory. Zipper model simulations reveal that uptake probability as a function of receptor behaves in this characteristic fashion according to P = R<sup>β</sup> / (K<sub>Deff</sub> + R<sup>β</sup>) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). A power-law arises if the receptor concentration is much lower than the effective dissociation constant (i.e. K<sub>Deff</sub> &gt;&gt; R<sup>β</sup>). A large <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>Deff</italic></sub> can arise from the reversible, multi-step nature of uptake that makes achieving the uptake state less likely than if it were a single binding event.</p>

<title>The probability of invasin-mediated uptake is invariant</title>
<p>To test the predicted power-law, we needed to measure, in single host cells, the concentration of β<sub>1</sub>-integrins in addition to the bacterial uptake (as measured by GFP). To this end, we used a non-activating antibody to fluorescently label β<sub>1</sub>-integrins [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

We chose a relatively low concentration of antibody (0.15 μg/mL) that reports the relative amount of receptors on host cells while not having a severe effect on bacterial uptake (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5E Fig</xref>). While antibody-bound receptors may not be directly involved in bacterial uptake, we reasoned that, at a sufficiently low concentration, the antibody-bound receptors may be used as a proxy reporter for the relative amount of β<sub>1</sub>-integrins.</p>

With increasing bacterial MOI, the major axes of GFP+ subpopulations were shifted towards higher GFP levels, consistent with an overall increase in uptake, and towards lower β<sub>1</sub>-integrin levels, indicative of a reduced threshold of receptors required for uptake. When GFP values were scaled with their respective MOI for the fraction of infected host cells, the curves collapsed into a single linear line that has high correlation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), similar to our previous simulation results (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).

<title>Characteristic power-law parameters describe uptake in different cell lines</title>
<p>Our analysis demonstrates that, for a wide range of system parameters, zipper-mediated uptake is captured by a power law. Changes in many kinetic parameters associated with the zipper mechanism can be mapped to changes in the power-law parameters (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>; simulated data in <xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>). In a typical cell, changes in zipper-mechanism parameters reflect the changes in either the bacteria or the host cells. For instance, the initial binding rate (k<sub>fB1</sub>) between bacteria and host cells is affected by factors including expression levels of invasin and β<sub>1</sub>-integrins along with the prevalence of β chain integrins in host cells. For the same bacterial strain, different host cell types would likely lead to different kinetic parameters for the zipper mechanisms, and thus different corresponding power-law parameters.

<p>To test this hypothesis, we measured the uptake dynamics of our engineered bacteria (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressing arabinose-inducible invasin) in several mammalian cell lines, grown under the same condition. In theory, we expect that different uptake probability dose responses would be measured at different bacterial MOI to share a given power-law trajectory. However, measurements done at low MOI values would likely be prone to fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of the interaction between small numbers of bacteria and mammalian cells. This would then lead to greater uncertainty in the estimated power-law parameters.</p>
<p>In fact, our experimental measurements show this property. In particular, we treated several cell lines with increasing MOI. And these measurements showed that the power-law parameter values stabilized with increasing MOI, which likely resulted from more accurate measurement and analysis when more cells were in the GFP+ mode (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8C Fig</xref>). As such, for more extensive analysis of different cell lines, we chose a high MOI for bacterial infection.</p>
<p>Results in <xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> reveal that power-law parameters β and 1/K<sub>Deff</sub> for different cell lines infected with bacteria at 1000 MOI appeared to fall along a single trajectory. This is reminiscent of modeling analysis showing that perturbation to zipper model parameters modulates power-law parameter values along the same, restricted path (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In addition, for each host cell line, β and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>Deff</italic></sub> were lower for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> harboring <italic>pBAC-AraInv</italic> relative to <italic>pSCT7Inv</italic> plasmid, possibly resulting from the lower invasin expression from <italic>pBAC-AraInv</italic> under these conditions.</p>
<p>The approximately linear correlation between <bold>β</bold> and 1/K<sub>Deff</sub> can be understood by examining the equation governing the emergent power-law (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Every set of perturbations results in quasi-parallel lines for a range of specific receptor concentrations, thus enabling the data collapse over several orders of magnitude for biologically relevant values (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). However, as receptor concentration approaches zero, the linear fit breaks down and all lines approach a quasi-constant locus (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A Fig</xref>). Therefore, when examining the correlation between <bold>β</bold> and 1/K<sub>Deff</sub>, we can construct an inverse linear regression fit (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9B Fig</xref>) such that the slope and intercept of this line correspond to the locus of convergence for receptors and for probability uptake.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Zipper-mediated phagocytosis entails coordination of a diverse set of host cellular processes. Bacterial uptake through this mechanism has been found to be highly variable, even within isogenic cells grown under tightly controlled experimental conditions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In general, heterogeneous behaviors have been believed to arise from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and differences in the local microenvironment for each cell, for example, the placement of neighboring cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Phagocytosis is particularly complex as it is affected by quantitative changes in host signal transduction molecules [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], cytoskeletal dynamics [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], particle receptor affinity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], host receptor density, particle size, and shape [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has been suggested that the hundreds of signaling molecules are potentially involved [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The sheer complexity presents a seemingly daunting challenge for attempts to incorporate detailed molecular knowledge into a theoretical model with predictive power [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>We show that, despite the complexity, bacterial uptake by a 'zipper' mechanism can be modeled as sequential binding between bacterial invasin ligands to host receptors. Our detailed, quantitative, single-cell measurements revealed that, in the same population of host cells, the fraction of host cells infected with bacteria increases in a monotonic fashion with the levels of host β<sub>1</sub>-integrins—irrespective of MOI. Likewise, our modeling results demonstrate a positive correlation between invasin-mediated uptake of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and the relative abundance of available β<sub>1</sub>-integrins expressed by hosts.</p>
<p>A counterintuitive, striking notion from our analysis is that uptake may be distilled into a simple empirical relation defined by two lumped parameters. Indeed, phenomenological approaches have been routinely used when detailed description is impractical, for example, oxygen binding [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], gene regulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and bacterial growth [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similarly, power-law relations have a rich history in the description of scale-invariant processes in nature [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Here we show that an ultrasensitive host-pathogen relationship explains a large proportion of the variation in pathogen invasion. Our results demonstrate generation of broad cell-cell variability in bacterial uptake by a Hill-like mechanism involving surface receptor interactions, though other mechanisms can contribute to this variability. For example, there could be a positive feedback in host cell cytoskeletal signaling that determine phagocytosis of bound bacteria.</p>
<p>The emergence of a power-law correlation suggests that microscopic understanding does not necessarily enhance our ability to describe some lumped system behavior [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Though simple, the power-law description of uptake is robust in describing invasin-mediated bacterial uptake by mammalian cells, and the extracted power-law parameters can be useful in distinguishing pairs of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains (expressing varying levels of invasion) and mammalian cell lines. This represents a complementary, simple and efficient means to characterize cell physiology. Each perturbation to the system produces a unique set of power-law parameters; a library of these parameters can be collected for easily accessible sample analysis. Also, this notion can be extended to other pathogens and particles that utilize a multi-step, reversible binding process such as viruses. Similar to bacterial uptake by host cells, viruses also employ receptor-mediated endocytosis to use biological machinery in the host cells for them to replicate [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This behavior plays an important role in viral infections including Influenza and Rubella [<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. By providing simple predictions for multi-step receptor-mediated uptake, the power-law description can enable us to capture cellular dynamics without identifying interconnected processes involved in each step.</p>

The detailed models are described in the supporting text (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>) and tables (<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004203.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables).</p>

<title>Expression of induced GFP.</title>
<p>Flow cytometry data for GFP expression. pBacr-AraInv and pTetGFP plasmids were introduced into Top10F' E. <italic>coli</italic>, enabling the control of Invasin expression through addition of arabinose and control of GFP expression through ATC, respectively. Top10F’ cells containing only pBacr-AraInv were used for control. Cultures were grown overnight at 37°C in LB for 16 hours and sub-cultures were performed with 100-fold dilution from overnight culture. (A) The control strain was grown without arabinose induction for comparison, and Top10F’ containing pBacr-AraInv and pTetGFP was either (B) uninduced, or (C) induced with. 1% arabinose and 100ng/ml ATC to induce Invasin and GFP. The mean expression level of GFP in the induced sample (C) is approximately three magnitudes higher than that measured in the uninduced sample (B). Also, the basal level expression in the cells containing only pBacr-AraInv (A) is also at least two magnitudes smaller than that in the induced sample (C). All three panels in the figure show tight and unimodal distributions of GFP expression.</p>

<p>HeLa cells, infected with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressing invasin and GFP at an MOI of 200 for 90 minutes, were washed with PBS twice, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and immunostained with an anti-LPS antibody to identify bacterial cell wall (red color) and Hoechst to identify DNA (blue color). In the merged image, yellow dots (indicated by white arrows) represent GFP-expressing bacteria that were immunostained in red, suggesting that they are surface-bound. Green dots represent fully internalized bacteria that were prevented from immunostaining by the mammalian cell wall. The presence of both green and yellow bacteria suggests that invasin-expressing bacteria can adhere and invade into mammalian host cells.</p>

<title>Linear correlation of power-law parameters.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) For each parameter, the zipper model simulates several perturbations over two orders of magnitude. This results in quasi-parallel lines consistent with the emergence of the power-law, analogous to that of <xref rid="pcbi.1004203.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>; the spread of the distribution of each set of lines is determined by the model’s sensitivity to each respective parameter.

As the power-law breaks down, each line approximately approaches a common point of convergence (R*, P*). The subset shown above consists of one line chosen from each perturbation.
