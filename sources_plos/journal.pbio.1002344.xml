<abstract>
<p>IgG antibodies can organize into ordered hexamers on cell surfaces after binding their antigen. These hexamers bind the first component of complement C1 inducing complement-dependent target cell killing. Here, we translated this natural concept into a novel technology platform (HexaBody technology) for therapeutic antibody potentiation. We identified mutations that enhanced hexamer formation and complement activation by IgG1 antibodies against a range of targets on cells from hematological and solid tumor indications. IgG1 backbones with preferred mutations E345K or E430G conveyed a strong ability to induce conditional complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of cell lines and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient tumor cells, while retaining regular pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutical developability. Both mutations potently enhanced CDC- and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of a type II CD20 antibody that was ineffective in complement activation, while retaining its ability to induce apoptosis. The identified IgG1 Fc backbones provide a novel platform for the generation of therapeutics with enhanced effector functions that only become activated upon binding to target cell–expressed antigen.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Immunotherapy is a powerful and rapidly expanding field that makes use of the body’s natural defense mechanisms to eliminate disease entities such as infectious agents or cancer cells. Circulating antibodies bind aberrant structures in a highly target-specific manner and “flag” disease cells for destruction by killing machineries that are present in the bloodstream. We recently showed that activation of one of these immune defense mechanisms, the complement system, is most efficiently initiated by binding of the first complement component C1q to a ring of six antibodies. Since antibody hexamerization occurs naturally only after binding to surface antigens, complement activation and subsequent complement-mediated cell killing is therefore restricted to these antibody-flagged cells. Now, with a mutational screening approach, we identified structural entities in the antibody backbone that potentiate this antigen binding–induced hexamer formation. We identified mutations that enhance the hexamer formation and complement activation by IgG1 antibodies against a wide range of targets on varying cancer cells. Based on our findings, we present a broadly applicable platform for the generation of therapeutic antibodies with enhanced ability to promote hexamerization-induced complement activation and target cell killing only after surface antigen binding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Target cells are flagged for destruction by antibodies bound to their cognate antigen on the cell surface. Elimination of antibody-opsonized cells is mediated by the innate immune system. The cellular branch of this system includes NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils that are activated via specific IgG Fc receptors (FcγR) sensing surface-bound IgG antibodies. The molecular branch of innate defense includes the complement system, which consists of an amplifiable cascade of soluble zymogens that are abundant in blood and other extracellular fluids. We recently showed that IgG antibodies organize into ordered hexamers on cell surfaces following antigen binding. These IgG hexamers bind and activate C1, the first component in the classical complement pathway that leads to target cell killing by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) via membrane attack complexes (MACs) that breach the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref001">1</xref>]. In addition, complement activation generates chemoattractants, anaphylatoxins, and opsonins that serve to attract and activate immune effector cells and induce additional killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref002">2</xref>]. In immunotherapy, we leverage these natural defense mechanisms by marking specific target cell populations for elimination by passively administered therapeutic antibodies. These antibodies may be engineered to enhance their ability to activate effector cells or complement. For example, amino acid residues in IgG that affect binding in an FcγR-specific fashion can be modified to promote more efficient antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref005">5</xref>]. C1 binding and CDC may be increased by reshuffling IgG1 and IgG3 or by mutating amino acid positions adjacent to the lower hinge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref011">11</xref>]. In contrast to IgG molecules, IgM antibodies already pre-exist as pentameric or hexameric oligomers that are kept together via covalent bonds. Exposure of the C1 binding site and the activation of complement is regulated via conformational changes upon antigen binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref013">13</xref>]. This concept to enhance complement activation has been exploited by the covalent association of IgG monomers via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in an IgM-derived 18 amino acid carboxyterminal extension and additionally between cysteine residues introduced at position 309 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The ability and potency of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to induce complement activation and CDC is dependent on IgG isotype and on the characteristics of both the antigen (i.e., size, flexibility, and mobility) and the epitope (i.e., accessibility and distance to the membrane). The potential of complement for rapid and effective cell killing, as well as its capacity for attracting and modulating both innate and adaptive cellular immune responses, provide a strong rationale for the development of therapeutic antibodies with optimized complement-activating characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref002">2</xref>]. However, few therapeutic antibodies generated to date induce potent CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref017">17</xref>], and the availability of technologies to facilitate the generation and development of IgG antibodies that are capable of effective complement activation are therefore highly sought after.</p>
<p>We recently demonstrated that the assembly of IgG molecules into hexamers may be enhanced by specific mutations in the Fc domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref001">1</xref>]. Here, we identify two preferred IgG1 backbones, harboring a single amino acid mutation, that strongly enhance Fc-mediated assembly at the cell surface, while retaining all the qualities required for the development of biopharmaceuticals. We demonstrate applicability to a range of targets and cells including hematological and solid tumor indications as well as cell lines and patients’ cells. The conditional nature of the technology provides a novel route for the identification and safe development of potentiated Fc-based immunotherapeutics.</p>

<title>Potentiation of CDC Activity by Increased Hexamerization Is Broadly Applicable</title>
<p>Previously, we showed that antigen-bound IgG molecules organize into hexamers at the cell surface to mediate optimal C1q binding and complement activation. We observed an extensive Fc:Fc interface between IgG molecules, and it was shown that a glutamic acid into arginine (E345R) mutation at this interface enhanced IgG clustering, C1q binding, and CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref001">1</xref>]. To determine whether this observation could be broadly applied, we introduced the E345R mutation in a panel of IgG antibodies targeting different antigens (CD20 [Uniprot P11836], CD52 [P31358], CD38 [P28907], and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] [P00533]) and assessed CDC of cell lines with varying expression of antigen and membrane complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) CD46 (P15529), CD55/DAF (P08174), and CD59 (P13987).</p>
<p>Introduction of the E345R mutation into the chimeric CD20 antibody rituximab (RTX) as well as the human CD20 antibody 11B8 increased lysis of both Wien 133 and Daudi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The difference was particularly apparent for wild-type 11B8, which, as expected for a type II CD20 antibody, did not induce complement-mediated lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Introducing E345R in the CD52 antibody alemtuzumab (ALM) strongly enhanced CDC of both Wien 133 and Raji cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and the mutation also potentiated both the CD38 antibodies IgG1-005 and IgG1-003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Interestingly, antibody 2F8 directed against the solid-tumor antigen EGFR also induced potent CDC when containing E345R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). IgG1-003 and 2F8 represent antibodies that were unable to induce CDC in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref019">19</xref>]. From these data, we conclude that the Fc:Fc interface mutation E345R is able to convert antibodies against a range of targets and epitopes into potent mediators of CDC, even for antibodies that do not induce any complement-mediated lysis as a wild-type IgG1 molecule.</p>

<p>To analyze the impact of target expression, we performed CDC assays using a panel of human tumor cell lines with increasing CD20 expression. Cells were selected for a comparable (intermediate) expression of total mCRPs resulting in increasing CD20:mCRP ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Only highly CD20-overexpressing SU-DHL-4 cells were lysed efficiently by RTX, whereas lower expression resulted in minimal lysis. In contrast, introduction of E345R in RTX yielded strong lysis for all three cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The potential of mCRPs to limit CDC by wild-type and E345R-mutated RTX was assessed with cell lines that express similar levels of the CD20 target antigen and increasing levels of mCRPs, resulting in decreasing CD20:mCRP ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s009">S2 Table</xref>). RTX-E345R demonstrated increased lysis for all cell lines tested, indicating that the mutation reduced sensitivity to mCRP inhibition.</p>

<p>The in vivo efficacy of E345R-potentiated IgG1 antibody 7D8, directed against CD20, was evaluated in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice inoculated subcutaneously with luciferase-expressing Raji cells expressing high numbers of complement defense molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). After the tumor volume reached approximately 40–150 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized at an average tumor volume of 85 mm<sup>3</sup> per group and treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of 50 μg 7D8, 7D8-E345R, 7D8-K322A, or an irrelevant IgG1 isotype control antibody (IgG1-b12). 7D8-K322A contains a mutation that abrogates C1q binding and CDC and was used as an additional control. In agreement with its increased ability to activate complement, only 7D8-E345R showed significant antitumor efficacy. The wild-type 7D8 showed a trend of activity, but did not reach statistical significance compared to controls. Statistical analysis of tumor inhibition was performed on day 22 when all mice in all groups were still in the study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s010">S3 Table</xref>). 7D8-E345R inhibited tumor growth vs control (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0044) and compared to 7D8-K322A (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0474). In addition, in a Kaplan Meier analysis performed until the end of the experiment on day 44 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s010">S3 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), 7D8-E345R significantly inhibited progression as defined by tumors growing &gt; 700 mm<sup>3</sup> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.019), whereas the wild type did not.</p>

<title>Library Screening Demonstrates All Mutations of E345 and E430 Stimulate CDC</title>
<p>To better understand the structural constraints of IgG hexamerization and to identify mutations other than E345R that promote Fc:Fc interactions, we generated an antibody mutant library focused on two regions of interest. Firstly, amino acid substitutions were introduced at, or proximal to, the intermolecular Fc:Fc interface observed in the hexameric crystal packing of human IgG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref020">20</xref>]. Secondly, amino acid substitutions were introduced at the intramolecular C<sub>H</sub>2–C<sub>H</sub>3 interface to alter Fc domain flexibility, which could potentially modulate Fc:Fc interactions allosterically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We employed screening conditions that allowed for the identification of inhibitory and stimulatory mutations. Mutants of CD38 antibody IgG1-005 containing single amino acid mutations were screened with the complement-sensitive cell line Daudi at a concentration that induced maximal lysis for the wild-type antibody to identify inhibitory positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s011">S4 Table</xref>). Stimulatory mutations were screened for using the complement-refractory cell line Wien 133 at a concentration that induced minimal CDC for the wild-type antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s012">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

The consensus IgG interaction site for FcRn, Protein A, and Protein G (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s002">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref021">21</xref>] was found to play a crucial role in the interaction between antibody Fc domains, as exemplified by the abundance of CDC-inhibiting mutations in this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s002">S1B Fig</xref>). The C-terminal β-strand represents another critical region as mutations of all amino acids in the stretch 437–440 inhibited CDC, demonstrating it provides important contacts for an efficient Fc:Fc interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s002">S1C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutations promoting Fc:Fc interactions were relatively sparse and predominantly confined to the periphery of direct Fc:Fc contacts as indicated by the green colored residues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s012">S5 Table</xref>. A selection of the stimulating mutations were separately introduced in RTX and, next to the IgG1-005 mutants, assessed in dose response. This analysis demonstrated that the E345, E430, and S440 mutations that enhanced CDC of Wien 133 cells by IgG1-005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) also consistently stimulated CDC of Ramos cells by RTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) and Daudi cells by IgG1-005 and RTX variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s003">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s013">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s014">S7</xref> Tables).</p>
<p>The observation that all mutations at amino acid positions E345 and E430 stimulate CDC is surprising (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s012">S5 Table</xref>). A close-up of the structure surrounding the E345 Fc:Fc interface residue shows that its side chain is directed towards residue G385 at the terminus of C<sub>H</sub>3 β-strand C of the facing antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), according to the Ig fold nomenclature of Halaby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref022">22</xref>]. Residue E430 forms a salt bridge stabilizing the C<sub>H</sub>2–C<sub>H</sub>3 interface packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Since even conservative mutations into aspartic acid, preserving the negative charge, resulted in enhanced CDC, glutamic acid residues at these positions appear to restrain IgG molecules in a conformation that inhibits Fc:Fc interactions and CDC. In summary, a number of CDC-enhancing point mutations were identified, with amino acids E345 and E430 acting as hotspots controlling antibody hexamerization and complement activation.</p>

<title>Solution-Phase Complement Activation and Pharmacokinetics</title>
<p>For therapeutic application of the mutants, nonspecific complement activation in the extracellular fluid is undesired and hexamerization should therefore only occur after the antibody binds its target at the cell surface. We therefore incubated the panel of mutants in human serum (90%) at a high, 100 μg/ml, concentration, and we assessed the generation of complement activation product C4d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). C4d generation by heat aggregated IgG (HAG) was used as a positive control. Complement activation, indicative of hexamer formation in solution, was only observed for mutants E345R and E430F, whereas all others did not induce C4d generation.</p>

<p>To fully exclude hexamerization in vivo, we used pharmacokinetic analyses in C.B-17 SCID mice as an additional assessment. Larger molecular species of IgG, potentially interacting with C1, would be expected to clear more rapidly than monomeric IgG molecules. The observed clearance rates in mice were consistent with the observed C4d generation in human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Whereas mutants E345R and E430F displayed somewhat faster clearance rates, the other variants displayed clearance rates similar to wild-type IgG1-005.

<title>Biophysical Characterization of Antibody Hexamerization in Solution</title>
<p>To assess the suitability of the IgG mutants for their potential development as biopharmaceuticals, we analyzed their biophysical characteristics with an emphasis on methods that could detect solution-phase multimers. Firstly, we analyzed the mutants by native mass spectrometry (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref023">23</xref>]. Similar to wild-type IgG1-005, the mutants E345K and E430G only showed a charge envelope around <italic>m/z</italic> of 5,500, corresponding to a 147 kDa molecular weight (Mw) IgG monomer. Mutant E345R, in contrast, yielded an additional charge envelope around <italic>m/z</italic> of 12,500, corresponding to an 890 kDa Mw demonstrating that it forms some hexamers in solution, albeit at very low abundance (1.2% of total antibody mass) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). As a reference, we used the triple mutant IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y (RGY) that was previously shown to form hexamers in solution by HP-SEC, native MS and cryo electron tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref001">1</xref>]. An E345R-E430G double mutant and the RGY triple mutant displayed a further increase in solution-phase hexamer formation, amounting to about 7.7% and 73% of total antibody mass, respectively. We were unable to detect single mutant species with increased Mw by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) as well as multiangle laser light scattering analysis of hollow fiber flow field-flow fractionation separated fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s005">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To obtain sufficient material for the analysis of highly concentrated mAb solutions, we next generated three stable CHO cell lines producing 7D8 wild-type and the mutants E345K and E430G. Purified antibodies were concentrated to 100 mg/mL and analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), since it is exquisitely sensitive to the presence of high molecular weight species and tolerates highly concentrated protein solutions. Regression analysis of the diffusion coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref024">24</xref>] demonstrated slightly increased attractive interactions for both the E345K and E430G mutant (−17.4 x 10<sup>−3</sup> mL·g<sup>−1</sup> and −12.6 x 10<sup>−3</sup> mL·g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) compared to wild-type 7D8 (−7.57 x 10<sup>−3</sup> mL·g<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). At concentrations above 10 mg/ml, the Rhs of the two mutants increased more strongly than the wild-type antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To assess whether these slightly increased self-interactions impacted the stability of highly concentrated liquid antibody formulations, 100 mg/ml formulations in PBS of 7D8 and the mutants were incubated at 5°C for three months and monitored by biophysical methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002344.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s006">S5 Fig</xref>).

<p>The potential of the IgG1-E430G and IgG1-E345K mutants was further assessed by studying anti-CD20 antibody 11B8, for which we could address the impact of hexamerization-enhancing mutations on CDC, ADCC, as well as the induction of programmed cell death (PCD). The type II CD20 antibody 11B8 induces ADCC and PCD (in the absence of exogenous crosslinking), but not CDC.

The magnitude of PCD was similar to that induced by the wild-type 11B8 antibody and to obinutuzumab (OBN) that was used as a positive control.

<title>Efficient Lysis of CLL Patient Tumor Cells</title>
<p>Based on their strong enhancement of antigen-dependent CDC, favorable biophysical characteristics, stability, monomericity, absence of solution-phase complement activation, regular pharmacokinetics, and retained effector functions, we selected IgG1-E430G and IgG1-E345K as the preferred mutants. The therapeutic potential of these mutant IgGs was assessed in ex vivo CDC assays with tumor cells obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patient CLL cells usually are relatively resistant to anti-CD20-induced CDC due to their low CD20 and high mCRP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref016">16</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Activation of complement factor C1 by IgG antibodies via the classical pathway requires antigen binding and hexamerization of the antibody at the cell surface. Here, we show that the ability of IgG1 antibodies to form hexamers can be enhanced by single point mutations at specific amino acid positions both at the intermolecular Fc:Fc and the intramolecular C<sub>H</sub>2–C<sub>H</sub>3 interface. Several IgG1 mutants, exemplified by E430G and E345K, displayed strongly enhanced CDC that remained conditional on antigen binding at the target cell. Increased self-association of these mutants was only apparent at high (10–100 mg/mL) concentrations in solution. This self-association was fully reversible and did not result in the formation of aggregates. Furthermore, the slight increase in self-association for these mutants did not lead to solution-phase complement activation in serum or accelerated pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>Mutations of the Fc:Fc interface residue E345 yielded potent activation of CDC irrespective of the amino acid substitution. It therefore appears unlikely that mutation-specific interactions drive hexamerization. We hypothesized that the wild-type E345 side chain might restrict the conformational freedom of this residue by side chain-specific interactions with neighboring residues. Although the closest hydrogen bond donor, the H433 backbone amide, seemed too distant for direct interaction, a water-mediated hydrogen bond could possibly bridge this distance. Both E345 side chain rigidity and possibly associated water were therefore analyzed for several high-resolution, nonmutated Fc structures containing defined water molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s007">S6A Fig</xref>). Indeed, these structures displayed limited variation in E345 carboxylic acid positioning, and approximately half contained a water molecule potentially bridging the E345 carboxylic acid group and the H433 backbone amide. E345 mutations might therefore increase conformational flexibility or potentially facilitate increased movement of H433 enabling optimized interactions with the opposing Fc.</p>
<p>CDC enhancement was more sidechain-specific for other stimulatory mutations at the Fc:Fc interface. I253V, S254L, Q311L, and Q311I likely contributed to optimization of the hydrophobic consensus region interaction site at the Fc:Fc interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s007">S6B Fig</xref>). Mutations S440Y and S440W also promoted hexamerization, possibly by stacking their aromatic moieties. However, hydrogen bonding to opposing Fc backbone atoms may also be important, given the poor efficacy of S440F (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s007">S6C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>C<sub>H</sub>2:C<sub>H</sub>2 distances can vary well over 10 Å when captured by crystallization of different glycan forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002344.ref027">27</xref>]. We hypothesized that modifying the C<sub>H</sub>2–C<sub>H</sub>3 interface could lead to allosteric induction of antibody hexamerization via modulation of this dynamic conformational landscape. Functional screening identified a number of C<sub>H</sub>2–C<sub>H</sub>3 interface residues that displayed increased CDC efficacy in which residue E430 stood out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s012">S5 Table</xref>). Remarkably, substitutions of this glutamic acid to all possible amino acids stimulated CDC, suggesting that new side chain-specific effects are unlikely explanations for the allosteric stimulation. Rather, the highly conserved salt bridge formed between C<sub>H</sub>3 residue E430 and C<sub>H</sub>2 residue K338 might limit the population of C<sub>H</sub>2 domains occupying a hexamerization-favorable state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s007">S6D Fig</xref>). The disruption of the salt bridge alone, however, appeared insufficient, as modification of the pairing residue K338 only had a very limited effect on CDC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002344.s012">S5 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The glutamic acids at positions 345 and 430 are conserved in all human IgG subclasses. Since a substitution into any other amino acid results in increased hexamerization and complement activation, it may therefore be speculated that glutamic acid at these positions may play a role in restricting exaggerated complement activation. In addition, some substitutions at these two positions increased the propensity to bind C1q in solution, as measured by a target independent C4d ELISA and native MS, and led to increased clearance from the murine circulation. The prevention of IgG self-association by E345 and E430 might thus enable natural access to a more extensive fraction of the antibody repertoire expressed as soluble IgG.</p>
<p>The results described therefore provide a number of amino acid positions in the antibody Fc region that enhance the ability of IgG molecules to form hexamers, which provide a docking and activation structure for avid C1 binding and efficient complement activation. The mutants E430G and E345K exemplify the preferred IgG1 backbones. These mutants enable potent CDC for a range of antibodies against different targets, while preventing target-independent complement activation in solution at therapeutically applied mAb concentrations, which are generally &gt; 20-fold lower than natural IgG1 titers. In designing the enhanced hexamerization antibody platform, we selected backbones with optimal manufacturability and developability characteristics including criteria requiring an absence of antigen-independent complement activation. When applying the hexamerization-enhanced backbones in a novel antibody or Fc-fusion protein, a careful assessment of safety and potential efficacy will need to be performed to establish the therapeutic window, as with any new drug. For each specific disease target, it will therefore be important to determine the potential utility of enhanced IgG hexamerization as a therapeutic strategy. This potential is envisaged to be dependent on e.g., expression of antigen and its ability to multimerize, the potential downstream effects of multimerization, the expression of complement regulatory proteins on target cells, the availability of complement factors, as well as the expression of antigen on normal tissue.</p>
<p>The IgG1 Fc backbones identified provide a novel platform for the generation of therapeutics with enhanced effector functions that only become activated upon target-cell binding and hexamerization. When compared to protein- and glyco-engineered therapeutic antibody technologies based on increased binding to effector molecules with “always-on” characteristics, it is this conditional enhancement that uniquely differentiates this novel platform inspired by the naturally occurring hexamerization of IgG antibodies.</p>
