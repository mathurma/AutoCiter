<p>The authors demonstrate a connection between variability in the rate of transcription and differences in cellular mitochondrial content.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Populations of genetically identical eukaryotic cells show significant cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. However, we lack a good understanding of the origins of this variation. We have found marked cell-to-cell variability in average cellular rates of transcription. We also found marked cell-to-cell variability in the amount of cellular mitochondrial mass. We undertook fusion studies that suggested that variability in transcription rate depends on small diffusible factors. Following this, in vitro studies showed that transcription rate has a sensitive dependence on [ATP] but not on the concentration of other nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). Further experiments that perturbed populations by changing nutrient levels and available [ATP] suggested this connection holds in vivo. We found evidence that cells with higher mitochondrial mass, or higher total membrane potential, have a faster rate of transcription per unit volume of nuclear material. We also found evidence that transcription rate variability is substantially modulated by the presence of anti- or prooxidants. Daughter studies showed that a cause of variability in mitochondrial content is apparently stochastic segregation of mitochondria at division. We conclude by noting that daughters that stochastically inherit a lower mitochondrial mass than their sisters have relatively longer cell cycles. Our findings reveal a link between variability in energy metabolism and variability in transcription rate.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Though pairs of cells may have identical genes, they still show behavioural differences. These cell-to-cell differences may arise from variations in how genes are transcribed and translated by the cellular machinery. Identifying the origins of this variation is important as it helps us understand why genetically identical cells can show a range of responses to the environment. In this work, we measured the rate at which the genes yield transcripts in cultured human cells. We found marked cell-to-cell variability in average rates of transcription. This variability is related to mitochondrial content. Cells with a higher mitochondrial mass have a faster rate of transcription, and we show that part of this variability is due to the unequal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells when cells divide. Additionally, we find that cells that inherit more mitochondria divide earlier. These findings make a connection between variability in transcript production and variability in cellular mitochondrial content.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetically identical populations of cells can exhibit cell-to-cell variations in the amount of individual gene products; this can result in phenotypic diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kaern1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Raj1">[2]</xref>. The study of cellular variability was pioneered by Delbrück in the mid-forties, who measured differences in the number of phages produced by individual <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Delbruck1">[3]</xref>. Fluctuations in the small numbers of molecules involved in gene expression have been indicated as a source of this variation, and current experimental and theoretical approaches seek to anatomize the potential sources of variability, or “noise”. Variation between cells could be due to global factors such as cell cycle position or differences in numbers of transcription factors. Such changes can affect all genes and so constitute “extrinsic” sources of variability. In contrast, “intrinsic” noise is identified as molecular variation that occurs at the level of single genes and their products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Swain1">[4]</xref>. Cell-to-cell variability could be mainly the combined effect of large amounts of intrinsic variation or might be attributable to more system-wide extrinsic variation. In the following we investigate how global factors can influence transcription rate across the eukaryotic cell.</p>
<p>Experiments investigating gene expression noise suggest that gene expression variability has a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Raser1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-BarEven1">[6]</xref>. Intrinsic noise has been modelled extensively, and we have a relatively refined idea of its origin in the molecular machinery of transcription, translation, and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kaern1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Raj1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Maheshri1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Paulsson1">[8]</xref>. The magnitude of extrinsic noise is largest at intermediate levels of gene expression and dominates when gene expression is high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-BarEven1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Maheshri1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Newman1">[9]</xref>. However, the sources of extrinsic noise are not as well characterised as those of intrinsic noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Maheshri1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kaufmann1">[10]</xref>. Studies carried out in yeast have, for example, suggested cell size, cell shape, cell cycle stage, and fluctuations in an as yet unidentified upstream regulator as potential sources of extrinsic noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Newman1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Raser2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Shahrezaei1">[13]</xref>. While there has been discussion of variability in the process of transcription both in polymerase binding and in transcription elongation, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Roussel1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Ribeiro1">[16]</xref>, this is often with the principal aim of understanding intrinsic noise: in the following we will investigate how extrinsic factors might modulate transcription rate.</p>
<p>To investigate the origins of global variability in eukaryotic gene expression we undertook a study of global transcription rate. We define global transcription rate as the average rate of production of transcripts within the nucleus of a single cell. Our results, obtained using direct measurement approaches, demonstrate that there is marked cell-to-cell variability in global transcription rate. The elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) is a likely determinant of transcriptional rate, and we demonstrate that RNA pol II elongation is very sensitive to ATP concentration. We find that differences in [ATP] between cells relate to the transcription rate variability observed. We further find that the amount of mitochondrial mass and total membrane potential (indicated by total cellular luminescence of CMXRos dye) both correlate with transcription rate. Finally, we find that there is pronounced variability in mitochondrial mass in cellular populations and that a source of this variability is asymmetric segregation of mitochondria during mitosis. In combination these findings suggest that variability in mitochondrial content represents a likely source of global variability in transcription rate in eukaryotic cells.</p>

<title>Evidence for Global Variability in Transcription Rate</title>
<p>We directly measured transcription rate by recording levels of bromouridine (BrU) incorporated into nascent RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Iborra1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Jackson1">[18]</xref>. The intensity of the BrU signal in RNA containing BrU (Br-RNA) rises with time, reaching a plateau after 1 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s001">Figure S1</xref>), when equilibrium between synthesis and degradation is reached. In these experiments BrU levels were analysed on confocal sections, providing a measure of the transcription rate per unit of nuclear volume. After a short pulse of BrU (30 min) the amount of Br-RNA produced by different cells (Hela) varied dramatically across the cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s001">S1A</xref>). This variation in BrU incorporation per unit of nuclear volume was not limited to Hela cells, but was observed in other established mammalian cell lines (murine erythroleukemia cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells), immortalised cultures (EBV-transformed lymphoblasts and mouse embryonic stem cells), and, importantly, in primary cells (lymphocytes and primary human fibroblasts) with coefficients of variation (CVs) ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 (data not shown; CV is the standard deviation of the data points divided by their mean).</p>

(F) BrU incorporation is correlated with the half-life of the DNA-associated RNA pol II population. After FLIP, cells were incubated with BrU, fixed, and immunolabelled for Br-RNA. Individual cells were identified, and the values of <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for the DNA-associated form of RNA pol II and the corresponding Br-RNA intensity were plotted. (G–I) Histone H2B–GFP fast-exchanging population is a reporter of transcription elongation. (G) Hela cells expressing histone H2B–GFP were used for FLIP analysis (left panel). These cells were subsequently subjected to BrU incorporation. After identification of the same cells (middle panel), we measured Br-RNA production (right panel), which shows a good correlation (I). In (H) we show the variability in <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for the rapid-exchangeable histone H2B–GFP (transcription-dependent fraction, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s004">Figure S4</xref>) (<italic>n</italic> = 100).

<p>Many factors could possibly contribute to variability in BrU incorporation. One source of variation could be differences in staging between cells in a population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Newman1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Volfson1">[12]</xref>. We observed that the variability in total nuclear BrU incorporation remains substantial throughout the cell cycle, from a CV of 0.36 in G1 to 0.35 in G2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s001">Figure S1D and S1E</xref>), and thus, in agreement with previous studies performed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Raser2">[11]</xref>, the cell cycle was ruled out as a principal source of variability in BrU incorporation.</p>
<p>Another source of variability in BrU incorporation could be differences in the number of active molecules of RNA pol II between individual cells. Therefore, we estimated the number of active RNA pol II molecules in different cell types, using run-on experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Jackson1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Iborra3">[20]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). The results suggest that the amount of active RNA pol II molecules was approximately constant per unit of nuclear volume in a given population and across the different cell types analysed. This suggests that the variation observed in BrU incorporation is not due to differences in the number of active RNA pol II molecules between individual cells.</p>
<p>We next asked whether variability in transcription rate by RNA pol II could account for the differences in BrU incorporation observed. The transcription cycle by RNA pol II can be understood as follows: free RNA pol II molecules interact with DNA, making a complex that can either be abortive (binding to DNA and not transcribing, or transcribing a very short transcript) or that can proceed into elongation mode after being modified. Once RNA pol II elongating molecules finish the transcription cycle, they become free and diffuse throughout the nucleoplasm. This simple model thus involves steps with different kinetic properties, which we exploited to gain insight into the rate of transcription of RNA pol II in single cells. We generated a cell line (C23) in which a GFP-tagged version of wild-type RNA pol II was introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the largest catalytic subunit of RNA pol II (tsTM4). At the restrictive temperature, only the wild-type GFP–RNA pol II was functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kimura1">[21]</xref>, complementing the endogenous RNA pol II mutant (tsTM4) and thereby enabling the mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells to grow normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Sugaya1">[22]</xref>. We performed fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analysis of the wild-type GFP–RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1B–1D</xref>) and obtained <italic>K</italic><sub>off</sub> values for RNA pol II consistent with the presence of at least two populations of RNA pol II molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s003">S3</xref>), as has been previously suggested: one freely diffusible (short half-life), and another associated with the DNA (long half-life) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kimura1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Hieda1">[23]</xref>. When we analysed the <italic>K</italic><sub>off</sub> data from individual cells of the DNA-associated population (long half-life), we found a huge variation between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), with a half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) ranging from 2.5 to 30 min with a mean of 10.1 min and a standard deviation of 4.9 min, suggesting the existence of significant variation in rates of transcription elongation. The FLIP analysis exhibited a CV of 0.49, comparable with the variation in BrU incorporation we observed in this cell type (CV = 0.46). To assess whether the differences in Br-RNA between cells correspond to variation in transcription rate, we performed FLIP analysis in a group of C23 cells, followed by BrU incorporation. This experiment showed a strong relationship between DNA-associated RNA pol II <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and Br-RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The faster the RNA pol II was dissociating from the DNA, the more Br-RNA was produced, supporting the suggestion that variability in the rate of DNA dissociation was coupled to variability in the rate of transcript elongation.</p>
<p>Transcription through intact chromatin involves the removal of histone H2B in order to destabilise the nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Thiriet1">[24]</xref>, and consequently the dynamic properties of histone H2B reflect transcription elongation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kimura2">[25]</xref>. We therefore analysed the rate of exchange of fluorescently tagged histone H2B as a complementary approach to assess RNA pol II elongation rates in individual cells. Half of the nuclei of Hela cells expressing histone H2B–GFP were photobleached, and the decay of the signal in the unbleached halves was analysed. H2B–GFP showed a bi-exponential decay with a short <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> population that exchanges in a transcription-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s004">Figure S4</xref>) (∼7% of the histone H2B–GFP). The <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of the fast-turnover histone H2B–GFP showed a wide range of values, consistent with different cells transcribing at different speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1G and 1H</xref>). This was again corroborated by experiments where cells were incubated with BrU after photobleaching, showing a good relationship between H2B (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) and Br-RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). As in the case of RNA pol II, the more dynamic the exchange of H2B, the more Br-RNA was produced, and vice versa. Taken together, these results provide good evidence that transcription elongation varies significantly between different individual cells within an otherwise homogenous population.</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether all the elongating RNA pol II molecules in a given cell were transcribing at a similar speed. In order to analyse only the nascent transcripts we limited the BrU pulse to 15 min and immediately “froze” cells with sarkosyl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Jackson1">[18]</xref>. We measured the intensity of multiple individual Br-RNA foci within each nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1J and 1K</xref>). We plotted the CV of the intensity of these nascent transcripts (Br-RNA foci) versus the mean intensity of these foci in the same cell, and carried out the analysis in cells exhibiting different amounts of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1L</xref>). The data show scant change in the CV, consistent with all the polymerases that share the same nucleus transcribing at similar speed. There, thus, appears to be a global factor coupling the transcription rates of all foci across the nucleus (the variability in the rate of expression between different foci in the same nucleus is independent of the average rate of expression in the nucleus).</p>
<p>To summarise, we found a marked variability in the levels of steady state incorporation of BrU in genetically identical populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s001">S1A</xref>) (and this appears to be independent of cell cycle position; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). We then investigated the connection with transcription rate. The RNA pol II experiments suggested that there was marked cell-to-cell variability in the rate of dissociation of RNA pol II from the DNA (even though run-on data suggested that the amount of associated RNA pol II is relatively constant between cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). The H2B–GFP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1H</xref>) suggested this was related to cell-to-cell variation in transcription elongation rate. Both of the bleaching experiments suggested a correlation between DNA dissociation rates, RNA elongation rates, and the levels of BrU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This leaves the factor responsible for this cell-to-cell variation in global transcription rate unexplored, but, as the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1L</xref> show, the factor appears to be affecting all transcription foci equally in the nucleus.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>In Vitro Studies Show a Sensitive Dependence of Transcription Rate on [ATP]</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the global factor responsible for the variation in transcription rate was soluble. In a first approach we incubated cells with BrU for 30 min and analysed the intensity in the nucleus and mitochondria in individual cells. This experiment showed a strong correlation between BrU incorporation in these two compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), suggesting the factor is not nucleus specific. In a second experiment, we fused Hela cells with polyethylene glycol and after 2.5 h we carried out BrU incorporation for 30 min. This experiment showed that nuclei sharing the same cytoplasm have almost identical levels of BrU incorporation per unit of nuclear volume, showing an average CV of 0.04 (in contrast, the average CV for randomly selected pairs of nuclei from different cells was 0.50). The same was observed when the dynamic properties of RNA pol II–GFP or histone H2B–GFP were analysed in fused cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>) (note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s012">S12D</xref> the CV is the average of the CVs calculated for pairs of nuclei). Both sets of experiments suggested the existence of a small soluble factor responsible for the variation. An obvious candidate is differences in substrate content (nucleotides) available to RNA pol II in each cell. This was supported by the observation that “in vitro” transcription using a fixed concentration of bromouridine triphosphate (BrUTP) as a tracer showed a much lower degree of variability than BrU incorporation “in vivo” (CV&lt;0.10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s005">Figure S5</xref>). BrUTP incorporation “in vitro” was performed in permeabilized cells, guaranteeing an even concentration of precursors to all cells.</p>

<title>Kinetics of RNA pol II in situ: effect of NTP concentration.</title>
<p>(A) Transcription in the nucleus and mitochondria are related. Br-RNA was immunodetected in cells after BrU incorporation. Cells with a very actively transcribing nucleus also have high levels of transcription in the mitochondria. (B) Analysis of Br-RNA signals in nucleoplasm versus mitochondria (arbitrary units) in images like that in (A) (confocal images). (C) Cells were fused using polyethylene glycol and after 2.5 h were exposed for 30 min to 2.5 mM BrU. Arrows point to fused cells, where signals in nuclei sharing the same cytoplasm present very similar intensities. (D) Analysis of the CV between nuclei of neighbouring cells (mono) and nuclei sharing the same cytoplasm (multi); CV of Br-RNA incorporation (red columns), CV of RNA pol II elongating (blue columns), and CV of the dynamics of exchange of histone H2B (green columns). (E) Study of the enzymatic kinetic properties of RNA pol II with respect to [NTP]. The assay was performed as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s005">Figure S5</xref>, using as a tracer the incorporation of BrUTP into the nascent transcripts of Hela cells. This panel shows the dependence of transcription rate, <italic>V</italic> (arbitrary units/minute) on NTP concentration (micromoles). The experimental data fit a hyperbolic curve consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. (F) Plot of [NTP]/<italic>V</italic> versus [NTP]; the straight line obtained suggests that RNA pol II has Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Schulz1">[28]</xref>. (G) Dependence of <italic>V</italic> on ATP concentration (micromoles) using normotonic conditions. This curve shows a sigmoidal pattern. (H) Plot of [ATP]/<italic>V</italic> versus [ATP] suggests that RNA pol II is allosteric with respect to ATP. The sigmoidal curve of <italic>V</italic> versus [ATP] suggests that the rate of BrUTP incorporation has a quadratic dependence on [ATP]. (I) Repetition of (G) but using swollen cells (hypotonic shock) in order to decondense the chromatin. Under these conditions, the kinetics of RNA pol II with respect to [ATP] appears hyperbolic. (J) Effect of intracellular [ATP] on BrU incorporation. The intracellular [ATP] was perturbed by incubation with DG (25 mM) and no glucose for 12 h, which decreases [ATP], or incubation with succinate (5 and 10 mM) for 30 min, which increases [ATP]. Green dotted line represents BrU incorporation under ATP control conditions (high glucose, 4.5 g/l). Bars = 10 µm.</p>

<p>Based on these results, we sought to analyse the relationship between nucleotide precursors and BrU incorporation. However, even though we have a good knowledge of NTP concentrations in cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Traut1">[26]</xref>, there are no methods available to measure the nucleotide content in individual cells that are appropriate in this case. Instead, we studied the behaviour of RNA pol II with respect to [NTPs]. We used a nonradioactive method to measure the kinetic properties of RNA pol II, attached to the appropriate template, in the natural environment of the cell nucleus. Our method is based on measurements of the amount of incorporated BrUTP in nascent RNA, detected by immunofluorescence. We checked the dependence of the speed of transcription on different substrate concentrations. Cells were incubated with a cocktail containing different concentrations of all the NTPs except for ATP, which was fixed at a cell physiological level of 1 mM (henceforth NTP will refer to UTP, CTP, and GTP only). Plotting transcription rate, <italic>V</italic>, versus [NTP] yields a hyperbolic curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 80±10 µM (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.996) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>). This suggests that RNA pol II activity depends on the nucleotide content of the cell. However, the concentration of NTPs inside the cell is believed to be in the millimolar range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Traut1">[26]</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, this means that RNA pol II is effectively working at full speed with respect to NTPs (even if NTP concentration falls from 1 mM to 250 µM). Therefore, [NTP] is unlikely to be the factor responsible for the observed variation.</p>
<p>Some models for transcription in the literature have explicit and implicit energy dependences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Shea1">[27]</xref> for an example). Given this energy dependence, we also studied the RNA pol II activity with respect to [ATP] (this time fixing NTP concentration at 100 µM). The plot of <italic>V</italic> versus [ATP] showed a sigmoidal curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). A plot of [ATP]/<italic>V</italic> versus [ATP] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2H</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Schulz1">[28]</xref> emphasises this. It is thus possible that RNA pol II behaves as an allosteric enzyme (Hill coefficient of 1.5±0.34; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99; <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> 870±450 µM) with respect to ATP.</p>
<p>An allosteric behaviour of RNA pol II has not to our knowledge been previously reported, possibly because all other studies have been performed either in vitro with purified enzymes or without the near-physiological conditions necessary to minimise the perturbation of essential macromolecular complexes. Our transcription system uses physiological salt concentrations and macromolecular crowding agents that keep the molecular complexes as close as possible to “in vivo” conditions.</p>
<p>The apparent allosteric behaviour of RNA pol II is consistent with evidence that active RNA pol II forms structures containing several molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Jackson1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Iborra3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Iborra4">[29]</xref>. There are also reports of more simple viral RNA polymerase molecules that oligomerize and show cooperativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Wang1">[30]</xref>. Another explanation for this allosteric behaviour could be an effect of ATP on other proteins that influence the catalytic activity of RNA pol II. Obvious candidates are remodelling factors and/or DNA helicases that are generating template for RNA pol II in an ATP-dependent manner. In this category we can find the ATPase CHD1 (chromo-ATPase/helicase–DNA-binding domain), which remodels nucleosomes in vitro and appears to function in both elongation and termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Tran1">[31]</xref>. Another example is the remodelling complex SWI/SNF, which is also ATP dependent and associates with the RNA pol II holoenzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Wilson1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, the activity of all these factors should affect the apparent activity of RNA pol II. To study if this was the case we decided to uncouple transcription from remodelling. We reasoned that by decondensing chromatin, remodelling factors would not limit the availability of DNA, and therefore these factors would contribute very little, if at all, to the kinetics of RNA production. We explored such a possibility by repeating the study of the relation between RNA pol II kinetics and [ATP] in swollen cells. Incubation of cells in hypotonic buffer for 10 min induced chromatin decondensation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s006">Figure S6</xref>), and in these swollen nuclei the kinetic behaviour of RNA pol II with respect to [ATP] was hyperbolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2I</xref>), in contrast to the sigmoidal kinetics observed in unswollen native cells. This hyperbolic behaviour with respect to [ATP] has also been reported for remodelling factor(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Smith1">[33]</xref>; the sigmoidal kinetics of RNA pol II with respect to [ATP] may be the result of two consecutive sub-processes (elongation and remodelling) with hyperbolic kinetics.</p>
<p>Chromatin remodelling effects have been suggested as a cause of intrinsic noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Raj1">[2]</xref>, so it is interesting to note their possible role in global variability. Whatever its origin, sigmoidicity seems to be dependent on the native status of these molecules on the natural template, which means that it probably reflects an in vivo scenario. As the intracellular [ATP] is believed to be ∼1 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Traut1">[26]</xref> (close to the RNA pol II <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of ∼870 µM, found in our conditions), small fluctuations in [ATP] are likely to affect transcription elongation in vivo. (This paper is concerned with the connection between transcription rate and mitochondrial function, but we also investigated the connection between mitochondrial mass, ATP, and protein synthesis; more details can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s013">Figure S13</xref>.)</p>
<p>We presented evidence that the global factor modulating transcription rate does so for both nuclear and mitochondrial genes (and so is not nuclear specific; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Fusion studies suggested this factor is small and rapidly diffusing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In vitro studies indicate a sensitive dependence of transcription rate on [ATP] (at around cellular concentrations), while this is not the case for other NTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2E and 2G</xref>). Decondensing the chromatin eliminates this sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial Mass, Membrane Potential, and [ATP] Are Linked to Transcription Rate</title>
<p>The experiments described above suggest that the differences seen in BrU incorporation could be a reflection of cellular heterogeneity in ATP content. Indeed, in population studies where we perturbed intracellular [ATP], we observed a direct relationship between BrU incorporation and [ATP] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). A similar effect was observed in the rate of dissociation (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) of RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s007">Figure S7</xref>). By sorting cells according to their mitochondrial content (using MitoTracker Green FM dye), we found that cells with a higher transcription rate per unit volume of nuclear material also have more mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figures 3A, 3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s008">S8</xref>). Using similar sorting experiments, we found evidence that a crude measure of cellular [ATP] covaried with mitochondrial content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s009">Figure S9A and S9B</xref>). We explored this correlation further using another indicator of [ATP]. ATP is a product of mitochondrial function so we assessed the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ), which is the driving force for ATP production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Dimroth1">[34]</xref>. Cells were sorted according to tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) levels (an indicator of Δψ), and we found evidence for a correlation with an approximate measure of cellular [ATP] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s009">Figure S9C</xref>). Single-cell studies showed that both total membrane potential and also transcription rate are slowly varying (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s010">Figure S10</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s018">Video S1</xref>).

<p>(A) Hela cells were sorted according to the mitochondrial content after staining with MitoTracker Green FM. Two populations of cells were sorted, with a difference in mitochondrial content of around 5-fold (R1 and R2). (B) Four hours after plating, cells were incubated with BrU. These experiments show a direct relationship between mitochondrial content and both RNA production and mRNA content (quantification in S8A and S8B). (C) Cells stained with the redox-sensitive mitochodrial probe CMXRos (middle panel) and Br-RNA (left panel). (D) Quantitative analysis of images like that in (C) (arbitrary units).

In this plot we superimposed the data points of three different conditions used: glucose (average: blue dot), 25 mM DG (average: green dot), or 50 mM DG (average: red dot). (G) ATP affects CV in BrU incorporation. Intracellular ATP concentration was raised by succinate incubation (5 and 10 mM) for 30 min. The CV of Br-RNA is reduced in a manner proportional to ATP (blue bars), and BrU incorporation increases in parallel to intracellular ATP increase (red dotted line). (H) CV of the speed of exchange of histone H2B–GFP. This reporter behaves very similarly to BrU, decreasing as intracellular ATP increases. Bars = 10 µm.</p>

<p>To study the relationship between Δψ and the rate of BrU incorporation per unit of nuclear volume we used MitoTracker Red (CMXRos), a fixable probe (TMRM is not fixable) sequestered inside the mitochondria that depends on Δψ. After incubation with both reagents we quantified the signals in individual cells. The two parameters showed a strong relationship, suggesting that total membrane potential relates to the BrU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). To give further support we used phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (P-S6) as a reporter of the energy state of the cell. P-S6 is located downstream in the mTOR pathway. mTOR is a homeostatic [ATP] sensor, and phosphorylation of its targets is dependent on ATP concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Dennis1">[35]</xref>. One target of mTOR is the ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) that phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Sofer1">[36]</xref>. The use of P-S6 as a reporter for energy status was validated by induction of energy stress after deprivation of glucose and incubation with deoxyglucose (DG) for 12 h, which resulted in depletion of cellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Sofer1">[36]</xref> and this study, data not shown). As predicted, P-S6 decreased in response to energy depletion (), working as a surrogate reporter of the energy status of the cell. Next, we incubated cells for 30 min with BrU, and after immunolabelling with BrU and P-S6 antibodies, we observed a correlation between both signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), and both decreased in a manner proportional to the concentration of DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). We also increased the intracellular concentration of ATP by incubation with succinate at 5 and 10 mM, which increased [ATP] to 135% of normal levels, resulting in an increase in transcription rate and reduction in transcription rate variability (assessed by measuring total nuclear BrU incorporation and H2B <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figure 3G and 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>If mitochondrial activity is coupled to variability in transcription rate, then changing mitochondrial function by altering the presence of anti- or prooxidants might affect this rate and its variability. We undertook studies using the antioxidants dithiothreitol (DTT) and MnTMPyP and prooxidants diamide and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s012">Figure S12</xref>). These studies suggested that the presence of antioxidants increases transcription rate and reduces rate variability, with the opposite holding for prooxidants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s012">Figure S12B and S12C</xref>). For further discussion, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s016">Text S2</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, we find evidence suggesting that transcription rate per unit volume of nuclear material covaries with the mitochondrial mass of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figures 3A, 3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s008">S8</xref>). We also found that a measure of membrane potential (integrated over the cell) correlated with transcription rate per unit volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). By modulating intercellular nutrients we modulated intracellular [ATP] and found that this also correlated with the degree of BrU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). Further indirect studies gave support to this connection between ATP levels, mitochondrial mass, and transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figures 3F–3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s009">S9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s012">S12</xref>).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial Segregation Noise Modulates Cell Cycle Length and Contributes to Cell-to-Cell Variability in Mitochondrial Mass</title>
<p>In order to understand the origin of cell-to-cell differences in transcription rate, and given the observed connection between transcription rate and mitochondrial mass, we measured the mitochondrial content in Hela cells using MitoTracker Green FM dye. This staining demonstrates that Hela cells are heterogeneous in terms of mitochondrial content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). We investigated the asymmetric segregation of mitochondria between daughter cells as a possible source of this heterogeneity. We used for this analysis a stable cell line containing mitochondria tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). A plasmid encoding subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase fused with YFP was transfected into an epithelial-like human cell line derived from a bladder carcinoma (ECV304). The tagged subunit is incorporated into mitochondria, diffusing rapidly throughout the interior of the mitochondrion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Iborra5">[37]</xref>. This makes this chimeric protein an ideal reporter to study the behaviour of mitochondrial mass at mitosis. We focused on cells in telophase or late mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), where we measured the mitochondrial mass for each daughter cell as the integrated intensity of the mitochondrial signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Iborra6">[38]</xref>. This analysis showed that cells generically segregate mitochondria in an uneven manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the observation that mitochondrial mass segregates asymmetrically, one can ask whether this is relevant to cell physiology. Cell tracking experiments showed that mitochondrial content at mitosis correlates with cell cycle length. The daughter cells with more mitochondria progressed through the cell cycle proportionately faster than their sisters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). To rule out the trivial explanation that asymmetry in mitochondrial content was an effect of asymmetry in the volume of daughter cells, we used ECV304 cells expressing DsRed, which is a soluble protein and distributes evenly throughout the cell. The analysis of the ratio of DsRed between daughters (ratio of cell volumes) versus the ratio of time to complete a cell cycle did not show a clear relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), making it unlikely that asymmetries in the volume of daughter cells are the principle cause. We also found that daughters that inherit more mass than their sisters also have a higher rate of translation of some proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s013">Figure S13A</xref>); this further suggests that the uneven inheritance of mitochondria has an effect through the cell cycle. For further discussion, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s017">Text S3</xref>.</p>
<p>Since mitochondrial segregation is correlated with variation in cell cycle length, one might want to understand how mitochondrial partition at birth is controlled. We analysed whether the process of mitochondrial segregation had a memory. We measured the mitochondrial content ratio between daughters at birth (F1), followed each daughter for one cell cycle, and measured the mitochondrial content ratio of daughters in generation F2. When we compared F1 versus F2 in terms of asymmetry, there was no clear relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). The time to division of generation F1 cells was largely independent of the interdivision times of respective F2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). This gives us a more refined view of the stochastic character of mitochondrial segregation.</p>
<p>We have found evidence for variability in mitochondrial mass within a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). A possible cause is asymmetric segregation of mitochondrial mass at division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). Daughter cells that inherit more mitochondrial mass progress through their cell cycles faster and can show a faster rate of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s013">S13A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s013">S13D</xref>).

<title>Summary</title>
<p>This paper investigated the connection between two forms of cellular variability: variation in mitochondrial mass and variation in global transcription rate. We found marked heterogeneity in the amount of mitochondrial mass present in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and evidence for an origin of this variability in the stochastic partition of mass at point of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We further found that this variation has a cell physiological correlate: daughters that inherit relatively smaller amounts of mitochondrial mass than their sisters have longer cell cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We also presented evidence for global (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1L</xref>) variability in transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figures 1E, 1H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s001">S1A</xref>). While our experiments suggest that the numbers of bound RNA polymerases are constant and transcription rate variability is independent of cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s001">Figures S1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s002">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s005">S5</xref>), they also suggest that a small diffusing factor may be responsible for this global transcription rate modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the above, we hypothesized, first, that there was aconnection between global transcription rate variability and variability in cellular mitochondrial content and, second, that this was mediated by variation in the fast-diffusing factor ATP. Studies in permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2G</xref>) found a sensitive dependence of transcription rate on [ATP]. In vivo perturbation studies also found a correlation between cellular [ATP] and transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). We found that cells with more mitochondrial mass transcribe faster per unit volume of nuclear material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We further found that those with higher total membrane potential (as indicated by CMXRos) transcribed faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000560-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). We also found evidence correlating levels of ATP with mitochondrial mass and total membrane potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s009">Figure S9B and S9C</xref>). Finally, we found that perturbing mitochondrial function with anti- or prooxidants perturbed transcription rate variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s012">Figure S12</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies thus far have left our understanding of the origins of global variability in gene expression in higher eukaryotes unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Raj1">[2]</xref>. This paper suggests that cell-to-cell variability in mitochondria is coupled to cell-to-cell variability in global transcription rate.</p>

<title>Transcription and Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>For in vivo transcription, cells were incubated in the presence of different concentrations of BrU (Sigma) for different times (stated in figure legends). Incubation for 1 h with 100 µM DRB or for 1 h with 1 µg/ml actinomycin D prior to BrU incubation abolished BrU incorporation completely (data not shown).</p>
<p>For individual transcript analysis, Hela cells were grown on coverslips at low density then incubated for 15 min with 5 mM BrU, washed with PBS, and treated with 0.375% sarkosyl, 25 U/ml ribonuclease inhibitor, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 10 min at 20°C. Next, coverslips were tilted to allow the cell content to run out for 5 min. Samples were air-dried and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and processed for Br-RNA detection.</p>
<p>For transcription in vitro we used the conditions described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Jackson1">[18]</xref> plus 5% Ficoll 400.</p>
<p>For detection of primary transcripts, we used mouse anti-IdU/BrdU (5 mg/ml; Caltag Laboratories). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-mouse IgG tagged with Cy3 (1/200 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch). The immunodetection procedure was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Jackson1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Iborra2">[19]</xref>. DNA was stained with 200 nM TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) for 5 min, then slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and images were collected using a Radiance 2000 confocal microscope (BioRad Laboratories). Intensities in the nucleoplasm were measured using EasiVision software (Soft Imaging Systems) and data exported to Excel (Microsoft) for analysis.</p>
<p>For cell fusion experiments, Hela cells were grown on coverslips to 80% confluence. Cells were fused using polyethylene glycol as described by Schmidt-Zachmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-SchmidtZachmann1">[39]</xref>.

<title>FLIP</title>
<p>A clone stably expressing GFP–RNA pol II (C23) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Sugaya1">[22]</xref> was cultured at 39°C, and images were collected with the microscope stage heated to 39°C. Fluorescence images were collected using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META), with an EC PlnN 40×/1.3 oil objective, with the pinhole completely open. We selected a rectangle at the bottom half of each nuclei where we applied 100% laser power, in order to bleach all the fluorescent molecules in the rectangle. This operation was repeated every 5 s for a period of 1,200 s, and we analysed the decay of the fluorescence in the unbleached top half. Fluorescence intensity was analysed in MetaMorph 6.1 (Universal Imaging). Curves were analysed using Sigma Plot 8.0 for Windows. For the analysis we assumed that there were two populations, freely diffusible, bound to DNA and fully engaged in transcription. For the fitting we allowed the two components to optimise with no restriction. Data were fitted to two populations with exponential decay (always <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.99). Fixing the slow population to an average speed rendered unacceptable fittings with the second population. We were concerned with the possible artefacts induced by FLIP. Therefore, transcription “run on” experiments were performed on photobleached cells, which demonstrated no alteration in the transcription pattern or intensity in the bleached area (data not shown).</p>
<p>Hela cells expressing histone H2B–GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kimura2">[25]</xref> were used to study the dynamics of histone H2B. FLIP was performed as for C23 cells, but the time was reduced to 10 min of photobleaching and the temperature was set at 37°C. The decay curves can be fitted to a bi-exponential decay. The two initial points were discarded because they correspond with the free population of histone H2B. One possible problem with the use of the exchange of histone H2B–GFP as a transcription reporter is the impact of its overexpression. However, in the cell line used, histone H2B–GFP represents 10% of all cellular histone H2B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kimura2">[25]</xref>. The production of natural histone H2B is reduced in preserving the normal amount of histones, which means that no overexpression occurs in this cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000560-Kimura2">[25]</xref>. The fraction of free histone in the cell line used is around 1% of the total H2B–GFP, which corresponds with the fraction bleached in the first two cycles of bleaching. This population was not considered for the analysis. Even if any hyperexpression occurs in this cells, only the fraction of molecules bound to DNA and not the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> will be affected, which is the parameter studied. In agreement with this interpretation we did not observed a correlation between the initial fluorescence before bleaching of histone H2B–GFP and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000560.s004">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>

ATP concentration was determined using the kit ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II (Roche) following manufacturer instructions.</p>
<p>For antioxidant treatments, cells were incubated for 18 h with MnTMPyP (CalBiochem) or DTT (Sigma). MnTMPyP was used at 50, 25, and 12.5 µM. DTT was used at 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 µM. GSH was depleted by incubation with 200, 100, or 50 µM diamide (Sigma) for 2 h.</p>
