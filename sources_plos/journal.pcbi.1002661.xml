        <p>A fundamental goal in cellular signaling is to understand allosteric communication, the process by which signals originated at one site in a protein propagate dependably to affect remote functional sites. Here, we describe the allosteric regulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. Our analysis evidenced that communication routes established between the activation loop (A-loop) and the distant juxtamembrane region (JMR) in the native protein were disrupted by the oncogenic mutation D816V positioned in the A-loop. <italic>In silico</italic> mutagenesis provided a plausible way of restoring the protein communication detected in the native KIT by introducing a counter-balancing second mutation D792E. The communication patterns observed in the native and mutated KIT correlate perfectly with the structural and dynamical features of these proteins. Particularly, a long-distance effect of the D816V mutation manifested as an important structural re-organization of the JMR in the oncogenic mutant was completely vanished in the double mutant D816V/D792E. This detailed characterization of the allosteric communication in the different forms of KIT, native and mutants, was performed by using a modular network representation composed of <italic>communication pathways</italic> and <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic>. Such representation permits to enrich a purely mechanistic interaction-based model of protein communication by the introduction of concerted local atomic fluctuations. This method, validated on KIT receptor, may guide a rational modulation of the physiopathological activities of other receptor tyrosine kinases.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The majority of functionally important biological processes are regulated by allosteric communication within individual proteins and across protein complexes. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) control signal transduction pathways and consequently represent a typical paradigm. The mutation-induced deregulation of RTK activity impairs crucial cellular physiological functions and causes serious human diseases. The present study focuses on the allosteric communication across the three-dimensional structure of the RTK KIT cytoplasmic region. Combining a mechanistic model of information transmission with the analysis of concerted local atomic fluctuations we examined and compared the communication profiles in the native and D816V-mutated proteins. This approach permitted to localize and visualize communication routes in the native KIT and revealed that these routes were disrupted in the mutant D816V. We proposed <italic>in silico</italic> mutagenesis as a mean to restore the communication detected in the native KIT. Our work sheds light on the allosteric communication in RTKs, a phenomenon playing an essential role in signaling pathways albeit experiments do not provide the atomic details of the path followed in going from one structural element to the other. A rational understanding of the molecular determinants underlying the effects of disease-related kinase mutations may contribute to the improvement of targeted therapies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Signal transduction in cells is regulated through complex networks of dynamical interactions between macromolecules. The proteins controlling these communication networks respond to changes in the cellular environment by switching between different conformational states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Wong1">[1]</xref>. A great number of proteins acting as ligand/substrate-dependent activators contribute to cell signaling pathways. Among such proteins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a leading role in the regulation of physiological processes crucial for cell survival, growth, proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Lemmon1">[2]</xref>. In general, the binding of a ligand to the extra-cellular region of RTKs induces receptor dimerization which in turn leads to the activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. All RTKs are ATP-binding proteins and catalyze the same reaction, i.e. the transfer of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to specific tyrosine sites. They thereby trigger multiple signaling cascades via the recruitment of enzymes and adaptor proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Cherezova1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Olsen1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Kinase domains are essentially molecular switches that can adopt at least two extreme conformations – the “on” and “off” states, corresponding to maximum and minimum protein activity. The catalytically efficient “on” conformation is very similar (conserved) among all kinases. The “off” state (inactive) is not subject to the biological and structural constrains that the active state must supply, and consequently different types of kinases have developed distinct (divergent) conformations. In the native state, RTKs preexist in several conformations ranging between these two extreme ones. The equilibrium between the various conformational populations can be displaced by the binding of an extra-cellular ligand or an inhibitor, phosphorylation events or point mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Tsai1">[6]</xref>. In particular mutations are mainly responsible for the deregulation of RTK activity, provoking various forms of cancer, inflammatory diseases (e.g. arthritis) and neuronal disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's pathology) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-BlumeJensen1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The binding of a ligand/substrate/inhibitor, a point mutation, the modification of the amino acids ionization state or environmental changes (pH, temperature, concentration, ionic forces) can be considered as perturbations of a biological object and described in terms of signal propagation theory and molecular dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Chennubhotla1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Pandini1">[12]</xref>. The propagation of a perturbation signal across a protein three-dimensional structure relates to the concept of allosteric coupling or communication. The increasing amount of high-quality experimental data provides evidence that allosteric communication is a general phenomenon observed in the majority of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Gunasekaran1">[13]</xref>. Allosteric regulation is at play when a given perturbation at a specific site of a protein alters the conformational and/or thermodynamic state of a spatially distinct site in the same molecule.</p>
      <p>According to the classical view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Monod1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Koshland1">[15]</xref>, allosteric coupling occurs as an outcome of a network of interactions that physically link the coupled sites – two-state structural-based signal transmission through a unique pathway. However, multiple experimental evidences have shown that allosteric coupling can be mediated solely by transmitted changes in the protein dynamics/motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Tsai1">[6]</xref> as a consequence of a re-distribution of the protein conformational populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Demerdash1">[16]</xref>. This statement suggests the existence of multiple potential communication tracks with a preferred pathway under a given condition. Attempts were recently made to classify protein allosteric effects and illustrate those using typical examples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Tsai2">[17]</xref>. Such examples reflect the dual nature of allosteric coupling, which can be manifested in the form of a global conformational change or the modification of local atomic fluctuations. In either case, information transmission may take place through well-structured connectivity pathways or multiple dynamic micro-pathways in the protein residue network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Kar1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-delSol1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A number of <italic>in silico</italic> techniques aiming at predicting connectivity pathways that mechanically transmit allosteric interactions have been developed, based on evolutionary conservation information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Tang1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Lockless1">[22]</xref>, native contacts within the protein residue network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Atilgan1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Atilgan2">[24]</xref> or dynamical correlations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Dixit1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Ma1">[29]</xref>. Some efforts have also been made to identify specific sites in proteins that are able to accumulate energy in response to perturbations, even occurring at distant locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Piazza1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Luccioli1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Juanico1">[31]</xref>. These approaches were developed with the aim of providing a rational understanding of various allosteric effects in divergent proteins and their complexes.</p>
      <p>Mutation-driven allosteric regulation bears a particular interest due to the importance of mutations in clinical and pharmacological research. Clarkson and co-authors have observed two types of propagation responses to point mutations in serine proteinase eglin c, a small globular protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Clarkson1">[32]</xref>. One type of propagation response was discovered in the form of contiguous pathways of dynamic changes and the other as dispersed changes associated with subtle protein backbone deformations. Following these observations, Schrank and co-authors were able to design adenylate kinase mutations that impact distant functional sites only through the modulation of the protein atomic fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Schrank1">[33]</xref>. MD simulations of the native and mutated forms of the cytoplasmic protein kinase ABL and the EGF receptor probed the global allosteric changes induced by oncogenic mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Dixit2">[34]</xref>. In these cases, the allosteric communication was described in terms of a dynamic coupling between structurally rigid and conformationally adaptive segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Dixit1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Dixit3">[35]</xref>. It was supposed that these structural elements form a dynamic network of interacting functional regions that control the long-range inter-domain communication and allosteric activation in protein kinases.</p>
      <p>We are studying the type III RTK family, which includes the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor KIT, along with PDGFR, Flt3 and FMS. Upon the binding of the physiological ligand SCF, KIT ectodomain undergoes a conformational change that leads to dimerization and in turn activation of the intra-cellular protein kinase domain (PTK). The activation of KIT cytoplasmic region is characterized by a large conformational transition, that involves the detachment of the autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region (JMR, residues 544–581) from PTK, the opening of the activation loop (A-loop, residues 810–835) away from the ATP binding site and the structural rearrangement of regions such as the C-helix (residues 631–647) and the glycine-rich loop (residues 596–601) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Point mutations localized in the JMR or the PTK of KIT were identified in various forms of cancer (gastro-intestinal stromal tumors GISTs, acute myeloid leukemia AML, mast cell leukemia MCL, germ cell tumors…) and mastocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Miettinen1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Nick1">[39]</xref>. In particular, the substitution of the amino acid in position 816 located in the A-loop (indicated as a black sphere on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>) from aspartate (D) to valine (V) is an activating mutation associated with mastocytosis and cancer and is archetypal of the resistance to anti-cancer drugs such as Imatinib (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>®) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Maleddu1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Wang1">[41]</xref>.</p>

      <p>As was evidenced by X-ray data, the overall fold of KIT kinase domain is not significantly altered by point mutations in position 816 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Gajiwala1">[42]</xref>. However, we have previously demonstrated the impact of the D816V mutation on the structure and dynamics of two regulatory segments of the KIT cytoplasmic region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>. First, we have shown that D816V induces the partial unfolding of the small 817–819 helix in the A-loop, a local effect prompted by the loss of the negative capping of the helix by the aspartate in position 816. The second and noteworthy event consisted in the stabilization of the anti-parallel <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the JM-Switch fragment of the JMR located more than 15 Å away from the mutation site in the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g001"><bold>Figure 1 A</bold></xref>). This long-range effect led to a notable secondary structure reorganization of the JMR accompanied by a tertiary restructuring that resulted in an axial repositioning of the JM-Switch respectively to PTK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>. Such long distance structural effect is indubitably a manifestation of allosteric intra-molecular communication in KIT.</p>
      <p>The analysis of the interaction network between the JMR and PTK regions of KIT gave preliminary insights into the non covalent contacts alterations induced by the 816V mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>. In the present work, we described the allosteric communication in the native and D816V-mutated KIT in terms of information transmission. We evidenced (i) a well-established communication between the activation loop (A-loop) and the distant juxtamembrane region (JMR) in the native protein, (ii) the disruption of such communication in the mutant produced by the oncogenic mutation D816V and (iii) the restoring of the communication by <italic>in silico</italic> mutagenesis through a counter-balancing mutation D792E. The communication patterns observed in the native and mutated KIT correlated with their structural and dynamical properties. Particularly, the long-range effect of the D816V mutation on the JM-Switch fragment of the JMR was completely disappeared in the double mutant D816V/D792E. The JMR structure in the double mutant was found very similar to that observed in the native KIT.</p>
      <p>The accurate characterization of the allosteric communication in the different forms of KIT, native and mutants, was performed by using a modular network representation composed of <italic>communication pathways</italic> and <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Such representation enriches a purely mechanistic model of protein communication based on well-defined interactions by the introduction of concerted local atomic fluctuations. The approaches were implemented in the form of a MOdular NETwork Analysis (MONETA) package coupled with the R software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-R1">[44]</xref> and the python scripting interface of Pymol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Schrdinger1">[45]</xref>. This package permits to efficiently build, analyze and visualize modular network representations of protein three-dimensional structures.</p>

        <title>Computational modeling of allosteric communication across KIT</title>
        <p>Although molecular insight has been gained for the precise assessment of the D816V mutation induced conformational changes in KIT kinase, the description of the allosteric communication taking place between the two functionally distinct and spatially distant receptor regulatory regions – the activation loop (A-loop) and the juxtamembrane region (JMR) – remains a challenge. In the present study, a two-component molecular model of intra-protein signal propagation was used to: (a) determine key residues or regions in KIT kinase involved in allosteric coupling, (b) perform a comparative analysis of wild type KIT and D816V mutant allosteric communication profiles, (c) propose a protein-based design to neutralize the long-range effect of D816V mutation on KIT structure and dynamics.</p>
        <p>The allosteric communication across KIT tyrosine kinase was analyzed by using the conformational MD ensembles generated previously for the native (WT) and D816V-mutated (MU) KIT cytoplasmic region in the auto-inhibited inactive state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>. Intra-molecular interactions and inter-residue dynamical correlations were computed from the MD trajectories and were used to identify chains of connected residues or <italic>communication pathways</italic> and clusters of locally coupled residues or <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>The ability of KIT protein residues to communicate efficiently was evaluated by using the measure of communication propensity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Chennubhotla2">[9]</xref>. The communication between two residues is estimated as fast when their <italic>commute time</italic>, expressed as the variance of their inter-residue distance over long MD trajectories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Dixit1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Morra1">[46]</xref>, is small. We supposed that chains of residues interacting by pair and displaying high communication propensities between them would represent pathways of well-defined interactions through which information would be transmitted efficiently. We denote such chains of residues as <italic>communication pathways</italic> (<italic>CPs</italic>). Any two adjacent residues in the <italic>CP</italic> are connected by non-bonded interaction(s) and the <italic>commute time</italic> for transmitting information between any two members of a <italic>CP</italic> is below a given threshold (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for a detailed description).</p>
        <p>To identify regions of KIT that represented the most striking features of the protein's local dynamics, we used a statistical technique, local feature analysis (LFA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Zhang1">[47]</xref>. This formalism projects the correlation matrix computed from an MD trajectory in such a way that it reduces off-block diagonal correlations and identifies <italic>n seed</italic> degrees of freedom corresponding to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> atoms or residues. Further, clusters of neighboring residues centered on the <italic>n</italic> selected <italic>seed</italic> residues and displaying concerted local atomic fluctuations were defined (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details on the implementation). Assuming that they represent regions of the protein that are independent in terms of their dynamical behavior, we denote such clusters of residues as <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic> (<italic>IDSs</italic>). <italic>IDSs</italic> are believed to play a crucial role in binding and/or in allosteric propagation by shifting or exchanging their energy content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Piazza1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Luccioli1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Juanico1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Csermely1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p><italic>communication pathways</italic> and <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic> can be considered as two different media through which a given perturbation is likely to be propagated either mechanically via well-defined interactions (<italic>CPs</italic>) or via concerted local atomic fluctuations (<italic>IDSs</italic>). The combination of these two types of analyzes provided a useful two-component modeling framework for the characterization of the allosteric communication in KIT tyrosine kinase in the wild type and mutated forms. Importantly, such framework permits to go beyond a purely mechanistic model of signal propagation in proteins and to account for the duality inherent to the manifestations of allosteric coupling.</p>

        <p>The biological significance of these structural fragments was previously reported in the literature. Namely, C-loop-2 was identified as part of a “molecular brake” crucial for RTKs inactive state stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Chen1">[49]</xref>.

The E-helix was found to stabilize the ATP binding pocket in a large number of kinases through its interactions with the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Scheeff1">[50]</xref>.

The P+1 loop contains a conserved APE motif (residues 837–839) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Huse1">[51]</xref>. The F-helix was shown to play an important role in the dynamic assembly of protein kinase active structure, serving as an anchor for two hydrophobic spines that traverse both lobes of kinases, the C(catalytic)-spine and the R(regulatory)-spine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Kornev1">[52]</xref>.

        <title>D816V mutation induces a reshaping of KIT communication profile</title>
        <p>Although the communication profiles of WT and MU KIT share a similar global shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g003"><bold>Figure 3 A</bold></xref>), a number of dissimilarities are observed. For example, certain residues display shorter and less probable <italic>CPs</italic> in MU compared to WT. This deterioration of communication efficiency is particularly evident for residue V559 of the JMR, residue N652 of the C-loop-2, several residues in the E-helix (residues 764–785), the catalytic loop residues (residues 790–797), the two residues 808–809 between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the A-loop and the residues of the P+1 loop that follows the A-loop. In terms of communication, residues N652 of the C-loop-2 and residues A794, A795 and N797 of the catalytic loop are involved in dense networks of <italic>CPs</italic> that span across both lobes of the protein in WT, whereas they communicate efficiently with residues located only within one lobe in MU, the N-lobe for N652 and the C-lobe for the catalytic loop residues. This very reduced number of <italic>CPs</italic> may indicate a break in the communication between the N- and C-lobes of KIT cytoplasmic region induced by the mutation D816V.</p>
        <p>By contrast several residues in the N-lobe display slightly increased communication efficiency in MU compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g003"><bold>Figure 3 A</bold></xref>). They are located after the JMR (583–584), in the loop preceding the C-helix (residues 625–630) and in the C-helix (residues 631–647). These residues display very poor communication capability in WT while they participate in <italic>CPs</italic> that extend along the C-helix or across the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the N-lobe in MU. This increased communication of specific regions of the N-lobe is accompanied by a significant reduction of their atomic fluctuations upon D816V mutation.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the comparative analysis of WT and MU KIT communication profiles reveals that the mutation D816V alters the allosteric communication between the N- and C-lobes of KIT protein, while it favors the emergence of dense and rather localized communication networks within the N-lobe.</p>

        <p><italic>IDSs</italic> represent about one third of the total number of KIT residues and their by-residue atomic fluctuations account for 56% and 60% of the total atomic fluctuations for WT and MU, respectively. <italic>IDSs</italic> are essentially composed of residues displaying fast communications only with neighboring residues along the sequence in the [i−4; i+4] range: no or very few <italic>communication pathways</italic> (<italic>CPs</italic>) were generated from residues contained in the <italic>IDSs</italic> (traced in orange on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g003"><bold>Figure 3 A</bold></xref>).

        <p>The functional roles of these regions were previously characterized in different contexts of kinase-mediated physiological processes.

        <p>The independent analyzes performed on KIT cytoplasmic region, one based on communication propensity and the other based on local dynamic features, provide a comprehensive two-component modeling framework for the rational description of information transmission throughout KIT structure. First, <italic>communication pathways</italic> enabled to identify residues or structural elements of KIT that serve as communication hubs in the protein residue network. Second, <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic> matched regulatory segments whose plasticity and structural rearrangements are essential for the inactive-to-active transition of KIT cytoplasmic region, as it has been reported in the literature.</p>
        <p>Moreover the classification proposed here of the different regions of KIT according to their role highly connected <italic>hubs</italic> or locally correlated clusters in the protein allosteric communication can be related to recently published work identifying structurally rigid (minimally frustrated) and plastic (locally frustrated) clusters of residues in kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Dixit3">[35]</xref>. Therefore, our analysis together with the reported data contribute to bring out general trends governing allosteric communication and structure assembly in this protein family.</p>

        <title>Localization and visualization of site-to-site communication between the A-loop and the JMR regions of KIT</title>
        <p>In this section, we combined the definition of the <italic>communication pathways</italic>, <italic>CPs</italic>, and the characterization of <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic>, <italic>IDSs</italic>, to build an integrated modular network representation of KIT cytoplasmic region. We used such representation to localize and visualize the key factors governing the allosteric communication in KIT protein.</p>
        <p>In WT, the <italic>IDS S8</italic> localized in the A-loop was defined from residue 824 to 831. The analysis of non-covalent interactions between the A-loop and the other regions of the protein shows that an H(hydrogen)-bond between the hydroxyl oxygen atom of Y823 (A-loop), immediately preceding <italic>S8</italic>, and one of the carboxylate side-chain oxygen atoms (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of D792 (catalytic loop) is formed during more than 95% of the simulation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g005"><bold>Figure 5 A</bold></xref>). Moreover, residues D792, H790 and N797 of the catalytic loop are involved in a cyclic H-bond pattern to form a local interaction network that is very stable along the MD trajectories: the occupancies for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bonds are of 95% and 93% of the simulation time. These residues are also located at the crossroad of numerous <italic>CPs</italic>. In particular, one <italic>CP</italic> reaches residue V559 that immediately precedes the <italic>IDS S2</italic> in the JMR, as illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g005"><bold>Figure 5 D</bold></xref>.

        <p>Upon D816V mutation, as we previously put in evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>, the small 817–819 helix shows partial unfolding. This structural change is associated with the expansion of the <italic>IDS S8</italic> from residues 816 to 832 and results in a shifted position of the residue Y823 unfavorable to the formation of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond, whose occupancy consequently decreases by two folds down to less than 45% in MU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g005"><bold>Figure 5 B</bold></xref>). On the contrary, D792 rather interacts with N797 for more than 85% of the simulation time. Its H-bond contact with H790 side chain is perfectly preserved as in the WT (the occupancy factors are 98 and 95% respectively). This alteration of the catalytic loop local interaction network is accompanied by a drastic reduction of the catalytic loop residues capability to communicate efficiently with the distant KIT regulatory elements. As we mentioned above, several catalytic loop residues, including N797, are involved in dense networks of <italic>CPs</italic> than span both lobes of the protein in WT whereas the number of <italic>CPs</italic> is much reduced in MU and the remaining <italic>CPs</italic> are confined within the C-lobe. No established communication was observed between the residues D792 (catalytic loop) and V559 (JMR), which manifests a decoupling between the catalytic loop and the JMR in MU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g005"><bold>Figure 5 E</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>These observations suggest that the well-established allosteric communication in WT between the activation loop, A-loop, and the distant juxtamembrane region, JMR, channeled through the catalytic loop was disrupted by the oncogenic mutation D816V positioned in the A-loop. Consequently, we interpret the propagation of D816V effects between the A-loop and the JMR in terms of a communication break between the two remote sites. The structural reorganization of the JMR that we observed in MU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref> likely reflects this communication interruption. This interpretation is consistent with the results obtained by principal component analysis revealing a decoupling of A-loop and JMR motions in the mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further relate the observed changes in KIT allosteric communication with the thermodynamic properties of the protein, relative residue stability constants were calculated using the COREX/BEST algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Hilser1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Vertrees1">[63]</xref> for the WT and D816V-mutated forms. Consistent with the observed atomic fluctuations, a positive variation of 0.58 kcal/mol for the residues 816–832 (A-loop) and a negative change of −0.68 kcal/mol for the residues 560–570 (JM-Switch) stability constants were observed upon D816V mutation. These values may be indicative of the modulation of the energy landscape of KIT protein by the D816V mutation, an effect associated with the alternative communication in WT and D816V mutant unraveled here.</p>

        <title>Design of a double KIT mutant to achieve a counter-balancing/neutralizing effect</title>
        <p>Our modular network analysis of KIT cytoplasmic region has revealed the crucial role of residues Y823 and D792 in the allosteric coupling/decoupling between the A-loop and the JMR. Considering the correlation observed between the occupancy value of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond and the presence/absence of <italic>CPs</italic> between D792 (catalytic loop) and V559 (JMR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g005"><bold>Figure 5 A–B,D–E</bold></xref>), we hypothesized that a way to re-establish the communication between the A-loop, the catalytic loop and the JMR in the D816V mutant would be to restore the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond. To this aim, we substituted the aspartate (D) in position 792 by a glutamate (E), bearing the same charge and displaying a longer side chain. We anticipated that such replacement would facilitate the formation and stabilization of an H-bond with Y823 that adopted in MU an orientation unfavorable to such interaction. The <italic>in silico</italic>-designed double mutant D816V/D792E will be referred to as dbMU.</p>
        <p>To characterize the structural and dynamical properties of the double mutant (dbMU), two 50-ns MD trajectories were produced using a protocol similar to that applied for WT and MU. The RMS deviations computed on the backbone atoms of dbMU (mean value, m. v., of 2.21 Å<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.36 Å and max. at 3.48 Å) are comparable to those of WT and MU (m. v. of 2.64 Å<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.54 Å and max. at 4.04 Å, m. v. of 2.43 Å<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.35 Å and max. at 3.36 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g006"><bold>Figure 6 B</bold></xref>).

        <p>To analyze the allosteric communication in the double mutant, a modular network representation was built. The characterization of <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic> in dbMU showed two distinct <italic>IDSs</italic> in the A-loop ranging from residue 814 to 821 and from residue 824 to 831 respectively, while one extended and homogeneous <italic>IDS S8</italic> from residues 816 to 832 was identified in MU. Moreover, the atomic fluctuations of residues 824–831 are considerably reduced in dbMU (max. of 2.11 Å at G827) compared to MU, while the flexibility of the residues 816–823 is higher in dbMU (max. of 2.62 Å at I817) than in MU (max. of 2.35 Å at I817) and in WT (max. of 1.81 Å at N819 in WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g006"><bold>Figure 6 C</bold></xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of non-covalent contacts in dbMU indicates an alternative local H-bond pattern that differs from those observed in WT and MU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g005"><bold>Figure 5 C</bold></xref>). First, the replacement of aspartate (D) to glutamate (E) at position 792 restored the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond equivalent to that observed in WT (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Second, E792 interacts stably (during 94% of the simulation time) with H790. Nevertheless the H-bond acceptor partner is changed from the nitrogen atom of histidine in WT and MU to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom in dbMU. N797 residue in dbMU forms alternatively an H-bond either with H790 like in WT or with E792 like in MU with an approximately equivalent probability (45 and 51% respectively).</p>
        <p>The observed H-bond pattern in dbMU shows a hybrid nature coming from the superimposition of two networks : the cyclic H-bond local interaction network observed in WT and the H-bond evidenced in MU. This hybrid H-bond interaction network in dbMU produces first the re-establishment of the allosteric communication between the A-loop and the JMR, through the catalytic loop as a channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g005"><bold>Figure 5 F</bold></xref>) and second contributes directly or not to the conservation of the local structural changes induced by the D816V mutation (817–819 helix unfolding).</p>
        <p>To elucidate the JMR thermodynamic properties in the double mutant, binding free energies of the JMR and its fragments to PTK were calculated. As we reported previously the JMR was more tightly attached to PTK in the WT KIT than in the D816V mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>. Single-point MM-GBSA calculations (see thermodynamic cycle on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g003">Figure 3c</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>) allowed to estimate the relative attachment of JMR to PTK in dbMU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002661-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). In spite of its tendency to overestimate the absolute values of free energy differences, the MM-GBSA method was often shown to reproduce well the correct free energy trends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Stefl1">[64]</xref>. The global binding free energy change (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) between dbMU and MU is of −50.62 kcal/mol, indicating that the additional mutation D792E restores the JMR attachment to PTK as observed in the wild type KIT. The entropic contribution, which reflects the conformational variability of the JMR, is more favorable in both WT and dbMU than in MU. In addition, the enthalpic contribution is also more favorable in dbMU compared to MU, suggesting that interactions between JMR and PTK are formed upon D792E mutation. Binding free energy changes computed for the different fragments of the JMR also show tighter attachment to PTK in dbMU compared to MU, except for the highly solvent-exposed JM-P. The computed values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002661-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) are very similar to those reported for the wild type and D816V-mutated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002661-g003">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>). Consequently, these calculations reveal that the similar structural properties and dynamical behaviors displayed by the JMR in the wild type and D816V/D792E-mutated KIT forms correspond to nearly equivalent thermodynamic landscapes.</p>

        <title>The Y823-D792 link as a key factor in controlling KIT kinase activity</title>
        <p>We interpreted the long-range structural and dynamic effects induced by the D816V mutation in terms of a communication disruption between two regulatory segments of KIT cytoplasmic region. Our results emphasize the importance of both Y823 and D792 residues in the allosteric communication between the A-loop and the JMR and consequently in the stabilization of the KIT native inactive state. In this section, we confront our results with experimental data available in the literature describing the biological importance of these residues.</p>
        <p>Generally, Y823 stands as the phosphorylation site of KIT A-loop. However, recent <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of Y823F-mutated KIT cytoplasmic region has shown that this mutant is auto-activated much faster than the wild type, while it remains very sensitive to inhibitors that target KIT A-loop inactive conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-DiNitto1">[65]</xref>. These experimental observations support the hypothesis that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond is a key factor in the control of the conformational switch between KIT inactive and active states. Indeed, any event ­ the attachment of a phosphate group on Y823 side chain or the substitution of Y823 by a phenylalanine ­ that shall weaken or completely abolish the interaction with D792 promotes KIT activation. Our molecular model of KIT allosteric communication provides additional useful insights on the mechanisms by which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond disruption may provoke the structural reorganization and repositioning of the remote JMR, facilitating its detachment from PTK – the triggering first step of the enzyme inactive-to-active state transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>. It should be noted that when Y823 is substituted by a phenylalanine, an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> interaction can be established between F823 and D792 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Philip1">[66]</xref> that may still control the protein inter-conversion between inactive and active states.</p>
        <p>Residue D792 located in KIT catalytic loop is highly conserved among protein kinases and was believed to act as a general catalytic base <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Madhusudan1">[67]</xref>. However, recent studies have shown non-consistency with such suggestion and it was proposed that this aspartate may rather assist substrate positioning or dissociation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Schwartz1">[68]</xref>. Mutation of this residue in several kinases significantly reduces the reaction rate but does not abolish activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Schwartz1">[68]</xref>. Taking these data into consideration, we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> substitution of D792 by a glutamate in the structure of KIT active state (PDB id: 1PKG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Mol1">[54]</xref>), containing both ADP and peptide O-phosphotyrosine bound to the protein. The obtained active conformation of D792E mutant was found very similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that the protein active form can accommodate the longer side-chain of the glutamate with minimal structural rearrangement (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002661.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Based on this observation, we supposed the D792E mutation would impact KIT conformational dynamics by inducing a partial counter-balance to compensate the destructive effect of the D816V mutation on the allosteric communication between two regulatory regions while preserving KIT enzymatic activities. This believable design would supply a framework for the <italic>in vitro</italic> comparison of the activation rates of the double mutant D816V/D792E, single mutant D816V and the native protein.</p>
        <p>A number of other mutational hot spots were identified in KIT kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Maleddu1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Gajiwala1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Corless1">[69]</xref>, namely V560, V654, T670, D820, N822 and A829. V654 and T670 have been documented in samples from GIST patients exhibiting resistance against Imatinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Corless1">[69]</xref>. V654, located in Cloop-2, generates 12 <italic>CPs</italic> spanning across both lobes of the protein. T670, often designated as the “gatekeeper” residue as it is located at the edge of the ATP binding site, participates in the network of <italic>CPs</italic> linking the C-loop-2, the E-helix and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, our analysis suggests that these two mutational hot spots may be important for KIT allosteric communication as they likely contribute to mechanical information transmission. These suggestions agree with recent studies showing an important role for the “gatekeeper” residue T790 in the allosteric communication of the RTK EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Dixit1">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As we showed, V560 of the JMR and A829 of the A-loop were identified as residues participating in <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic>, namely the <italic>IDSs S2</italic> and <italic>S8</italic>, respectively. D820 and N822 of the A-loop, together with D816, were found part of the <italic>IDSs S8</italic> only in the D816V-mutated KIT form. This finding suggests a common activating mechanism for the mutations of these residues. By a structural analysis of KIT inactive and active structures, we previously observed that D820 and N822 side chains form an H-bond that stabilizes a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> motif in the protein inactive state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine1">[43]</xref>. The clinically observed mutations D820A/E/G/Y and N822H/K are likely to disrupt the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond resulting in the unfolding of the 820–823 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> motif, which would produce a shifted position of Y823 unfavorable to the formation of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H-bond and hence to the establishment of the communication between the activation and catalytic loops. These findings depict a consistent description of the deregulation of KIT activity by oncogenic mutations which is in agreement with the available experimental data.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>We have studied the molecular determinants of the allosteric regulation of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase in the native form and two mutated forms, the oncogenic mutant D816V and the <italic>in silico</italic>-designed double mutant D816V/D792E. We were able to describe and modulate the communication between two remote principal regulatory segments, the activation loop (A-loop) and the juxtamembrane region (JMR). A strong correlation between such communication and the structural and dynamical features of the protein was established. The analysis was realized by a made-in-house computational tool MONETA based on a two-component modeling framework. This method, validated on receptor KIT, may guide a rational description and modulation of the physiopathological activities of other receptor tyrosine kinases altered by various perturbations such as phosphorylation events, substrate, ligand or inhibitor binding. The description of networks that represent only a local area (intra-molecular component) of vast communication pathways established between proteins, constitutes a first step toward an integrated description of signaling across different spatio-temporal scales, from intra-protein to cellular levels.</p>

      <p>Modular network representations of KIT cytoplasmic region were built and visualized with MONETA.

        <p>We used a statistical technique called Local Feature Analysis (LFA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Zhang1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002661-Laine2">[53]</xref> to identify <italic>independent dynamic segments</italic> (<italic>IDSs</italic>). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002661.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> covariance matrices calculated from the 30 last ns of the MD trajectories of WT, MU and dbMU using <italic>ptraj</italic>.
