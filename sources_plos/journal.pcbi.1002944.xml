      <abstract>
        <p>Modelling the displacement of thousands of cells that move in a collective way is required for the simulation and the theoretical analysis of various biological processes. Here, we tackle this question in the controlled setting where the motion of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in a confluent epithelium is triggered by the unmasking of free surface. We develop a simple model in which cells are described as point particles with a dynamic based on the two premises that, first, cells move in a stochastic manner and, second, tend to adapt their motion to that of their neighbors. Detailed comparison to experimental data show that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of cell motion in the epithelium bulk at early times. In addition, inclusion of model “leader” cells with modified characteristics, accounts for the digitated shape of the interface which develops over the subsequent hours, providing that leader cells invade free surface more easily than other cells and coordinate their motion with their followers. The previously-described progression of the epithelium border is reproduced by the model and quantitatively explained.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Living organisms, from bacteria to large mammals, move not only as single entities but also in groups. This is true for cells in multicellular organisms. The group or collective motion of cells is an important component of development as well as processes like cancer and wound healing. To better understand this phenomenon, we have recorded the displacement of cells as they move collectively on a substrate and invade free space. The results can be accurately described by modelling the motion of cells as random but with a tendency to move at the same velocity as their neighbors. This allows us to analyze conditions under which the invasion of free space takes place, guided by a few cells that have become different of the others, as observed in the experiments. The developed model should serve as a useful basis for the description of other processes that involve collective cell motion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Interactions between moving entities correlates their motions. This takes place at all scales, from atoms and molecules, as evidenced by the familiar experiences of wind and fluid vortices to the astronomical scales of stars and galaxies. In the biological realm, collective movements are observed from colonies of bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-BenJacob1">[1]</xref> to herds of animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Couzin1">[2]</xref>. They underlie the fascinating motions of bird flocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Cavagna1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Nagy1">[4]</xref> and fish schools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Sumpter1">[5]</xref> as well as pedestrian track patterns and traffic flows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Helbing1">[6]</xref>. In these different cases, the motion of the individual organism is very complex and difficult to describe in a detailed way. However, simple models that captures important features of the interaction have proven useful for the description of collective movements. For instance, that car drivers reduces their speed when car density increases is a key property for traffic jam formation. At the level of cells, collective motion is an important component of different biological processes in multicellular organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Rorth1">[7]</xref>. It is an integral part of development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Montell1">[8]</xref>, as illustrated for instance by dorsal closure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, maintenance processes such as wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Martin1">[9]</xref>, and disorders with cancer as a prime example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Friedl1">[10]</xref>. It has been studied <italic>in vivo</italic>, in model systems such as border cell migration in drosophila oogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Bianco1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Prasad1">[12]</xref> or lateral line migration in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Ghysen1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Lecaudey1">[14]</xref>, as well as in simpler and more controlled <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments where the motion of cells is simpler to record <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Omelchenko1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Angelini2">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many aspects of the migratory behavior of cells in two dimensions have thus been studied by using the classical “wound healing” scratch assay, in which a confluent epithelium is scratched with a tool such as a pipette cone or a razor blade, so as to mechanically remove a “strip of cells” from the monolayer. The progression of the remaining cells during the “healing” of this “wound” is then observed under the microscope for up to a few days. In previous works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Poujade1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Petitjean1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Reffay1">[22]</xref>, we developed and studied a very reproducible version of these experiments in which a portion of the culture plate is masked by microfabricated stencils. Stencils removal unmasks surfaces free of cells. This produces well-defined “wounds” with rectilinear edges and precisely controlled widths and it triggers cell movements. In the subsequent hours, cells invade the free surface under the apparent guidance of “leader” cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Omelchenko1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Poujade1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Reffay1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the behavior of multiple cells in these different processes is far from complete. A model of collective cell motion should be useful to try and precisely describe these diverse phenomena. It should also allow to test and quantify the effect of different perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vitorino1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Simpson1">[23]</xref>. A pioneeringly simple description of the collective behavior of self-propelled particles in general has been proposed by Vicsek et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vicsek1">[24]</xref> based on interacting and stochastically moving particles. Several authors have since carefully analyzed this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Gregoire1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Chate1">[27]</xref> as well as related ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-DOrsogna1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Cucker2">[30]</xref>. Coordinated motion of active cells has been modelled along this line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Szabo1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Henkes1">[34]</xref> or with more extended cell descriptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Szabo2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Kabla1">[36]</xref> as well as with continuum descriptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Ouaknin1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Salm1">[39]</xref>. While these previous models provide insights in coordinated cell motion, continuum models do not account for the stochastic character of individual cell motion and simplifying assumptions, such as the use of discrete time and/or velocities of fixed-modulus, in other models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vicsek1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Gregoire1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Szabo1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Levine1">[40]</xref>, prevent detailed comparisons to experimental data. Thus, our aim here is to obtain a minimal model that quantitatively describes coordinated cell motion. We compare the developed model to motion of cells recorded in our experiments, as obtained from Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV). We find, using numerical simulations that the model accounts quite precisely for the collective cell movements studied at early times before the appearance of leader cells. We further incorporate fast-moving leader cells and determine the conditions under which they guide collective motion as in the experiments.</p>

        <title>Model of collective cell motion</title>
        <p>Our aim is to describe in the simplest quantitative fashion the collective motion of cells in an actively moving epithelium. We wish in particular to take into account that cells are actively motile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Farooqui1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vitorino1">[18]</xref>, that the motion of a cell is stochastic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Farooqui1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Gail1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Selmeczi1">[42]</xref> and that it is influenced by interactions with its neighbors. We also wish to obtain a model of minimal computational complexity that can provide a description of a large population of moving cells. A particle-based model appears best suited to this task. We thus propose and study a model of stochastically moving objects biased by their interactions with their neighbors. Each cell is reduced to its center point, the dynamics of which is described by a Langevin-like equation in continuous-time. The velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the cell <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a real two-dimensional vector which evolves as,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002944.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where the summation on the right-hand-side (r. h. s.) is performed on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cells <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that are the nearest neighbors of cell <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus, the behavior of a cell in our model is only influenced by by its closest neighbors, that is cells that are supposed to be in direct contact with it. We describe here the model main characteristics (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for implementation details). We consider cells that are actively motile and explore their environment in a random fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Farooqui1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Gail1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Selmeczi1">[42]</xref>. This is modelled in a classical way by a noisy drive (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), here described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with correlation time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The noise amplitude is first taken to be a constant, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is then generalized to a decreasing function of the local cell density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to describe the dependence of the mean cell speed on cell density. The linear damping term (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is meant to account in an effective way for dissipative processes coming from rupture of adhesive contacts or friction with the substrate or other cells. Finally, the motion of cell <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is influenced by its interaction with a neighbor in two ways. First, its velocity tends to become equal to the velocity of the neighboring cell <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vicsek1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Gregoire1">[25]</xref> with a strength determined by the coupling constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Second, the fact that cells do not overlap and have a maximal extent is taken into account by the force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between neighbor cells <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is repulsive with a hard-core at short distances and attractive at longer distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Levine1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Bindschadler1">[43]</xref>.

        <p>The model with a constant noise amplitude, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was simulated with a number of model cells (N = 4000) comparable to the number of cells in the experiments. Its parameters were adjusted to the experimental data at early time (30 min after stencil removal) by fitting correlation functions computed from model simulations to experimental velocity fields provided from PIV analysis, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>. With the obtained parameters, the simulated and experimental velocity field appeared very similar as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g001">Figure 1</xref>. This was quantitatively assessed by comparing different statistical quantities for the model and experimental data. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> histograms closely match and are both well described by the same gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s002">Figure S2</xref> A, B which displays the data plotted in log-linear coordinates, to better show the histogram tails). Similarly, the distribution of the velocity moduli is close to the corresponding Maxwellian distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 C</xref> and and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s002">Figure S2</xref> C). The experimental equal-time spatial velocity correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s002">Figure S2</xref> D, E) as well as the velocity field auto-correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 I, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s002">Figure S2</xref> F, G) are both well fitted by the model. The similarity of the correlation of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> velocity components in these plots makes further apparent the isotropy of the cell dynamics at early times. The velocity correlation length is remarkably long of the order of 150 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or about ten cells, as noted previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Poujade1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Petitjean1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Angelini2">[21]</xref>. The cell velocity auto-correlation decays with a time scale of about one hour which quantifies the time during which cells maintain their velocity. This time scale is comparable to the characteristic organization time of microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Gomes1">[44]</xref> and to the 50 min that we previously measured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Reffay1">[22]</xref> for the reorientation of the microtubule organizing center relative to the nucleus.</p>
        <p>The model provides a good description of the statistical structure of the cell velocity field, while correctly accounting for the spatial relations between neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 D, E, F</xref>). It reproduces the correlation function of cell positions, that is the probability density of finding a cell center at a distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of another cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 D</xref>) as well as the distribution of distances between neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 F</xref>). Finally, taking the center of a cell as origin, the rotation angle between the positions of two of it successive neighbors is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 E</xref>. The average angle is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as it should, and the whole angle distribution is seen to be very similar for the real and model cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2 E</xref>). In summary, we find that the interacting particle model described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002944.e003">Eq. [1]</xref> with a constant noise amplitude succeeds in capturing quite precisely cell dynamics in the epithelium bulk. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s003">Figure S3</xref>, the model continues to describe well the distribution and correlation of the cell velocity component <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parallel to the band border in the epithelium bulk for a few hours. However as time passes, the border motion influences more and more the motion of cells in the epithelium bulk as shown by the progressive departure of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distributions and correlations from their initial values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>In spite of the model simplicity, it is difficult to obtain exact expressions for the statistical quantities displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2</xref>. In order to better understand the influence of the different parameters, we considered the analytically solvable approximation of the model obtained by computing the time evolution of cell velocities as given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002944.e003">Eq. [1]</xref>, but with the cell positions fixed at the vertices of a triangular lattice, as described in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s012">Text S1</xref></italic>. The obtained expressions for the distribution of cell velocities and for the velocity correlation functions approximate that of the full model and describe their dependence on different parameters. As shown in <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s012">Text S1</xref></italic>, the noise amplitude <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> determines the cell speed scale but does not influence the shape of the cell speed distribution or the normalized velocity correlation function. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s004">Figure S4</xref> illustrates the influence of the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the velocity correlation functions. An increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> diminishes both the spatial and temporal extent of the velocity correlations. An increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases correlation spatially but has almost no effect on temporal correlations. On the contrary, an increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases correlations in time but has a very weak influence on their spatial extent.</p>
        <p>In the above-described experiments, cell density does not strongly vary in the epithelium bulk at early time. The mean cell speed however depends on the cell density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Puliafito1">[45]</xref> as shown by its decrease as cells reach confluence before stencil removal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g001">Figure 1A</xref> in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Petitjean1">[19]</xref>), as well as by the observed correlation between cell speed and cell density in migrating bands that exhibit large density heterogeneities. In order to account for this effect, we generalized the model to include a dependence of the noise amplitude <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the local cell density (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>), as written in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002944.e003">Eq. [1]</xref>, since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the main model parameter that controls the mean cell speed. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s005">Figure S5</xref>, the inclusion of this dependence does not significantly change the agreement between model and experimental data at early times. It plays however an important role in the epithelium motion at later times, as described below.</p>

        <title>Leader cells and fingers at the epithelium border</title>
        <p>Since the proposed model described well the coordinated motion of cells at early times, we investigated whether it could also reproduce the behavior of the epithelium during the whole duration of the experiments. After a couple of hours, leader cells appear and are observed to guide MDCK cell motion at the epithelium border in the form of “fingers” that invade free space, as described in previous works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Omelchenko1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Poujade1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Reffay1">[22]</xref> and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Different suggestions have previously been made as to the origin of fingers and leader cells. Proposed mechanisms include diffusion and chemo-attraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Ouaknin1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Salm1">[39]</xref> as well as an intrinsic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Mark1">[46]</xref> of the cell border hypothesized to be driven by an increased border speed in its outward curving parts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Brower1">[47]</xref>. Leader cells are about three times larger than their followers, with a size of the order of 50 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as compared to 15–25 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for other cells. They also move faster than other cells, do not divide and are often binucleated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, we here take the more conservative viewpoint that leader cells have acquired different characteristics from other cells in the epithelium. We study whether the observed fingers and border movement can be reproduced by introducing a few modified cells in our model.</p>

        <p>The dynamics of leader cells differ in several ways from those of other cells. The velocities of leader cells are found to be constant in modulus and direction to a good approximation (see Figure 7 in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Poujade1">[17]</xref>) with velocity moduli peaked around <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Contrary to other cells, leader cells display a very active lamellipodium along their whole membrane in contact with the free surface. They actively invade free surface while other cells do not. This difference in explorative behaviors may stem from the actin cable that follows the epithelium border <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Fenteany1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Tamada1">[49]</xref> and is only interrupted in leader cells. Finally, the motion of a leader cell is not independent of that of other cells. Cutting a leader cell from the following cells strongly perturbs its dynamics. Its motion becomes erratic and it regains its characteristics only after re-adhesion to the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Reffay1">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We introduced model leaders cell in our simulations that took into account these different properties in a simple way (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for details). Leader cells were created as faster cells at the epithelium border with a fixed outward predetermined velocity. The difference in explorative behaviors between leader and other cells was accounted for, in an effective manner, by a repellent force felt by non-leader cells at the epithelium border upon exploration of free surface. This repulsion disappeared as soon as the surface had been explored by a leader or another non-leader cell (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for details). In addition, a leader cell was assumed to coordinate its motion with the cells directly following it. Namely, a leader cell was assumed to slow down when it was too fast for its followers.</p>
        <p>Fingers produced with these prescriptions resemble those observed in experiments as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g003">Figure 3 A, B</xref> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s007">Figure S7</xref>. In the observed experimental fingers, the cell density is lower than in the epithelium bulk. It decreases continuously from the finger bases to their leader cell tip, as quantified previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Reffay1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g003">Figure 3 C</xref>). A very similar trend is observed in the fingers produced in the model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g003">Figure 3 D</xref>. The agreement between the experimental and model finger densities is actually surprisingly close given that the model only accounts for the increased spreading on the surface of fast moving cells but does not explicitly include more specific facts such as the more elongated shapes of cells in the fingers.</p>
        <p>The effects of the different assumed properties was assessed by relaxing or modifying some of them. Feedback on the leader cell from its followers was found necessary to prevent detachment of the leader cell from the epithelium bulk. Narrow finger-like protrusions on the interface were only present when differences in explorative behaviors between leader cells and other cells were taken into account. Similarly, the noise amplitude dependence on local cell density provided a mean for follower cells to autonomously reach a high speed. In the model with a constant noise amplitude, the leader cell was observed to slow down. It adapted to the “unrestrained” border progression speed that follower cells would adopt in absence of free surface repulsion which is of the same order as cell speed in the bulk (i.e. about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The increase of cell speed with decreasing cell density greatly increased the unrestrained border progression speed, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s008">Figure S8</xref>. This allowed leader cells to maintain a high speed when coordinating their motion with follower cells. A high border progression speed could in principle come from other mechanisms. We noted for instance that with a density-independent noise term, it could arise from the addition of cell division to the model which created an internal pressure in the epithelium. In the experiments, this alternative mechanism is probably not dominant since it is opposed by the fact that, in the epithelium bulk at high density, dividing cells have smaller areas and undergo contact inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Puliafito1">[45]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Motion of the epithelium border</title>
        <p>Having obtained a quantitative model of cell motion in the epithelium bulk and of cell entrainment by a leader cell, we investigated whether the appearance of a number of leader cells would be sufficient to account for the motion of the whole epithelium border. The rate of appearance of leader cells was measured in time and space along the epithelium border, in the experiments. It was found to be approximately constant in time and uniform along the border with a value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the first 20 hours after stencil removal and a lower value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at later times (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s009">Figure S9</xref>). It was also approximately uniform in space except that the probability of a leader cell appearance within a lateral distance of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of another leader cell was found to be very low.</p>
        <p>Simulations of the cell model were thus performed with the measured rate of leader cell creation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>).The direction of leader cell velocities was taken normal to the initial epithelium border. The moduli of their velocities were drawn according to a gaussian distribution with parameters determined by the measured leader cell velocity distribution. With a fixed number of cells, the epithelium border speed initially increased. However, the border progression then slowed down and eventually stopped when cells reached their maximal size (given in the model by the attractive part of the cell-cell interaction potential). Cell division was thus incorporated in the model. In order to avoid creating spurious internal pressure in the epithelium, a potential division was implemented only when it did not increase the cell density above the initial one (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>).</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the simulated border shapes and movements closely resemble the experimentally observed ones (see also Video S1 and Video S2). The mean border progression also quantitively agrees with the experimentally measured ones as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Both display an early regime in which the mean border position grows as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the time elapsed since the unmasking of the free surface, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Poujade1">[17]</xref>. This is followed by a later regime in which the epithelium border mean position moves approximately linearly in time i.e. at a constant speed. The previous results and model actually provide a simple explanation of both regimes. Without leader cells, the epithelium border invades the free surface at a low speed. Each new leader cell that appears entrains at its higher progression speed a portion of the border the lateral extent of which is of the order of the velocity correlation length. Therefore, the mean speed of the border progression increases with the appearance of each new leader. This speed increase is linear in time for a constant rate a leader cell appearance, resulting in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> time progression of the border (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s012">Text S1</xref></italic> for mathematical details). Crossover to the second regime takes place when the leader cell creation rate becomes low and the number of fingers increases much more slowly (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Collective motion is a remarkable feature of the dynamics of different organisms, and simple models that appear to capture the essence of this phenomenon have attracted a lot of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vicsek1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Toner1">[26]</xref>. Data collection is actively pursued for various types of coordinated movements (e. g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Cavagna1">[3]</xref>) but detailed comparisons between models and experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Couzin1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Yates1">[50]</xref> are still relatively scarce. We have developed a simple model to try and describe collective cell motion in an epithelium. The quantitative agreement between simulations and the experimental data demonstrates that our description based on the stochastic motion of interacting particules is indeed able to accurately capture the coordinated movement of cells. This agrees with a previously made analogy between cell motion in an epithelium and the dynamics of a complex fluid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Angelini2">[21]</xref>. We have furthermore shown that adding to these interacting cells, model leader cells with suitable properties, reproduce the motion of the epithelium and of its border over the whole duration of our experiments. The results provide a simple explanation for the previously-reported different regimes of border progression at early and late times. The model should therefore prove helpful to better analyze the consequences of interactions between cells and of their perturbations in different contexts. It will hopefully also be of some use in more complex <italic>in vivo</italic> situations in which cell motion can be monitored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-ArboledaEstudillo1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Keller1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Olivier1">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Existing models of collective cell motion can be classified into three broad categories : model that include an extended description of the cell membrane, based for instance on a Potts model description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Szabo2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Kabla1">[36]</xref> or a vertex description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Puliafito1">[45]</xref>, particle-based models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Szabo1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vitorino2">[33]</xref> as the one here studied, and finally continuum descriptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Ouaknin1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Salm1">[39]</xref> of tissue movement which do not explicitly describe individual cells. These three levels of description are complementary and each one has its own merits. Detailed cell descriptions allow for a more easy inclusion of biochemical and biophysical mechanisms while reduced ones are computationally more efficient, usually make use of less parameters and are easier to analyze mathematically. The model of interacting particles that we have analyzed in the present work, shares several general features with previously proposed models. The description is based as in refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Szabo1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vitorino2">[33]</xref> on self-propelling particles that repel their neighbors when they are too close and attract them when they become more distant. The model includes a velocity alignment term as initially proposed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vicsek1">[24]</xref>. However, to match the statistical properties of cell velocities in our experiment, the model departs from previous ones in significant ways. The motion of particles is not deterministic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vitorino2">[33]</xref> but stochastic. Moreover, the model does not include a preferred cell speed and without added nonlinearity, a symmetry broken phase with spontaneously aligned velocities is precluded in our model. In this respect, it qualitatively differs from the family of models studied in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vicsek1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Chate1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Cucker1">[29]</xref>. It remains to be seen whether further nonlinearities will be needed to describe cell motion in different biological conditions. Some directions studied in extended cell models appear worth studying in extensions of the present model. For instance, inclusion of a cell area variable in our particle description would allow one to take advantage of the detailed model of cell division and contact inhibition proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Puliafito1">[45]</xref>. Similarly, it has been found worth distinguishing cell velocities and cell polarization in extended cell models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Szabo2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Kabla1">[36]</xref>. Our model instead includes a memory of past velocities as in some single cell models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Selmeczi1">[42]</xref>. A comparison of these two approaches should prove useful to the understanding of cell behavior in collective migration modes.</p>
      <p>Several other features of cell motion in the proposed model deserve further attention. It should prove interesting to see how the model effective parameters emerge from more basic properties and, for instance, to elucidate whether the velocity alignment between a cell and its neighbors arises from adhesion, repeated encounters, signalling or a mix of these different processes. We have found that fingers comparable to experiments are produced when leader cells more actively invade free environment than following cells and also regulate their motion according to their contacts with following cells. The first property is reminiscent of the known role of leader cancer cells in three-dimensional geometry in degrading and remodelling the surrounding matrix to generate tracks for their followers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Nabeshima1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Friedl2">[54]</xref>. The second appears to accord with photo-ablation experiments which show that following cells provide important feedback for proper leader cell motion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Reffay1">[22]</xref>. However, both properties need to be further investigated. We have introduced leader cells without specifying what induces a cell to become a leader. Determining the role in this transformation of chemical signalling and interface geometry and mechanics would allow one to relate the present model to previous proposals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Ouaknin1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Mark1">[46]</xref>. The frequent appearance of bi-nucleated leader cells and the marked change of their creation rate after 20 hrs also point toward a role of the cell cycle that needs to be further investigated. Finally, experiments have started to classify on a large scale how different genes affect collective motion and to cluster them in different modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Vitorino1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Simpson1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Deforet1">[55]</xref>. Further work is needed to see how these correlate with the few parameters of a simple model such as the one presented here.</p>

        <p>As described in the text, normal cell explore free surface less easily than leader cells. This was modelled by introducing a repulsive force exerted on normal cells upon invasion of unexplored surface, as follows. The unexplored surface was covered by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> surface particles with a repulsive force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between pairs of particles (representing cells) and surface particles, closer than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This force was added to the r. h. s. of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002944.e003">Eq. [1]</xref> for the cell particles. The surface particles were assumed to disappear upon exploration of free surface by a particle associated to a leader or another cell. This was implemented as follows. A scalar ‘damage’ variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was associated to the surface particle <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The summation on the r.h.s. of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002944.e130">Eq.

        <p>The surface particle-normal cell interaction was modeled by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002944.e138"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e138" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was taken to be of gaussian form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with values of parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>In the simulations with free-surface, cell division was implemented with a cell doubling time of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, in order to avoid creating overpressure in the epithelium, a cell division was accepted only if it did not increase the local cell density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> above the initial cell density <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The minimization was performed with the Nelder-Mead simplex Amoeba algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002944-Press1">[56]</xref>. The starting parameters were obtained from fitting in the same way the analytical expressions obtained for the model approximation with fixed particle positions (<italic>SI text</italic> section I). In this approximate model, noise amplitude does not influence the normalized correlations and it was determined from the mean cell speed after the determination of the other parameters. In the full model, the starting noise amplitude was taken equal to the one determined in the approximate model. It was recomputed to fit the mean cell speed after the determination of the other parameters by the Amoeba algorithm. The procedure was iterated until convergence. We compared the cell-velocity auto-correlation in the model to the auto-correlation of the velocity field in the experiment because the first is the most natural quantity for the model and the second a direct output of the PIV analysis of the experiment. In principle, these two quantities can differ since the first one corresponds to following a given cell and the second one to measure cell velocity at successive times at a fixed time of space (i.e. the first is a Lagrangian quantity whereas the second is an Eulerian one). To check that they were not significantly different in the present case, we computed the velocity field in the simulation by assigning to the center of each square of a space-covering grid (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the mean velocity of particles in the considered square. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002944.s010">Figure S10</xref>, for the two grids, the model velocity field auto-correlation was not found to be significantly different from the particle velocity auto-correlation.

          <p>Comparison of the velocity auto-correlation function for the particles and for the velocity field in the model with constant noise amplitude. The cell velocity autocorrelation is shown as a continuous curve. The velocity field was defined by attributing to the center of each square of a square-grid the mean velocity of the particles that it contained. Two different squares grids were used of step size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (dashed and dotted curves). The corresponding auto-correlation are shown as dashed (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and dotted (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) curves. The different curves are very close. To gauge the difference in parameter estimates, the model velocity field auto-correlations were used to fit the PIV velocity field. The obtained values of the parameters did not significantly differ from those used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002944-g002">Figure 2</xref> (the obtained <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002944.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were (1.43, 38, 1.40) for the continuous curve, (1.42, 38,1.41) for the dashed curve; and (1.42, 38, 1.40) for the dotted curve).</p>
