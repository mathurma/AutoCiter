Here, we investigated threshold variation in auditory neurons responses recorded <italic>in vivo</italic> in barn owls. We found that spike threshold is quantitatively predicted by a model in which the threshold adapts, tracking the membrane potential at a short timescale. As a result, in these neurons, slow voltage fluctuations do not contribute to spiking because they are filtered by threshold adaptation.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons encode information in sequences of stereotypical action potentials or spikes. Spikes are all-or-none voltage deflections triggered when the membrane potential of a neuron crosses a threshold. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the spiking threshold, as measured as the voltage at the upstroke of spikes, varies with firing history and input properties. This phenomenon has been widely observed in the central nervous system, e.g. visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz2">[2]</xref>, auditory midbrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Pea1">[3]</xref>, hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Henze1">[4]</xref>, somatosensory cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref>. It has been proposed that threshold variability measured in vivo reflects an adaptation of the spike threshold to the membrane potential, due to the inactivation of sodium channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kuba1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref> or the activation of potassium channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Higgs1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Goldberg1">[10]</xref>. Threshold adaptation would have a profound influence on how the combined input of a neuron is encoded in the spiking output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kuba1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Reyes1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Fontaine1">[14]</xref>, such as enhancing coincidence detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz2">[2]</xref>, improving feature selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref> and temporal coding in sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kuba2">[15]</xref>. However, previous studies <italic>in vivo</italic> only reported correlations suggestive of threshold adaptation. Other authors have suggested that threshold variability observed <italic>in vivo</italic> could also reflect measurement artifacts because spikes are initiated at the axon initial segment but measured at the soma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Yu1">[16]</xref>. Threshold variability could also be due to channel noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-White1">[17]</xref>, slow changes in excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Grubb1">[18]</xref> or modulation by axonal synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Howard2">[19]</xref>. More generally the voltage measured at the upstroke of spikes may be a poor estimate of the actual criterion for spiking (which could depend on unobserved quantities). The goal of this study was to determine whether threshold variability observed <italic>in vivo</italic> is mainly due to threshold adaptation to the membrane potential, or to one of the alternative hypotheses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this question cannot be entirely addressed <italic>in vitro</italic>, where inputs are better controlled. First, there are potential sources of threshold variability <italic>in vivo</italic> that do not exist in vitro; in particular, noise and synaptic inputs to the initial segment. Second, properties of Na channels are likely to be different <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, Na channels can be modulated in various ways, including their peak conductance and both the time constant and voltage-dependence of inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Catterall1">[20]</xref>. Therefore, results <italic>in vitro</italic> may not readily extend to <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p>
<p>In this work we studied the dynamics of the spiking threshold in neurons of the barn owl's external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) <italic>in vivo</italic>. While the spatial tuning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Knudsen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Moiseff1">[22]</xref> and the underlying computations in ICx neurons have been investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Takahashi1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Pea3">[25]</xref>, previous studies have shown wide variation in spiking threshold over the stimulus duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Pea1">[3]</xref>. To understand this variability, we fitted a mechanistic model of spike threshold adaptation that generalizes a model based on sodium-channel inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref> to intracellular recordings <italic>in vivo</italic>. The model is used to test whether it is possible to accurately predict spiking from the membrane potential history. If threshold variability is due to noise, then this prediction should fail; if it is due to factors other than adaptation (for example phosphorylation of Na channels, or GABA inputs onto the initial segment), then the parameter values of the fitted model should depend on the stimulus.</p>
<p>The model was able to predict spikes with high accuracy and to account for most observed variance in measured threshold. In addition, it allowed us to estimate the threshold at all times, including between spikes. We found that the spike threshold tracks the membrane potential at a shorter time scale than the membrane time constant. The “effective signal” for spike initiation is then best defined as the difference between threshold and membrane potential. Fast threshold adaptation has two major functional consequences: 1) the effective signal is less variable than the membrane potential, because low frequency components of the input are filtered out; 2) the neuron can only respond to inputs with dynamics faster than the adaptation timescale, an order of magnitude lower than the membrane time constant. These findings show that most threshold variability observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in these neurons can be explained by fast adaptation to the membrane potential.</p>

Spike thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) were measured using the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> derivative, a procedure known to produce reliable estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Sekerli1">[27]</xref>. At spike initiation the derivative increases abruptly and the precise value of the criterion makes little difference to the estimated voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). The spike threshold was highly variable, spanning a range of about 8 mV (σ = 3.1±1.1 mV). In fact, the distribution of spike thresholds was so large that it overlapped the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distribution induced by the input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>).

<title>Fitting a spike threshold model</title>
<p>These observations suggest that the spike threshold adapts to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dynamics. However, what we called “spike threshold” above is in fact only a measurement of the voltage at the upstroke of spikes. It could be that the relevant criterion for spiking is a quantity (or set of quantities) other than somatic voltage, and that the voltage at the upstroke of spikes is correlated with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> history but has no causal relationship therewith.</p>
<p>To address this issue and demonstrate that the spiking criterion (and not just the measured voltage at the upstroke of spikes) adapts to the membrane potential, we used a generalization of a model of threshold adaptation based on sodium channel inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref> to predict the occurrence and timing of spikes. Our goal was to predict spike trains, not the voltage at the upstroke of spikes.</p>
<p>Although the model was derived from properties of sodium channels, we used it here as a phenomenological model of threshold adaptation, which may also be consistent with other intrinsic mechanisms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). This model consists of a differential equation describing the adaptation of the threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with a time constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003560.e016"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>A spike is predicted to occur when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. More generally, the spike threshold is defined as the voltage value at which the neuron would spike if its membrane potential were instantaneously brought above it. Thus it is a threshold in the sense of an explicit spiking criterion, unlike the empirical measurements. The function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, called the steady-state threshold, represents the value of the spike threshold when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is clamped at a fixed value. This can be considered as a general first-order model of threshold adaptation. Theory based on the properties of sodium channels predicts that the steady-state threshold is constant below the half-inactivation voltage <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and increases approximately linearly above it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>. However, threshold adaptation can also result from activation of voltage-gated potassium channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Higgs1">[9]</xref>. Therefore, to be more general, we did not impose a constant threshold below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Instead, we used a smooth function with a different slope below and above the critical voltage <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and a parameterized curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). Parameters characterizing the two slopes, the connecting point and the curvature were constrained by the data. Some threshold adaptation models also include an explicit effect of spikes on threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Badel1">[28]</xref> (the threshold increases after each spike), but it did not appear useful in our case, as we observed no correlation between ISI and spike threshold.</p>

<p>A straightforward approach would be to use this model to predict the value of spike threshold measured in the intracellular traces. However, as argued above, the measured somatic voltage at the upstroke of spikes may not correspond to the spike threshold, in the sense of a criterion for triggering a spike. For example, it has been argued that the relevant criterion should in fact be the voltage value at spike onset in the axon initial segment (AIS), where spikes are initiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Yu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kole1">[29]</xref>. Even if the somatic voltage at the upstroke of spikes truly corresponded to the spike threshold, there would still be a methodological issue with optimizing the threshold model to predict that voltage. Indeed a trivial solution to the fitting problem is the threshold model defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ms: the “spike threshold” always equals the membrane potential, in particular at the upstroke of spikes.</p>
<p>To avoid these problems, we instead used the threshold model to predict the occurrence of spikes and their precise timing based only on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The trivial solution mentioned above is a poor predictor of spikes since it would predict too many spikes. The voltage trace was thus passed through the model equation to produce a dynamic spike threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). Theory predicts that a spike should be produced when the voltage trace crosses threshold. The model can fail by producing spikes at the wrong time or by producing extra spikes. To account for both types of errors, we defined a stringent coincidence window (δ = 84 µs) and calculated the proportion of coincident spikes in both the recorded and predicted spike trains. We used the gamma factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a normalized coincidence measure that has been used in a number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Jolivet1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Rossant1">[32]</xref>. We optimized the model parameters to maximize <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on a given recording, and the model performance was then tested on different recordings in the same cell.</p>
<p>We first checked that this optimization strategy was correct on different neuron models with an explicit adaptive threshold with a time constant of 3–5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2c–e</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The first model had a fixed threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>), the second an adaptive threshold with rectified-linear characteristics (only adapts above <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>) and the third a threshold that adapted linearly in the entire voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>). Note that there is a constant bias in the predicted threshold, corresponding to the sharpness of spike initiation in these neuron models (i.e., spikes start slightly above the threshold value because sodium channels open gradually) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>. Apart from this bias, both the steady-state threshold curve and the adaptation time constant were correctly estimated by the optimization procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2c–e</xref>, bottom curves). We also confirmed that the fitting procedure yielded expected results when the threshold time constant was an order of magnitude shorter than the membrane time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2f</xref>). Finally, we checked that the resulting parameters did not depend on the input statistics, by running the optimization procedure with input currents of different means and standard deviations on models with a short threshold time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2g</xref>) and a short input autocorrelation time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g002">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p>
<p>We then applied the fitting procedure to a biophysically detailed neuron model, in which spikes are initiated in the AIS and Na channel densities in the axon were measured with immunochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Hu1">[7]</xref>. In this multicompartmental model, the value of the spike threshold measured at the soma can be accurately predicted from the value of ionic channel gating variables at the AIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>. We stimulated the model with fluctuating current, and we observed that there was a linear dependence between the measured value of the spike threshold and the logarithm of the Na inactivation variable h at the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>; slope −3.2 mV; r = −0.98). We then fitted the threshold model to the voltage response of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). After optimization, we observed that the time-varying threshold of the fitted model closely tracked the spike threshold estimated from ionic channel gating variables (which were hidden to the fitting procedure). At the spike times predicted by the fitted model, the corresponding predicted threshold was very close to the actual measured threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>). The steady-state threshold curve matched the curve calculated from the Na inactivation function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>, especially near the spike initiation region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). In the multicompartmental model, the time constant of Na inactivation is voltage-dependent, unlike in our simple threshold model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>, green). However, the fitted threshold time constant matched the value of the inactivation time constant in the spike initiation region (−50 to −40 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>, red). Finally, we found that the value of the Na inactivation variable h at the AIS could be estimated between spikes from the value of the spike threshold in the fitted model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3f</xref>; slope −0.22 mV<sup>−1</sup>; r = −0.97). Those results show that our method can successfully predict the spike threshold and characterize the sodium inactivation properties at the AIS of a complex multicompartmental neuron model containing an axon and an extended dendritic tree.</p>

<p>Taken together, these results show that our optimization strategy can indeed accurately characterize the properties of spike threshold adaptation. We then applied this technique on our recordings, where spike times were accurately predicted, with few false alarms and typical rectified-linear curves for the estimated steady-state threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). To emphasize the fact that we predict the threshold for spike initiation, and not simply the voltage at the upstroke of spikes, we show the voltage trace vs. dynamic threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>, where it can be seen that a spike is produced as soon as the identity line is crossed. Also, there are no crossings of the identity line between spikes. The absence of threshold crossings between spikes can be related to the sharpness of spike initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Naundorf1">[33]</xref>, due to the compartmentalization of spike initiation in the AIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Brette1">[34]</xref>. This observation means that the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the model predicts whether a spike is initiated, rather than simply predicting the somatic voltage at spike onset. This implies that it is indeed possible to predict spikes using only the membrane potential at the soma, even though spikes are initiated in the axon initial segment.</p>

<title>Fitted parameters are consistent among conditions</title>
<p>If threshold variability is due to ionic channel properties, then threshold parameters should depend on the cell and not on the experimental condition. On the contrary, if threshold variability were due to other factors such as synaptic input onto the axonal initial segment, we would expect these parameters values to be variable across conditions. Therefore we optimized the model parameters separately on each cell and sound-stimulation condition (e.g., one condition is varying the ITD with a fixed IID) to check for stimulus dependency. As an additional check of robustness, we divided the entire set of recordings into subsets (2–8) with different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ranges, and optimized the model parameters separately in each set.

The mean critical voltage, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, was −59±6 mV and the minimum threshold was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = −61±6 mV. Although there is some uncertainty about absolute voltage in intracellular recordings with sharp electrodes, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values are within the range of half-inactivation voltages of Na channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Angelino1">[35]</xref>. The curvature of the steady-state threshold is determined by the model parameter k<sub>a</sub> = 7±2 mV, which is in the range of measured Na activation slopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Angelino1">[35]</xref>. Finally, the threshold-adaptation time constant was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g006">Fig. 6c</xref>). Although this may seem small, time constants tend to be short in the barn owl's auditory brainstem, which is specialized for fast temporal processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kuba1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Howard1">[13]</xref>, as also seen in the timescale of spikes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g001">Fig. 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). In addition to the fact that threshold-adaptation time constants were similar across cells and recording conditions, the precise value of the model time constant was also important for predicting spikes. Fixing the time constant to a shorter or larger value than the optimal one significantly degraded the fitting quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). A consistent observation is that above <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the steady-state threshold always lies just a few mV above <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, distance between solid curve and dashed line). Thus the condition for triggering spikes is not <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exceeding a fixed threshold, but rather a fast depolarization of a few mV. This property implies that when the neuron is slowly depolarized, it does not spike because the threshold increases at the same time. It can contribute in making the neuron respond with a single spike at the onset of a current step – but not necessarily because the reset may introduce fast variations in membrane potential. Electrophysiological properties of IC neurons are not known in the barn owl, but onset electrophysiological behavior has been observed in IC neurons of rodents, although not all neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Peruzzi1">[36]</xref>. In the chick, neurons in Nucleus Laminaris, which project to IC, also respond to current steps by firing a single spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Reyes2">[37]</xref>.</p>

<p>To show that the optimized threshold time constant (about 260 µs on average) is accurate, we fitted the threshold model to the recordings while setting the time constant to a fixed value, i.e., the time constant is no longer a parameter to be optimized. The plots show the resulting gamma factor (in black, right ordinate) and explained variance (in red, left ordinate) as a function of threshold time constant for 9 cells. Moving the time constant away from its optimal value results in large increases in the fitting error.</p>

<p>The optimized parameters varied across cells but not across stimulation protocols or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ranges in the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g006">Fig. 6a–c</xref>, blue error bars). The average distance between steady-state threshold curves obtained in the same cell for different conditions was an order of magnitude smaller than the average distance between steady-state threshold curves and the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g006">Fig. 6d</xref>). These findings indicate that there is little threshold adaptation acting on a slow timescale in these neurons.</p>
<p>We then tested the optimized threshold models on recordings in the same cell that were not used for fitting the parameters, whether a different stimulation protocol or a different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> range, and we found that the models produced few false alarms (6.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g006">Fig. 6e</xref>). Finally we tested whether at spike times, the value of the spike threshold variable in the model corresponded to the measured somatic voltage at the upstroke of spikes. We found that the model threshold could account for 89% of experimentally measured “spike threshold” variance on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g006">Fig. 6f</xref>). This means that the measured somatic voltage at spike onset does in fact correspond to the spike threshold, in the sense of a criterion for triggering a spike. In addition, since this value can be accurately predicted by our model, this result implies that the measured spike threshold is in fact determined by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dynamics at the soma, rather than noise or external factors. Finally, it also implies that if there was stimulus-specific adaptation in these neurons as found in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Malmierca1">[38]</xref>, it did not act on spike threshold, since we did not include such phenomena in the model.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Functional consequences</title>
<p>We finally turn to the functional implications of spike-threshold adaptation. Since the spike threshold adapts to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, any voltage fluctuations that are slower than threshold adaptation should not have an impact on output spiking. This is captured by the concept of ‘effective signal’ (ES) illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8</xref>. The ES is the difference between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the dynamic spike threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8a</xref>). A spike is produced when the ES exceeds a fixed threshold (0 mV). Therefore, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dynamics with threshold adaptation is equivalent to the ES dynamics with a fixed threshold. In the ES, voltage variability is greatly reduced, dropping from σ = 4.4 mV in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to σ = 1.6 mV in the ES for this recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8b</xref>). This occurs because slow voltage fluctuations are filtered out by threshold adaptation. This becomes clear when we compute the autocorrelation of the voltage traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8c</xref>). We found that the half-height width (HHW) of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> autocorrelation was 4.6 ms. This value corresponds to a membrane time constant of 3.3 ms for white noise input (HHW/(2.log 2)); in this case it may also reflect the timescale of synaptic currents. In contrast, the HHW of the autocorrelation of the ES is only 0.5 ms, which is in the order of magnitude of the threshold time constant. Because of threshold adaptation, postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are effectively shortened. Specifically, the exponential decay of PSPs disappears from the ES, making the effective PSP shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8d</xref>). In all cells, voltage variability is greatly reduced by threshold adaptation: from about σ = 5.1±1.0 mV in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to σ = 2.2±0.8 mV in the ES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8e</xref>). Since threshold adaptation has little effect on the peak size of a fast PSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8d</xref>), the ratio between PSP size and background voltage variability is effectively increased. In the same way, HHW is reduced from 4.7±1.4 ms to 1.7±1.5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g008">Fig. 8f</xref>). This means that the integration time window of these neurons is about three times shorter than inferred from the membrane potential alone, making the neuron sensitive to input coincidences at a millisecond timescale.</p>

<title>Origin of threshold variability</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, the spiking threshold is highly variable, typically spanning a range of about 10 mV. This phenomenon has been observed in many areas of the nervous system: visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz2">[2]</xref>, auditory midbrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Pea1">[3]</xref>, hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Henze1">[4]</xref>, somatosensory cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref>, neocortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Goldberg1">[10]</xref>, and prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Hu1">[7]</xref>. Spike threshold has been found positively correlated with average membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Hu1">[7]</xref> and inversely correlated with the preceding rate of depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Ferragamo1">[12]</xref>. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the spike threshold adapts to the membrane potential, because of inactivation of sodium channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref> and/or activation of low-voltage activated potassium channels (Kv1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Higgs1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Goldberg1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>. However, these observations could also result in part or entirely from one or several of the following alternative causes:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item>
<p>spike threshold variability resulting from ion channel stochasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-White1">[17]</xref>, or other independent sources of noise;</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>experimental artifact where threshold appears variable at the soma but it is not at the spike-initiation zone in the axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Yu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-McCormick1">[39]</xref>;</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>spike threshold modulation by processes not directly dependent on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such as synaptic inputs to the axon initial segment (AIS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Howard2">[19]</xref>, intrinsic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Grubb1">[18]</xref> or variations in total synaptic conductance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Empirical support for threshold adaptation and for these alternative hypotheses comes from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, and therefore it is not known whether and to what extent they may explain <italic>in vivo</italic> observations. Indeed, there are potential sources of threshold variability <italic>in vivo</italic> that do not exist in vitro (noise, synaptic inputs to the initial segment), and Na channels can be modulated in various ways, including their peak conductance and both the time constant and voltage-dependence of inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Catterall1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>To distinguish between these hypotheses, we applied a predictive approach to <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings, which does not rely on measuring the somatic voltage at spike onset. Instead, the threshold model is evaluated on the basis of its ability to predict the occurrence of spikes from the previous membrane potential. This approach addresses the concern that criteria based on spike shape at the soma to measure “threshold” might inaccurately assess the actual criterion for triggering a spike.</p>
<p>In these data, the threshold model accounted for 89% of measured spike threshold variance. Therefore, most observed variability was due to deterministic processes, which ruled out hypothesis (a). It confirms theoretical considerations showing that ion channel stochasticity should imply a positive correlation between rate of depolarization and spike threshold, contrary to our and previous experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>According to hypothesis (b), spikes are actually initiated at a fixed voltage threshold, but it appears variable because it is not measured at the initiation site (in the axon). Our results discard this possibility because the threshold model is optimized to predict the occurrence of spikes, not the measured voltage at spike onset at the soma. It indeed predicts the occurrence and precise timing of spikes very accurately, and with very few false alarms. Therefore, the variability of measured somatic voltage at spike onset did reflect the variability of spike threshold in these recordings (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). It confirms theoretical considerations showing that variability due to hypothesis (b) should also imply a positive correlation between rate of depolarization and spike threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>To address hypothesis (c), we fitted the threshold model in the same cell but in different experimental conditions (either different ranges of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or different stimulus conditions). If threshold variability were due to other processes that are not directly determined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (e.g. synaptic input to the AIS or intrinsic plasticity), then we would expect the fitting process to yield different parameters values depending on context. In contrast, parameter values of the model were very robust across different conditions for the same cell, and variable between cells. These results make hypothesis (c) implausible in our recordings. On the basis of single-compartment biophysical models, it has been proposed that the total synaptic conductance may also modulate the spike threshold in a logarithmic way, by opposing the Na current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>. Our results would only be consistent with this hypothesis if total synaptic conductance were constant in all conditions (all stimuli and all mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Although it seems unlikely, we cannot entirely rule out this possibility. Recent theoretical analysis taking into account the axonal initiation of spikes indicates that the total synaptic conductance at the soma should have negligible impact on spike threshold because spike initiation is compartmentalized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Brette1">[34]</xref> (i.e., only channels expressed at the AIS can directly modulate the spike threshold).</p>
<p>Therefore, our results discard all the alternative hypotheses mentioned above, and demonstrate that threshold variability reflects deterministic adaptation of the spike threshold to the somatic membrane potential.</p>

<title>Biophysical mechanisms</title>
<p>Adaptation of spike threshold points to voltage-gated ion channels expressed in the AIS. Spike initiation is due to Na channels of the Nav1.6 subtype expressed in the distal part of the AIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Debanne1">[40]</xref>. These channels are partially inactivated at rest, and therefore voltage changes should substantially modulate the spike threshold by changing the proportion of available channels for spike initiation. The threshold model used in this study derives from a theoretical analysis of the biophysical properties of Na channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>. This analysis accurately predicted the spike threshold in a multicompartmental model of a cortical neuron with measured channel densities in the AIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>. The theory predicts that 1) the spike threshold is constant in the hyperpolarized range because Na channels are not inactivated, 2) the spike threshold follows the membrane potential in the depolarized range because activation and inactivation curves have similar slopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1">[8]</xref>, 3) the transition between the two regimes occurs at around half-inactivation voltage. Our results confirm these predictions.</p>
<p>The time constant of threshold adaptation may seem surprisingly low, about 250 µs. In Hodgkin-Huxley models, this adaptation time constant reflects the time constant of the underlying ionic channel mechanism (inactivation of Na channels or activation of K channels). Na channel inactivation time constants for subthreshold voltages are generally found to be on the order of the ms <italic>in vitro</italic>, in the cortex and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-SchmidtHieber1">[41]</xref>. However, there is evidence that the time constant of inactivation can be modulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Catterall1">[20]</xref>, and that it depends on functional constraints, such as energetic efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-SchmidtHieber1">[41]</xref>. In the electric organ of the electric fish, it has been found the inactivation time constants of Na and K channels are co-regulated, and correlate with the frequency of electrical discharges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-McAnelly1">[42]</xref>. In this particular context, Na inactivation time constant varied between 500 µs and 3 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Therefore it seems possible that this time constant is also short in a nucleus involved in the processing of sounds with frequencies of several kHz. The fact that spikes are shorter than 500 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) in our recordings is an indication that it may indeed be the case.</p>
<p>Low-voltage activated potassium channels (Kv1) are also expressed at high density in the AIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kole2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kole3">[44]</xref>. Activation of Kv1 channels by depolarization can also raise the threshold, and therefore, Kv1 channels can produce threshold adaptation with similar qualitative properties as Na channel inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2">[26]</xref>. A few <italic>in vitro</italic> studies show that pharmacologically blocking Kv1 channels can abolish threshold variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Higgs1">[9]</xref>. This could be because Kv1 channels are responsible for threshold adaptation, or because blocking these channels lowers the spike threshold so that spikes are initiated before Na channels can inactivate (this happens in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g003">Fig. 3</xref> if threshold curves are shifted down and intersect the diagonal). It is possible that the residual threshold adaptation seen in the hyperpolarized range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) is due to Kv1 channels. Clearly distinguishing between Na inactivation and Kv1 activation might require dual recordings in the soma and AIS, sodium imaging or pharmacological manipulations.</p>

<title>Threshold variability in other areas</title>
<p>Our results were obtained with <italic>in vivo</italic> intracellular recordings in the barn owl's inferior colliculus, and one may wonder to what extent they may generalize to other areas. The detailed statistics of threshold variability are similar to previous observations in cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref>, both qualitatively and quantitatively, except perhaps for the depolarization rates, which tend to be larger in our recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g001">Fig. 1f</xref>). The mechanisms of spike initiation are also widely shared across the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Debanne1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Kole3">[44]</xref>. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that our findings are generally valid. However, it is likely that the time constant of threshold adaptation (which was only a few hundred of microseconds in our study) is larger in other areas. Indeed auditory neurons in subcortical areas are known to display faster kinetics than in other areas, not only in the barn owl but also in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Oertel1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Trussell1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another likely difference is that in some <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, spike threshold was found to strongly depend on the time since the previous spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Henze1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Badel1">[28]</xref>. This is not contradictory with the model, which displays this phenomenon when the adaptation time constant is larger than the typical interspike-interval. Finally, in pyramidal cells of the cortex, and also in hippocampus neurons, the AIS is targeted by GABAergic neurons named Chandelier cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Howard2">[19]</xref>. Their action could potentially modulate the spike threshold depending on local network activity (for instance on the phase relative to theta oscillations in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Klausberger1">[47]</xref>), in a way that is not determined by the cell's Vm at the soma (hypothesis (c)).</p>

<title>Signals that elicit spikes</title>
<p>Our results show that threshold variability is mainly due to deterministic features of the input, rather than noise. Given the extent of this variability (more than 10 mV), this finding has major implications for the input-output properties of neurons. It implies that the relevant time-dependent variable is not so much the membrane potential, but rather its distance to a dynamic threshold, which we called the “effective signal”.</p>
<p>Our method allowed us to estimate the spike threshold not only at spike times but also continuously between spikes, and thus to estimate the effective signal. We found that a large part of the variability appearing in the voltage trace vanishes in the effective signal, because slow variations of the membrane potential are filtered out by threshold adaptation, leaving only variations that are faster than threshold adaptation. Secondly, we found that the effective signal varies on a shorter timescale than the membrane potential. It implies that the temporal window of integration is shorter than expected from the membrane time constant, and closer to the threshold time constant. These findings confirm previous suggestions that threshold variability enhances coincidence detection properties of cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Wilent1">[5]</xref>, and corroborate observations that spikes tend to be preceded by fast depolarizations in cortical neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003560-Azouz3">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate the causal link between membrane potential dynamics and spike threshold variability <italic>in vivo</italic>. In elucidating the deterministic nature of threshold, this work shows that threshold adaptation makes neurons selective to fast input variations and remarkably insensitive to slow ones.</p>

<title>Spike threshold measurement</title>
<p>Measured spike threshold is defined as the voltage at the onset of action potentials.

<title>Training and testing the threshold model</title>
<p>For each cell, the voltage traces were grouped in subsets. A subset is a set of traces sharing common conditions. The first type of condition used to characterize subsets is the binaural protocol used. For instance, the first subset can be the set of traces recorded when varying the ITD, another when varying IID, and another when varying average binaural intensity (ABI). Depending on the cell, there were two or three recording protocols used, resulting in two or three subsets. The second type of condition is the mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during stimulation. For each cell, responses to all sounds are ordered by mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Each subset is then constructed incrementally by adding consecutive traces until there are at least 120 spikes in the subset. This makes 2–8 subsets per cell.</p>
<p>The prediction performance is quantified using two metrics. The false alarm rate (FA), reported as a percentage, is defined as the number estimated spikes that are not coincident with recorded spikes divided by the total number of recorded spikes. The explained variance (EV) quantifies the prediction quality of the voltage at spike onset:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003560.e128"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>with<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003560.e129"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the voltage at spike onset in the recorded trace and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the predicted voltage at spike onset. These two metrics were always used on recordings not used for fitting the model (different binaural protocol or different mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>For each cell, we calculate the average distance between steady-state functions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> obtained for different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003560-g006">Fig. 6d</xref>) using the following formula:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003560.e134"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003560.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are respectively the maximum and minimum sub-threshold voltages in the trace under consideration, and n is the number of conditions.
