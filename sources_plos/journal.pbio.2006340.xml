<abstract>
<p>FERONIA (FER), a plasma membrane receptor-like kinase, is a central regulator of cell growth that integrates environmental and endogenous signals. A peptide ligand rapid alkalinization factor 1 (RALF1) binds to FER and triggers a series of downstream events, including inhibition of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase 2 activity at the cell surface and regulation of gene expression in the nucleus. We report here that, upon RALF1 binding, FER first promotes <italic>ErbB3-binding protein 1</italic> (<italic>EBP1</italic>) mRNA translation and then interacts with and phosphorylates the EBP1 protein, leading to EBP1 accumulation in the nucleus. There, EBP1 associates with the promoters of previously identified RALF1-regulated genes, such as <italic>CML38</italic>, and regulates gene transcription in response to RALF1 signaling. EBP1 appears to inhibit the RALF1 peptide response, thus forming a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL) similar to that found in circadian rhythm control. The plant RALF1-FER-EBP1 axis is reminiscent of animal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, in which EGF peptide induces EGFR to interact with and phosphorylate EBP1, promoting EBP1 nuclear accumulation to control cell growth. Thus, we suggest that in response to peptide signals, plant FER and animal EGFR use the conserved key regulator EBP1 to control cell growth in the nucleus.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) is an important regulator of plant growth and stress response and is activated by binding its peptide ligand, rapid alkalinization factor 1 (RALF1). However, how FER, a plasma membrane–localized receptor protein, regulates gene expression in the nucleus remains unclear. Here, we show that RALF1-FER signaling increases the abundance of ErbB3-binding protein 1 (EBP1) protein, which then accumulates in the nucleus and controls gene expression. The receptor kinase FER also directly interacts with and phosphorylates EBP1, a required step for EBP1 accumulation in the nucleus. Ultimately, EBP1 protein binds to the promoters of some RALF1-FER-regulated genes and inhibits their expression, leading to a negative regulation of RALF1-FER response. This study thus reveals a link between a plasma membrane receptor and the control of gene expression in the nucleus and establishes a similar mode of action for EBP1 in both animals and plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>FERONIA (FER) is a versatile receptor-like kinase (RLK) that controls nearly all aspects of plant cellular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref002">2</xref>]. FER was originally reported to regulate pollen tube reception for successful double fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref004">4</xref>]. Further studies have revealed its multiple roles in regulating vegetative cell growth. For instance, FER is required for root hair elongation in response to auxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref005">5</xref>]. FER is also essential for the expansion of leaf cells associated with brassinolide (BR) response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref006">6</xref>] and for hypocotyl cell elongation in relation to ethylene biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref007">7</xref>] and signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref008">8</xref>]. FER also regulates fruit ripening in strawberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref009">9</xref>] and tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref010">10</xref>] via ethylene biosynthesis regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref007">7</xref>]. Our recent work has shown that two <italic>FER-like receptor</italic> (<italic>FLR</italic>) genes in rice are crucial for cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref011">11</xref>]. In addition, FER is involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. <italic>fer</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref014">14</xref>], cold, and heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>] and are hypersensitive to nickel (Ni) ions but are tolerant to the heavy metals cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref015">15</xref>]. The roles of FER in stress response might be particularly attributable to its function in regulating abscisic acid (ABA) and rapid alkalinization factors (RALFs) signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref017">17</xref>]. Studies have shown that <italic>fer</italic> mutants show a hypersensitive response to exogenous ABA with respect to stomatal closure and primary root growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref017">17</xref>]. FER suppresses ABA signaling by activating an A-type protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), ABA insensitive 2 (ABI2), through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor–plant RHO-related GTPases (GEF-ROP/RAC) pathway, which in turn inhibits the ABA response mediated by sucrose nonfermenting 1–related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref017">17</xref>]. The activated ABI2 phosphatase interacts with and dephosphorylates FER to reduce FER activity, providing a cross-talk node between ABA and the RALF1 (a ligand of FER) peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>]. RALF1 is a 5-kDa peptide that rapidly induces alkalinization of cell culture medium and inhibits cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref019">19</xref>]. RALF1 binds to FER, increases FER phosphorylation, and further inhibits <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase 2 (AHA2) activity, leading to inhibition of root cell elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref020">20</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that mutations in FER can alter fungal invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref022">22</xref>], implicating FER in immune responses. Along this line, other RALF-family peptides—including RALF17, RALF23, and RALF33—may work with FER to regulate 22 amino acid fragment of bacterial flagellin (flg22)-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref016">16</xref>]. It is further shown that FER exerts its control on immune signaling through a scaffold function to facilitate the complex formation of the immune receptor complexes kinases EF-Tu receptor (EFR) and flagellin-sensing 2 (FLS2) with their coreceptor brassinosteroid insensitive 1–associated kinase 1 (BAK1) to initiate immune signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref016">16</xref>]. FER also works with several other proteins, such as RPM1-induced protein kinase (RIPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref023">23</xref>] and LLG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref024">24</xref>], to transmit RALF1 signal.</p>
<p>Although a handful of components have been identified in the RALF1 peptide signaling pathway, the mechanism by which FER regulates nuclear events remains unknown. A common theme of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus involves the modification of cytoplasmic proteins by membrane receptors and then their accumulation in the nucleus to alter gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref026">26</xref>]. In animals, this scheme has been well demonstrated by studies of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref027">27</xref>]. EGFRs consist of four distinct receptors: erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ErbB1), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref028">28</xref>]. ErbB3 is the receptor of heregulin (HRG)/neuregulin (NRG) peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref030">30</xref>]. When the HRG ligand peptide binds the ErbB3 receptor in breast cancer cells, ErbB3-binding protein 1 (EBP1) is phosphorylated by ErbB3 and accumulates in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref031">31</xref>]. Thus, in the breast cancer cell, EBP1 functions as a negative regulator of HRG-ErbB3 signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref031">31</xref>], and overexpression of EBP1 results in reduced cell growth and increased differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref032">32</xref>]. EBP1 is a DNA- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref033">33</xref>] and RNA-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref035">35</xref>] protein, and the proper localization of EBP1 is critical for its growth-suppressive properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref034">34</xref>]. In HeLa cell nuclei, EBP1 interacts with the E2F1 complex to suppress E2F1-regulated gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref033">33</xref>]. Meanwhile, EBP1 also interacts with other transcriptional repressors—such as retinoblastoma gene (Rb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref036">36</xref>], Sin3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref037">37</xref>], and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref038">38</xref>]—to suppress downstream gene transcription. EBP1 is also an RNA-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref035">35</xref>] as a part of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. EBP1 not only associates with mature and precursor rRNA species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref035">35</xref>] but also directly binds to some mRNA species and regulates their translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>EBP1 is evolutionarily conserved in both animals and plants. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> EBP1 has been previously identified as a protein that controls cell size and was named <italic>At</italic>CPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref040">40</xref>]. For simplicity, hereafter, we will use the name EBP1 in this report. Overexpression of EBP1 homologs in <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref041">41</xref>], <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref041">41</xref>], <italic>Zea mays</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref042">42</xref>], and <italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref043">43</xref>] regulate organ size in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref041">41</xref>], suggesting that the abundance of EBP1 is critical for its function in plant growth regulation. Plant EBP1 is also implicated in stress responses. For example, overexpression of <italic>AcEBP1</italic> (<italic>Atriplex canescens</italic>) increases plant low temperature, NaCl and ABA sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref044">44</xref>], and drought stress resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref044">44</xref>]. However, despite these overexpression analyses, it remains unknown how EBP1 is regulated by upstream signaling events. In search of FER partner proteins, we identified EBP1 as one of the interacting proteins. We found that RALF1-FER signaling enhanced <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA translation and further promoted its phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation in plants. EBP1 can directly bind to some chromatin loci and regulate their expression, thus connecting RALF1-FER signaling with gene regulation in the nucleus.</p>

<title>EBP1 physically associates with FER RLK</title>
<p>To identify other components in the RALF1-FER/RIPK signaling pathway, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen was performed using the FER kinase domain (FER-KD, 469–896 amino acids [aa]) as a bait against an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cDNA library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref023">23</xref>]. One truncated version (229–401 aa) of EBP1 was identified as an interacting clone. To confirm this interaction, we cloned the full-length protein of EBP1 into an active domain (AD) vector and FER-KD into a binding domain (BD) vector. The Y2H assay showed that the full-length protein of EBP1 indeed interacted with the FER-KD in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We also found that EBP1 interacted with other FER relatives that belong to the <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> receptor-like kinase 1-like kinase (<italic>Cr</italic>RLK1L) family, such as ANXUR 1 (ANX1), AT5G24010, and CURVY 1 (CVY1), in the yeast system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). A glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay showed that the full-length EBP1 protein tagged with GST (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and FER-KD tagged with 6 × His [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>] were copurified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). EBP1 also interacted with a kinase-dead version of FER-KD containing the Lys<sup>565</sup>-to-Arg mutation (FER-KD<sup>K565R</sup>-His) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref004">4</xref>] in a GST pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We further confirmed the interaction between EBP1 and FER <italic>in planta</italic> by a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts. We simultaneously transferred EBP1–C-terminal cyan fluorescent protein (cCFP) and FER-nVenus (or HERCULES2 [HERK2]-nVenus as negative control) into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts to observe the reconstituted fluorescence. We found that EBP1 interacted with FER in the plasma membranes (indicated by the styryl dye FM4-64) of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts but did not interact with HERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We performed the western blot to show that the proteins in the BiFC assay were expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). We also performed a coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay to examine the interaction between EBP1 and FER <italic>in planta</italic> using polyclonal antibodies against FER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref023">23</xref>] and EBP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s002">S2C–S2E Fig</xref>). We used plant materials with or without RALF1 treatment and found that FER and EBP1 interaction was detected in both RALF1-treated and untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Using <italic>Ubi</italic>::FER-FLAG transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>], the interaction between EBP1 and FER was also confirmed via Co-IP assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

<p>At three levels (<italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA transcription, <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA stability, and <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA translation), we investigated how RALF1 peptide elevates EBP1 protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2B–2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). We first investigated whether RALF1 induces EBP1 protein accumulation at the mRNA transcript level. The results of the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA level was not significantly affected by RALF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7A Fig</xref>), indicating that EBP1 protein levels are subject to tight posttranscriptional control through an unknown mechanism. Using cordycepin (CRD; an mRNA transcription inhibitor) to stop the <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA synthesis, we measured the rate of <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA decay and found no significant difference in RNA decay rate with or without RALF1 treatment over 2 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). <italic>ATHSPRO2</italic> (a reported gene with highly unstable mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref048">48</xref>]) was used as positive control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). We next investigated whether RALF1 promoted <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA translation by increasing its polysome profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2B–2G</xref>). We performed polysome profiling assays and found that the portion of polysome-bound <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA was increased upon RALF1 treatment for 30 minutes in Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). However, in the <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant, the <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA binding to polysomes was not increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), suggesting that RALF1-enhanced EBP1 mRNA translation was dependent on FER. The polysome-bound <italic>EIF4A1</italic> mRNA content was measured as a control, showing that RALF1 did not induce polysome binding of <italic>EIF4A1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2D and 2G</xref>). To gain further evidence for RALF1-induced <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA translation, cycloheximide (CHX; an mRNA translation inhibitor) was used to block new protein synthesis. Western blots indicated that RALF1-induced EBP1 protein accumulation was abolished by CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). When MG132 (an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome) was used, we did not observe significant change in RALF1-induced EBP1 protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2H</xref>).

<title>RALF1-induced accumulation of EBP1 in the nucleus</title>
<p>To investigate the subcellular localization of accumulated EBP1, Col-0 and <italic>fer-4</italic> plants were collected (with or without RALF1 treatment), and a nuclear fractionation assay was performed. Immunoblot assays were performed to measure the EBP1 protein content in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. In the cytoplasmic fractions of both Col-0 and <italic>fer-4</italic> plants (with or without RALF1 treatment), EBP1 was detected at a low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). RALF1 treatment only slightly increased the content of EBP1 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). However, in the nuclear fraction, EBP1 was hardly detected in Col-0 and <italic>fer-4</italic> plants without RALF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). Accumulation of EBP1 in the nucleus increased remarkably after RALF1 treatment in both Col-0 (lane 6) and <italic>fer-4</italic> (lane 8) plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). However, the nuclear EBP1 level increased more in Col-0 than in <italic>fer-4</italic>, suggesting that RALF1-induced nuclear accumulation of EBP1 is partially dependent on functional FER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). We further investigated whether EBP1 accumulation in the nucleus was RALF1 specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). When treated with PEP1 peptide (AT5G64900), ABA, and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), no distinct EBP1 nuclear accumulation was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>EBP1 is localized in the nucleus upon activation of the EGFR pathway in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref031">31</xref>]. In plants, a previous work reported that EBP1–green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<italic>At</italic>CPR-GFP) can be detected by GFP fluorescence in the guard cells but not in other cell types, even when its expression is driven by the <italic>35S</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref040">40</xref>]. We made overexpressing transgenic plants harboring a <italic>35S</italic>::EBP1-GFP construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7D–S7F Fig</xref>) and further obtained <italic>fer-4</italic>/<italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> hybrid plants. Consistent with the previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref040">40</xref>], we observed GFP fluorescence in the <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> transgenic plant guard cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7G Fig</xref>). However, we detected only weak GFP fluorescence in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2J</xref>), although we detected a high level of <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7E Fig</xref>). Driven by these results, we further visualized GFP signaling in 7-DAG <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> and <italic>fer-4</italic>/<italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> seedlings (treated with or without 1 μM RALF1 peptide in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog [MS] liquid medium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2J</xref>).

However, RALF1 did not enhance GFP intensity in the roots of <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s008">S8B Fig</xref>), and free GFP was not detected in plant sample expressing EBP1-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s002">S2D Fig</xref>), suggesting that the RALF1-induced fluorescence enhancement is attributed to EBP1-GFP fusion protein rather than free GFP accumulation.</p>
<p>To further prove that RALF1 could promote EBP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus in an FER-dependent manner, an immunofluorescence assay was performed using EBP1 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Without RALF1 treatment, weak fluorescence was observed both in Col-0 and <italic>fer-4</italic> root cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Before RALF1 treatment, we noted that EBP1 protein level was slightly higher in the <italic>fer-4</italic> background when compared with wild type (WT), which is briefly commented on in the Discussion section. With RALF1 treatment, the EBP1 protein was accumulated in the nucleus in Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). The nuclear staining dye DAPI was used to confirm the localization of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). However, in the RALF1-treated <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant, weak fluorescence was observed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that RALF1 peptide promoted <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA translation and protein accumulation in the nucleus in an FER-dependent manner.</p>

<title>EBP1 nuclear accumulation and phosphorylation in response to the RALF1-FER signaling pathway</title>
<p>As a kinase-interacting protein, EBP1 could potentially be phosphorylated by FER. A coexpression system in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was designed to examine the dynamics and the in vivo phosphorylation process. This system has been used successfully to study RLK-mediated phosphorylation reaction in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref049">49</xref>]. Our previous work has shown that PP2C-A-type protein phosphatases (such as ABI1 and ABI2) interact with and dephosphorylate FER, thus inhibiting the kinase activity of FER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>]. It is also known that the ABA receptor pyrabactin resistance 1-like 1 (PYL1) attenuates ABI1’s inhibitory effect on FER in the presence of ABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>]. Based on these findings, we constructed an ABA-induced in vitro phosphorylation system to investigate whether EBP1 is a phosphorylation substrate of FER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We coexpressed PYL1, ABI1, FER-KD, and EBP1 (PYL1/ABI1/FER-KD/EBP1) in one <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain. In parallel, we coexpressed the same proteins except for a mutant version of FER-KD that contained the Lys<sup>565</sup>-to-Arg mutation (FER-KD<sup>K565R</sup>) to abolish its kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref004">4</xref>] as negative control. When ABA was not added to the culture, ABI1 would inhibit FER activity to avoid its phosphorylation ability toward to its substrate. After ABA was added to the culture medium, the PYL1-ABA complex interacted with and inhibited ABI1 activity, thus releasing the active FER-KD kinase. In the assay, EBP1 was fused with a His-tag, and FER-KD (or FER-KD<sup>K565R</sup>) was fused with an S-tag so that an immunoblot assay could be used to detect phosphorylation-related band shifts, as in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref012">12</xref>].</p>

<p>(A) In vitro phosphorylation assay of EBP1. The phosphorylated and dephosphorylated FER-KD-S and EBP1-His are indicated. Anti-S-tag was used to detect FER-KD-S. Anti-His was used to detect EBP1-His. CBB staining is displayed as loading control. The diagram shows the skeleton of an ABA-triggered phosphorylation system. (B) Phosphorylation assay of the IP EBP1. The phosphorylation level of FER is measured by the intensity of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated FER bands detected with FER antibody. pSer and pThr antibodies were used to detect the phosphorylated EBP1. For RALF1 treatment, 4-week-old Col-0 and <italic>fer-4</italic> plants were soaked in 1/2 MS liquid medium with or without 1 μM RALF1 for 30 minutes. EBP1 antibody was used to indicate loading control. We adjusted the level of total EBP1 protein to be same so that the changes in phosphorylation level of EBP1 can be easily visible. Three independent experiments of (A) and (B) were performed, and similar results were obtained. (C) Subcellular localizations of EBP1-GFP and mEBP1-10A-GFP in the root tip. Pseudocolor images show the signal intensities of the GFP signal. Color code bar indicates the relative intensities. The original pictures of GFP and DAPI signals are shown.

<p>First, we detected the phosphorylation status of FER-KD fused to S-tag (FER-KD-S) to ensure that this system worked. When no ABA was added, no band shift attributable to FER-KD phosphorylation was detected (lane 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Once ABA was added, the band shift was detected (lane 2), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) dephosphorylated and eliminated band shifts in FER-KD (lane 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This result proved that the addition of ABA activated FER-KD-S phosphorylation activity, and therefore, we investigated whether FER-KD could phosphorylate EBP1 in this system. Indeed, in the absence of ABA, no phosphorylation-dependent shift of EBP1 was detected (lane 1), whereas the addition of 50 μM ABA induced EBP1 phosphorylation (p-EBP1) (lane 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The ABA-dependent shift of the EBP1 protein band resulted from phosphorylation, because AP dephosphorylated and eliminated this shift in the EBP1 band (lane 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This EBP1 phosphorylation was dependent on active FER kinase, because ABA did not induce an EBP1 band shift when added into the culture medium of the cells containing the kinase-dead FER-KD<sup>K565R</sup>, PYL1, ABI1, and EBP1 (lane 3 and 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To further investigate whether EBP1 was phosphorylated by FER in vivo, we immunoprecipitated the EBP1 protein from Col-0 and <italic>fer-4</italic> plants roots using an EBP1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Because RALF1-FER pathway alters EBP1 abundance in plants, we had to adjust the total protein levels of EBP1 from different samples to be comparable so that the changes in the phosphorylation levels of EBP1 protein can be easily visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Because the mobility shift between EBP1 and p-EBP1 was small, we used phosphoserine (pSer) and phosphothreonine (pThr) antibodies to monitor the phosphorylation level of EBP1. Before RALF1 treatment, the EBP1 pSer and pThr phosphorylation levels in Col-0 were both higher than those in <italic>fer-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). After RALF1 treatment, the EBP1 pSer and pThr phosphorylation levels were increased in Col-0 but not in the <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), and the FER phosphorylation level was up-regulated, as indicated by the band shift assays. Thus, the phosphorylation assays suggest that EBP1 was phosphorylated by FER kinase.</p>
<p>To identify the phosphorylation sites of EBP1, the phosphorylation assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref> was performed at a larger scale, and EBP1 was purified and analyzed using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Ten EBP1 aa residues (Ser<sup>13</sup>, Thr<sup>15</sup>, Ser<sup>16</sup>, Thr<sup>242</sup>, Thr<sup>243</sup>, Tyr<sup>245</sup>, Ser<sup>378</sup>, Thr<sup>379</sup>, Ser<sup>387</sup>, and Ser<sup>388</sup>) were identified as phosphorylated in the sample containing ABA-incubated PYL1/ABI1/FER-KD/EBP1 system, but no phosphorylation was observed either in the absence of ABA or in the ABA-incubated PYL1/ABI1/FER-KD<sup>K565R</sup>/EBP1 system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). To further confirm these 10 phosphorylation sites, we simultaneously mutated all 10 identified phosphorylation sites to alanine residues (yielding mEBP1-10A) to constitutively inactivate these phosphorylation sites and tested whether mutated mEBP1-10A-His was phosphorylated by FER-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The results showed that, although ABA activated FER-KD, mEBP1-10A-His was not phosphorylated by FER-KD (comparing lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that one or multiple of these residues may be phosphorylated by FER.</p>
<p>We next further analyzed the physiological roles of these 10 phosphorylation sites. Based on the domain structure of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> EBP1 protein, we analyzed the locations of the 10 phosphorylation sites of EBP1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). We found that 7 phosphorylation sites were located at the N-terminal and C-terminal potential nuclear localization–related regions (NLRs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). To investigate whether these p-EBP1 sites were critical for EBP1 to accumulate in the nucleus, we further tested the functional relevance of these 10 phosphorylated aa residues by examining RALF1-dependent nuclear accumulation of EBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3C–3K</xref>). We cloned the EBP1 or mEBP1-10A sequences into a <italic>35S</italic> promoter-driven GFP fusion construct and obtained <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> and <italic>mEBP1-10A-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s002">S2D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7D–S7F Fig</xref>) transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2J</xref>, RALF1 promoted EBP1-GFP protein accumulation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). RALF1 also promoted mEBP1-10A-GFP protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s007">S7F Fig</xref>); however, only weak fluorescence was detected in the nucleus, compared with that in unmutated EBP1-GFP plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). DAPI staining and plot profile analysis showed that the enhanced fluorescence of RALF1-treated <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> was mainly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3D–3K</xref>). We performed a nucleus fractionation assay to detect the accumulation of EBP1-GFP and mEBP1-10A-GFP in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3L</xref>). RALF1 treatment increased the content of both EBP1-GFP and mEBP1-10A-GFP in nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3L</xref>). However, a much weaker mEBP1-10A-GFP signal was detected in the nucleus when compared with EBP1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3L</xref>). Further, we simultaneously mutated the three phosphorylation sites (Ser<sup>13</sup>, Thr<sup>15</sup>, and Ser<sup>16</sup>, yielding mEBP1-N3A) located in the N-terminal NLR (N-NLR), the three phosphorylation sites in the middle section (Thr<sup>242</sup>, Thr<sup>243</sup>, and Tyr<sup>245</sup>, yielding mEBP1-M3A), the four sites located in the C-terminal NLR (C-NLR) (Ser<sup>378</sup>, Thr<sup>379</sup>, Ser<sup>387</sup>, and Ser<sup>388</sup>, yielding mEBP1-C4A), or all 10 phosphorylation sites (mEBP1-10A) to alanine residues to constitutively inactivate these phosphorylation sites and incorporated these mutations in the GFP fusion constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). We used an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplast transfection assay to investigate whether these mutant proteins showed altered localization in response to exogenous RALF1 peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Without RALF1 treatment, the WT EBP1-GFP and all mutated versions showed similar nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). After RALF1 treatment for approximately 1 hour, the percentage of cells with nuclear localization of WT EBP1-GFP was increased to 29.2% (approximately twice more as compared to those before RALF1 treatment, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). However, mEBP1-C4A-GFP and mEBP1-10A-GFP did not show significant changes (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) in nuclear localization upon RALF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). mEBP1-N3-GFP and mEBP1-M3-GFP showed approximately 63.5% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 77.7% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) increases in cells with nuclear localization after RALF1 treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). These data suggest that these 10 phosphorylation sites might affect RALF1-induced EBP1 nuclear accumulation to different extents. The C-NLR-associated phosphorylation sites (Ser<sup>378</sup>, Thr<sup>379</sup>, Ser<sup>387</sup>, Ser<sup>388</sup>) seem to be more important for EBP1 nuclear accumulation, consistent with their close proximity to the NLS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). We further examined the effect of mutations in all 10 phosphorylation sites on nuclear accumulation of EBP1 by comparing the average nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) fluorescence ratios of EBP1-GFP and mEBP1-10A-GFP upon RALF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10C–S10E Fig</xref>). The N/C fluorescence ratios were 1.63 for EBP1-GFP and 1.18 for mEBP1-10A-GFP, showing a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s010">S10C–S10E Fig</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>ebp1</italic> mutants, similar to <italic>fer</italic>, display defects in cell growth in different cell types</title>
<p>FER plays a critical role in cell growth, and its function may vary in different cell types as well as in distinct hormonal responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref050">50</xref>].

First, we investigated root elongation inhibition in response to RALF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref023">23</xref>] in plants of various genotypes, including <italic>fer-4</italic>, <italic>ebp1</italic>, <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> and <italic>fer-4/EBP1-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref020">20</xref>], <italic>fer-4</italic> was less sensitive to RALF1 than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Compared to the mock treatment, Col-0 root length was reduced approximately 52.6% in the presence of RALF1 peptide (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas <italic>fer-4</italic> was reduced approximately 13.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The <italic>ebp1</italic> was more sensitive than the WT to RALF1 treatment, as reflected by more severe reduction in root elongation (71.1% for <italic>ebp1-1</italic>, 65.6% for <italic>ebp1-2</italic>, and 75.0% for <italic>ebp1-3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In contrast, <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> was less sensitive to RALF1 than the WT (45.1% inhibition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). An additive phenotype of RALF1 insensitivity in <italic>fer-4/EBP1-GFP</italic> (13.1% inhibition) compared to <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, no significant additive RALF1 insensitivity was observed in <italic>fer-4/EBP1-GFP</italic> relative to <italic>fer-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), suggesting that EBP1 played roles downstream of the RALF1-FER signaling pathway, and EBP1 inhibited RALF1 response in roots. The RALF1 responses in the other <italic>EBP1-OE</italic> lines (<italic>rdr6</italic> background) and <italic>rdr6</italic> control were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), and we found RALF1 had lower sensitivity in the <italic>EBP1-OE</italic> lines than that in the <italic>rdr6</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The <italic>mEBP1-10A-GFP</italic> lines also showed lower sensitivity than that of Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), albeit to a lesser extent than <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, we crossed the <italic>ebp1-1</italic> mutant with plants expressing <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> or <italic>mEBP1-10A-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s013">S13 Fig</xref>) and performed root growth response to RALF1. <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> rescued the <italic>ebp1-1</italic> mutant in the root growth assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s013">S13 Fig</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), showing the functionality of the EBP1-GFP fusion protein. However, compared with EBP1-GFP, mEBP1-10A-GFP only partially complemented the <italic>ebp1-1</italic> mutant phenotype in the same assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s013">S13 Fig</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), again suggesting that the phosphorylation sites are important for EBP1’s role in plants.</p>

<p>A study shows that some RALFs (e.g., RALF23, RALF33, and RALF34) inhibit flg22- or 18 amino acid fragment of bacterial elongation factor Tu (elf18)-triggered ROS bursts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref016">16</xref>]. Here, we checked the RALF1 response in <italic>ebp1</italic> mutant plants using the similar assays. In response to flg22, the WT and <italic>ebp1</italic> mutant plants show a similar level of ROS burst that has been reduced in the <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14A Fig</xref>). When treated with flg22 and RALF1 combined, the ROS burst in the WT was partially inhibited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14A Fig</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), suggesting that RALF1 suppressed flg22-triggered ROS burst. In <italic>ebp1</italic> mutant lines, RALF1 more severely impaired the flg22-triggered ROS burst, again suggesting that <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants were more sensitive to the RALF1 peptide than Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14A Fig</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is another RALF response indicator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref052">52</xref>]. We found that RALF1-induced MAPK activities were higher in <italic>ebp1</italic> mutant lines than in Col-0, further suggesting that <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants are more sensitive to RALF1 peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>RALF1 induces rapid alkalinization of culture media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref018">18</xref>] via the active FER kinase receptor by inhibiting AHA2 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, we measured pH variations in culture medium before and after the addition of RALF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14C and S14D Fig</xref>). Within 10 minutes, RALF1 significantly increased the medium pH in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14D Fig</xref>), similar as reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref018">18</xref>]. The pH values were approximately 7.05, 6.27, 8.22, 7.62, and 7.51 in Col-0, <italic>fer-4</italic>, <italic>ebp1-1</italic>, <italic>ebp1-2</italic>, and <italic>ebp1-3</italic>, respectively, after 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14D Fig</xref>). Because of the subsequent H<sup>+</sup> efflux, the medium pH started to decrease, but the medium pH values of the <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants were still higher than that of Col-0, and the medium pH of the <italic>fer-4</italic> plants was the lowest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14D Fig</xref>), suggesting that RALF1 has strong effects on <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants, in contrast to Col-0 and <italic>fer-4</italic>. As EBP1 affected many aspects of FER function (especially several nonnuclear RALF1 responses, including RALF1-mediated inhibition of flg22-triggered ROS, MAPK phosphorylation, and proton secretion), we tested the possibility that EBP1 might affect <italic>FER</italic> gene expression. We examined <italic>FER</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants and <italic>EBP1-OE</italic> and found that <italic>FER</italic> was up-regulated in <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants and was down-regulated in <italic>EBP1-OE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Taken together, these assays suggested that EBP1 negatively regulates RALF1 response.</p>

<title>EBP1 associates with gene promoters in response to RALF1 signaling</title>
<p>EBP1 is a DNA- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref033">33</xref>] and RNA-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref035">35</xref>] protein. Thus, we wondered whether the RALF1-FER pathway regulates the association of EBP1 with DNA to control gene transcription after its accumulation in the nucleus. First, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to screen EBP1-regulated genes. We prepared RNA-seq libraries using RNAs isolated from 7-DAG Col-0 (with or without RALF1 treatment for 2 hours), <italic>ebp1-1</italic>, and <italic>fer-4</italic> seedlings with three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6A–6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). Comparing Col-0 and <italic>ebp1-1</italic>, we found 367 genes with lower transcript levels and 360 genes with higher transcript levels in the <italic>ebp1-1</italic> mutant plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). These affected genes mainly function in signal transduction (142 genes), transcription events (78 genes), and stress responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s015">S15A Fig</xref>). In <italic>fer-4</italic>, 3,387 genes were affected, with 1,634 and 1,753 genes showing lower or higher mRNA levels than Col-0, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). RALF1 treatment affected approximately 4,007 genes (1,112 genes with lower and 2,895 genes with higher mRNA levels than control) in Col-0 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Using DAVID Functional Annotation tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref053">53</xref>], we also analyzed the functional annotations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of differentially expressed genes between <italic>ebp1-1</italic> and <italic>fer-4</italic> (<italic>ebp1-1</italic> versus <italic>fer-4</italic>) and among <italic>ebp1-1</italic>, <italic>fer-4</italic>, and RALF1-treated Col-0 (<italic>ebp1-1</italic> versus <italic>fer-4</italic> versus RALF1-treated Col-0) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s015">S15B and S15C Fig</xref>). Most of the genes altered in <italic>ebp1-1</italic> versus <italic>fer-4</italic> were related to signal transduction (84 genes), transcription events (41 genes), and stress responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s015">S15B Fig</xref>). Most of the genes altered in <italic>ebp1-1</italic> versus <italic>fer-4</italic> versus RALF1-treated Col-0 played roles in the transcription process (30 genes) or transcription regulation events (31 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s015">S15C Fig</xref>). These results suggested that the EBP1 signaling pathway is related to the RALF1-FER pathway by regulating a subset of overlapping genes.</p>

<p>As a nuclear-localized protein, EBP1 might directly bind to and regulate gene expression. Through RNA-seq analysis, we found that 181 overlapping genes were simultaneously affected among <italic>ebp1-1</italic>, <italic>fer-4</italic>, and RALF1-treated Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). We speculated that target genes are directly bound by EBP1 and regulated by the RALF1-FER-EBP1 signaling pathway. We tested this idea by examining some of these overlapping genes or related genes that have been reported to be regulated by RALF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref054">54</xref>]. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (with RALF1-treated Col-0 seedlings), we screened 17 potential genes (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Methods</xref>) in the context of the information from RNA-seq. We found that DNA fragments from four genes (−213 to +117 of <italic>CML38</italic> gene; −1113 to −844 of <italic>CKX4</italic> gene; −1593 to −1195 of <italic>ERF1B</italic> gene; −2675 to −2397 of <italic>SAUR9</italic> gene) were immunoprecipitated by EBP1 antibody, whereas the adjacent DNA regions were not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s016">S16A–S16H Fig</xref>). We further found that RALF1 treatment enhanced the EBP1 association with these four target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s016">S16I–S16K Fig</xref>). Notably, <italic>CML38</italic> was recently revealed as a downstream target gene of the RALF1-FER signaling pathway, as the <italic>cml38</italic> mutant becomes insensitive to RALF1 peptide in root elongation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus, we further analyzed the <italic>CML38</italic>-detailed motif that was regulated by EBP1 using a candidate DNA screen strategy. Fortunately, we found a CCACGTC motif (−201 to −194 of <italic>CML38</italic>) that was located in the EBP1-immunoprecipitated DNA fragments of the <italic>CML38</italic> gene (−213 to +117) and further confirmed that this motif was bound directly by EBP1 protein in vitro using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). For performing a transient transcription dual-luciferase assay (Dual-LUC), <italic>proCML38</italic>::LUC (combined with the luciferase [LUC] reporter gene fused to the <italic>CML38</italic> promoter containing the CCACGTC motif) and <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>EBP1</italic> vectors were constructed to express <italic>proCML38</italic>-derived LUC and EBP1 protein, respectively, as described in Methods. Using this LUC assay, we confirmed that EBP1 suppressed <italic>CML38</italic> transcription in the protoplasts isolated from Col-0 plants in a RALF1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). <italic>proCML38</italic>::LUC and <italic>35S</italic>::EBP1 were cotransferred into <italic>ebp1-1</italic> mutant, and decreased <italic>proCML38</italic>::LUC activity was shown after RALF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s017">S17 Fig</xref>). In the <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant, lower suppression levels were detected with and without RALF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). We performed qRT-PCR assay to measure <italic>CML38</italic> expression levels in <italic>ebp1</italic> mutant and in plants overexpressing <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic>, respectively, in response to RALF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s018">S18A Fig</xref>). Without RALF1 treatment, <italic>CML38</italic> level is higher in <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants as compared to the Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s018">S18A Fig</xref>). After RALF1 treatment, <italic>CML38</italic> expression was up-regulated in <italic>ebp1</italic> but down-regulated in <italic>EBP1-GFP</italic> when compared with Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s018">S18A Fig</xref>), suggesting that EBP1 inhibits <italic>CML38</italic> gene expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanisms by which RLK regulates mRNA translation in plants cells are largely unknown. The NIK-RPL10-LIMYB pathway may be the only example in which an RLK (e.g., nuclear shuttle protein-interacting receptor-like kinase [NIK]) may regulate the translation process in response to viral infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato. The receptor kinase NIK can interact with the ribosomal protein RPL10 and redirect RPL10 to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref055">55</xref>]. In the nucleus, RPL10 interacts with L10-interacting MYB domain-containing protein (LIMYB) to down-regulate the expression of genes encoding subunits of the translational machinery, leading to global translation suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref056">56</xref>]. In this study, we identified a new regulatory mechanism in which RALF1-FER promotes translation of <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA. A previous study has shown that EBP1 regulates organ growth in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref041">41</xref>], suggesting that the protein abundance of EBP1 is critical for its function and that EBP1 protein levels must be strictly regulated to maintain an optimal level. Our results have shown that, although <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA was transcribed in the absence of RALF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s006">S6H and S6K Fig</xref>), it was translated at a very low level in the root tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2J</xref>). The RALF1-FER signal triggered rapid protein synthesis of EBP1 via increasing <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This phenomenon is reminiscent of a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL), a mechanism that has been well defined in circadian rhythm control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref057">57</xref>] but has rarely been reported in receptor-mediated signaling pathways. The exact mechanism by which RALF1-FER promotes <italic>EBP1</italic> mRNA translation remains unclear. Although we focused on a specific target EBP1 in this report, we cannot exclude the possibility that RALF1-FER may regulate the translation machinery to promote global translation in the cell. In any case, our work provides an example showing that regulation at the level of protein translation may serve as a critical mechanism in signal transduction regulation.</p>
<p>In addition to regulation on translation rate by RALF1-FER pathway, EBP1 protein may be subjected to other control mechanisms to maintain the optimal levels. One such mechanism may involve factors that control the protein stability. An intriguing finding in this study was that EBP1 protein content was higher in the <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant than the WT plants under normal conditions. This seems to contradict the major results that RALF1-FER promotes EBP1 translation, as discussed above. We interpret this result in two possible ways. First, FER may regulate EBP1 protein stability via an unknown mechanism. We performed an in vitro protein degradation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s019">S19A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref058">58</xref>] and found that EBP1-His protein was more stable when incubated with total protein extract from <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant than with Col-0 extract. Furthermore, mEBP1-10A-His was more stable than EBP1-His when incubated with total protein extract from Col-0 in the protein degradation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s019">S19B Fig</xref>). These results suggest that FER might reduce EBP1 protein stability. Secondly, in view of multiple roles of EBP1 in the ABA and salt stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref044">44</xref>], we suggest that EBP1 protein levels may respond to other environmental cues, such as biotic and abiotic stress conditions. As <italic>fer</italic> mutants show stress phenotypes (such as enhanced ABA response), altered stress responses in <italic>fer</italic> mutants may also regulate EBP1 protein levels.</p>
<p>The complexity of the control mechanisms for EBP1 protein abundance in plant cells corresponds to the multifunctional nature of EBP1. We propose here some possible reasons that may explain the observations that EBP1, like FER, plays different, and in some cases opposite, roles in cell growth in different organs. Firstly, some other <italic>Cr</italic>RLK1L family members, such as ANX1 and CVY1, can interact with EBP1 but result in different consequences when compared with FER functions. There are known examples showing that <italic>Cr</italic>RLK1L members play opposite roles in specific tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref059">59</xref>]. The interaction between other <italic>Cr</italic>RLK1Ls with EBP1 may also explain the finding that low levels of EBP1 were still detected in the nuclear fraction in RALF1-treated <italic>fer-4</italic> roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). Secondly, in addition to the response to RALF1 in root growth regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref020">20</xref>], FER also responds to other RALF family peptides (such as RALF17, RALF23, and RALF33) to regulate different or opposite cellular activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref016">16</xref>]. This assumption is further supported by studies showing that one <italic>Cr</italic>RLK1L can sense distinct RALF members to fulfill an opposite function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref061">61</xref>].</p>
<p>During signal transduction, RLKs often directly interact with proteins in the plasma membrane or cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref062">62</xref>]. The mechanisms by which RLKs regulate nuclear events often involve a number of steps through the cytoplasm. BR insensitivity 1 (BRI1)/BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) RLKs regulate Brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1)/<italic>bri1</italic>-EMS-suppressor 1 (BES1) phosphorylation status and their accumulation in the nucleus through the <italic>bri1</italic>-suppressor 1 (BSU1)-BR insensitive 2 (BIN2) phosphorylation cascade, serving as a good paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref062">62</xref>]. In contrast to this paradigm, however, we found that FER may directly phosphorylate and enhance the nuclear accumulation of EBP1, a transcriptional regulator, in response to RALF1 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We suggest that this novel mechanism of RLKs directly interacting with and phosphorylating a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein might represent a rapid and effective strategy in response to extracellular signals to control nuclear events, although similar mechanisms have rarely been identified in RLK regulation. In the future, experimental work needs to be done at structural and biochemical levels to address the question of how FER in plants and EGFR in animals share a similar substrate, EBP1, to transmit the signal from the cell surface to the nucleus.</p>
<p>As a nuclear-localized protein, EBP1 may bind to and thus regulate gene transcription in the nucleus. In this study, we showed that EBP1 binds to the promoter region and inhibited the expression of <italic>CML38</italic>, which has been shown to play a role in RALF1-induced inhibition of root elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref054">54</xref>]. When <italic>CML38</italic> function is disrupted in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, RALF1 peptide fails to inhibit root growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref054">54</xref>]. However, <italic>CML38</italic> may not be sufficient to count for all RALF-regulated cellular activities. Indeed, except for <italic>CML38</italic>, EBP1 has many other targets (e.g., <italic>CKX4</italic>) that may be relevant in RALF1-regulated processes such as extracellular alkalinization. Additionally, mutations in EBP1 may affect the expression of some signaling components in the RALF1-FER pathway. In support of this assumption, we found that <italic>FER</italic> was up-regulated in <italic>ebp1</italic> mutants but was down-regulated in <italic>EBP1-OE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006340.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The altered level of <italic>FER</italic> expression may thus, at least in part, explain why <italic>ebp1</italic> plants showed altered responses to RALF1 in nonnuclear events, such as the RALF1-mediated inhibition of flg22-triggered ROS, MAPK phosphorylation, and proton secretion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006340.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). Further work is needed to identify EBP1 target genes at the whole-genome level by, for example, ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays to further address the broad function of EBP1. At the posttranscriptional level, EBP1 has been identified as a part of RNP complexes and can bind to RNA directly in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref035">35</xref>]. One example showed that EBP1 binds to mRNA and regulates its translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006340.ref039">39</xref>]. In the plant kingdom, whether EBP1 also regulates RNA-related events such as mRNA translation, mRNA alternative splicing, or mRNA decay remains an open question.</p>
