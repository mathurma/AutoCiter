      <abstract>
        <p>The Rho family of GTPases control actin organization during diverse cellular responses (migration, cytokinesis and endocytosis). Although the primary members of this family (RhoA, Rac and Cdc42) have different downstream effects on actin remodeling, the basic mechanism involves targeting to the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. Our hypothesis is that the details of GTPase cycling between membrane and cytosol are key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches. Accordingly, we developed a modeling framework to analyze experimental data for these systems. This analysis can reveal details of GDI-mediated cycling and help distinguish between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and direct association-dissociation of GTPase with membrane molecules. Analysis of experimental data for Rac membrane cycling reveals that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. Non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTPase are presented in multidimensional charts. This methodology is then used to analyze glucose stimulated Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells. The charts are used to illustrate the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane bound GTPase. In a similar fashion, the charts can be used as a guide in assessing how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Among the functions of the small GTPases Rac, RhoA and Cdc42 are the regulation of protein traffic, insulin secretion, cell shape, survival and motility. The last two are important steps for tumor growth and metastasis. The function of these proteins relies on their expression levels, proper membrane localization and activation. In addition, all three proteins compete for the same protein ‘GDI’, which modulates their cycling. These proteins are ubiquitous in mammalian cells, but also studied in simpler <italic>in vitro</italic> systems and cultured yeast. Here we show, using a series of computational analyses, that for each of these experimental systems the dominant pathway for membrane cycling of GTPases seems to differ. This means that the researcher interested in the physiological function of any of those proteins must make sure that the experimental system is appropriate. We present a methodology to identify the dominant pathways by measuring the apparent membrane dissociation rate of the protein as a function of GDI concentration. We provide charts generated from parametric scans. This analysis is then applied to the Rac-dependent insulin secretion pathway in pancreatic ß-cells, revealing that direct signaling between Rac and the membrane is an essential mechanism that emerges from the data.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The activity of small GTPases RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1 are controlled by spatial localization, nucleotide binding, and binding to Rho <underline>g</underline>uanine nucleotide <underline>d</underline>issociation <underline>i</underline>nhibitor (GDI). The importance of these three GTPases for cytoskeleton organization, cell migration and polarization is well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-EtienneManneville1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Bustelo1">[3]</xref> and up/down regulation of GDI has been linked to metastatic and chemoresistant cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Zhao1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Harding1">[5]</xref>. The spatial localization of these three GTPases is important for activation by membrane bound <underline>g</underline>uanine nucleotide <underline>e</underline>xchange <underline>f</underline>actors (GEF), which promote GTPase release of GDP and binding to GTP; the GTP state activates and/or recruits effectors at the membrane, producing the downstream actin-mediated cellular response. The <underline>G</underline>TPase <underline>a</underline>ctivating <underline>p</underline>roteins (GAP) bind to the active GTPases and promote conversion of the nucleotide GTP into GDP, inactivating the GTPase. Binding to GDI promotes relocation of the GTPases from the membrane to the cytosol, inhibits interaction with effectors and inhibits exchange between GDP and GTP bound states (for more detailed review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-DerMardirossian1">[6]</xref>). In other words, the ratio between GEF/GAP activities determines the fraction of membrane bound GTPases that is available to interact with the effectors, while the interaction with GDI regulates the amount of GTPases available for activation. Another potential function of GDI is to protect the cytosolic fraction of GTPase from degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Boulter1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The interactions between GDI's and GTPases can be regulated, modulating the cycling for spatial and temporal localization. For example, the affinities between GDI and GTPases may depend on nucleotide state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Sasaki1">[8]</xref>, experimental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Forget1">[9]</xref>, post-translational modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Michaelson1">[10]</xref>, phosphorylation state of GTPases and GDI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-DerMardirossian2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref>, sometimes resulting in translocation of the inactive GDI (that cannot bind GTPase) to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-DerMardirossian2">[11]</xref>. The dependence of nucleotide state on GTPase membrane affinity has been studied via constructs mimicking its constitutively active and inactive forms. In yeast, it has been proposed that the cycling between active and inactive form also impacts the solubility of Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-WedlichSoldner1">[13]</xref>. However, the constitutively active mutant Q61L used in this study seems to very poorly interact with GDI <italic>in vivo</italic> in comparison to <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Michaelson2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Lin1">[16]</xref>. In addition, the lipid composition of membranes can shift the GTPase population from cytosolic GDI-bound to membrane bound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-McDonald1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Ugolev1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As a further complication, the delivery and removal of GTPases from the membrane may also be independent of GDI. Mutants of Rac and Cdc42 that are unable to bind to GDI successfully promote membrane ruffling and actin reorganization in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Gandhi1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Gibson1">[20]</xref>. Studies in polarized yeast indicate vesicular trafficking as an rdi1 (the GDI in yeast) independent mechanism for delivery of GTPase to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Slaughter1">[21]</xref>. However, numerical analysis revealed that vesicular traffic alone will only result in GTPase polarization if there is a yet unknown mechanism for Cdc42 concentration in the trafficking vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Layton1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A second GDI independent mechanism was revealed by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments from Cerione's group. Cdc42 dissociates from the membrane at the same rate, whether in presence or absence of GDI; about 10% of RacGDP is translocated from the lipid membranes to the soluble fraction in absence of GDI, in contrast to negligible amounts for RacGTP or Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>. Similar results for Rac were obtained in control experiments against different GDI constructs and Sf9 cell membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-DerMardirossian2">[11]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments on cultured fibroblasts also highlight that the removal rate of Rac from the membrane in those cells is not dependent on GDI. The Rac apparent membrane dissociation rate: a) is independent of GDI expression levels; b) is independent of spatial localization (protusive vs. quiescent regions); c) is dependent on nucleotide state; d) the reduced dissociation rate for active Rac is not due to elevated signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>. In contrast, in cultured yeast, rdi1 promotes the fastest mechanism of Cdc42 membrane removal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Slaughter1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to integrate and reconcile these different observations, in this work we computationally analyze the mechanisms by which GTPases can be removed from and delivered to the membrane, estimating their relative contributions. To achieve this we initially developed a ‘lumped’ model that allows us to readily compare GDI-mediated and GDI-independent GTPase cycling. Simulation results over a wide range of parameters are conveniently displayed as contour plots. These charts serve as a visual tool to evaluate the effect of modifying the affinities between GTPases and membrane or GDI on the GTPase membrane bound fraction. The parameters of the lumped model reveal the function of GDI in GTPase cycling. We also develop an analysis of the role of vesicle trafficking in the mechanism for GTPase cycling in yeast. We then present a more detailed model for GTPase membrane cycling, explicitly accounting for the nucleotide state and interaction with effector proteins. This model permits us to derive all the rate constants involved in Rac cycling, from experimental data on cultured fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>. The functional form and parameters extracted for Rac cycling are consistent with the role of crosstalk, as emphasized by Burridge and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Boulter1">[7]</xref>. In order to illustrate the importance of identifying such parameters in vivo, we analyze Rac membrane translocation in glucose stimulated β-cells. The analysis suggests that 2 mechanisms must be contributing to the delivery of Rac to the membrane: phosphorylation-mediated downregulation of the affinity between Rac and GDI and an increase in affinity between Rac and the membrane, possibly via lipid signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Jayaram1">[24]</xref>. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the Rho-GTPase cycling can access qualitatively diverse pathways in different cellular systems or through different experimental manipulations.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The overarching theme of the results we describe below is that the canonical Rho GTPase signaling relay can operate differently in different experimental and/or biological contexts. We divided our analysis of Rho GTPase cycling into subsections that describe individual mechanisms and then how they may be integrated. The common methodology used in each of the first three sections is the identification of non-dimensional groups and characterization of the system based on such variables. This methodology leads to a collective set of results correlating the parameters and variables of interest and identify regimes where a reduced system is valid. Sections Detailed Model and Example respectively apply these analyses to understand published data on Rac cycling and to make predictions on Rac cycling in an unexplored cellular system.

      <p>In Section Vesicle traffic we first discuss this GDI independent cycling mechanism. We show that vesicle traffic occurs at much slower rates than GDI mediated membrane dissociation of GTPases. However, it has been hypothesized that localized traffic may contribute to polarized membrane distribution of GTPase, as in budding yeast. We present a dimensional analysis of the parameters involved in GTPase distribution in yeast and compare our analysis to recently published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Slaughter1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Layton1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that <italic>in vitro</italic> GTPases dissociate from membranes in absence of GDI at rates that may be as fast as in presence of GDI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>. In the Section GDI and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> we analyze the contribution of GDI mediated and independent mechanisms to the apparent membrane dissociation rate of GTPases. We identify parametric regions where the apparent membrane dissociation rate is insensitive to GDI concentrations. This demonstrates the importance of considering the parametric region corresponding to a physiological system of interest.</p>
      <p>The relative contributions of GDI dependent vs. independent cycling will also impact the fraction of GTPase at the membrane, a common experimental observable. In addition, a fraction of the membrane bound GTPase may be inert due to interaction with GDI. The analysis of the fraction of GTPase associated with the membrane is therefore the focus of Section Lumped model. We find that the kinetic rates of a simplified model can be lumped into the non-dimensional parameter <italic>ρ<sub>Eq</sub></italic>, representing the degree of contribution of GDI to the membrane cycling of the GTPase. The results of this model are presented in charts, to visualize GTPase distribution as a function of GDI concentration and affinities between GTPase and GDI, and GTPase and membrane.</p>
      <p>However, in order to use these charts, one must know the parameter <italic>ρ<sub>Eq</sub></italic> and the regions of the chart that applies to the system of interest. In the Section Detailed model we build a model which includes nucleotide cycling. This model is the most appropriate for extraction of kinetic parameters. It successfully reproduces the cycling of Rac in NIH3T3 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, in the Section Example we illustrate another application of this modeling framework. We use the results from the Sections Lumped model and Detailed model to analyze the glucose stimulated Rac redistribution in pancreatic β-cells.</p>

        <title>Vesicle traffic</title>
        <p>GTPases have been shown to localize to vesicles, and endocytosis and exocytosis can be considered as potential pathways to regulate the amount of GTPase at the plasma membrane. Proteins that are tightly bound to membranes are trafficked by fusion and scission of vesicles only. But small GTPases are able to diffuse in the cytosol, which therefore constitutes an alternative mechanism.</p>
        <p>The first question we ask is: which is the fastest pathway for plasma membrane bound GTPases to reach the vesicular membrane? a) via endocytosis, or b) via dissociation from the plasma membrane, cytosolic diffusion (usually bound to GDI) and finally binding to the vesicle membrane. A simple argument demonstrates that cytosolic diffusion is the likely dominant pathway. For mammalian and yeast cells, recycling rates of membrane due to endocytosis lie on the timescale of 10<sup>−4</sup>/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Layton1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Alberts1">[31]</xref>. This number is obtained multiplying the rate of endocytosis (number of vesicles per time) times surface area of a single vesicle divided by the surface area of plasma membrane. Note that the GDI dependent removal of GTPase from the membrane is on the order of 10<sup>−2</sup>/s or higher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Slaughter1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>. This means that the kinetic term for traffic becomes important only if the concentration of GTPase in vesicles is at least one order of magnitude higher than in the plasma membrane. By conservation of membrane area, exocytosis is expected to have contributions of the same time scale as endocytosis when traffic is evenly distributed along the plasma membrane. This analysis in confirmed by a more detailed computational model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Savage1">[32]</xref>. This means that if a vesicle is able to sustain higher concentration of GTPase (molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>) than the plasma membrane, either the dissociation rate of GTPase from the vesicle to the cytosol is lower than from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, or the association rate from the cytosol to the vesicle is higher than to the plasma membrane. The lipid composition of the vesicular membrane, for example, may promote the higher affinity for GTPase. But this analysis assumes that the plasma membrane has uniform vesicle trafficking. So a second question may now be posed: can localized delivery, as may pertain in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Slaughter1">[21]</xref>, of vesicles with high concentration of GTPases generate a concentration polarization on the plasma membrane?</p>
        <p>The answer depends on the balance of three rates: a) the net rate of delivery of vesicles to a localized region of the membrane (delivery window); b) the diffusion of GTPase to the other regions of the plasma membrane; and c) the removal rate out of the delivery window. The only mechanism fighting against polarization is the lateral diffusion of GTPase in the membrane. Using dimensional analysis, we now show that even if the rate for localized delivery of GTPases is infinitely high, the concentration gradient can only be sustained if the removal rate (out of the delivery window) is high enough to overcome the effect of lateral diffusion.</p>
        <p>The parameters necessary for the analysis are the characteristic length of the delivery window <italic>L<sub>w</sub></italic>, the characteristic length of the system <italic>L</italic>, the net delivery rate in the window <italic>h<sub>w</sub></italic>, the delivery rate out of the window <italic>h</italic>, the first order rate constant for removal from the membrane outside of the window <italic>m</italic> and the lateral diffusion coefficient of the GTPase in the membrane <italic>D<sub>iff</sub></italic>. These parameters are lumped into two non-dimensional numbers <italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002831.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002831.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002831.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002831.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula><italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic> represents the ratio between localized and global delivery of proteins. <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic> represents the ratio between the rate of removal of protein from the membrane and its membrane diffusive flux. The equation for conservation of mass for the non-dimensionalized concentration of GTPase at the membrane <italic>c<sup>*</sup></italic> is a function of these two ratios:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002831.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002831.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>The boundary condition for flux normal to the interface with the delivery window is −1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref> and Eqs. S1–S7 for details). When <italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic>&lt;&lt;1, the localized delivery is insufficient to generate a gradient regardless of <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic>. However, <italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic>→∞ is not sufficient to maintain a concentration gradient. It is also necessary that <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic> is on the order of 1 or larger. The solution for the 1D problem is plotted in Fig. S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>A series of numerical simulations of a model considering stochastic vesicle traffic in polarized yeast have been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Layton1">[22]</xref>, corresponding to the same problem in spherical coordinates. This study assumed negligible delivery outside of the window (<italic>h = 0,ρ<sub>del</sub></italic>→∞), and the reference value for <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic> was on the order of 10<sup>−1</sup> (<italic>m</italic> = 1.7×10<sup>−4</sup>, and the characteristic length of the cell is its diameter, <italic>L</italic> = 5 µm). The simulations were performed considering <italic>m</italic> to be due to vesicle endocytosis alone. Increasing the net delivery rate <italic>h<sub>w</sub></italic> (via concentration on exocytic vesicles or frequency of exocytosis) increased the membrane concentration of Cdc42, but did not sustain polarization at steady state. This is consistent with the fact that <italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic> remained unchanged (<italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic>→∞). However, polarization became noticeable as <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic> is increased by one order of magnitude (via decreased <italic>D<sub>iff</sub></italic> or increased endocytosis from membrane regions outside the window).</p>
        <p>In contrast, <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic> values based on iFRAP measurements in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Slaughter1">[21]</xref> range from 13 to 150 (removal rates <italic>m</italic> ranges from 0.02 to 0.22 s<sup>−1</sup>). The lowest value corresponds to experimental conditions that completely eliminate the contribution of rdi1 mediated cycling to <italic>m</italic>. Polarization does occur, consistent with the size of the parameter <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic>. It is important to note that mutations abrogating the binding between Cdc42 and rdi1 still resulted in <italic>m</italic> values two orders of magnitude higher than that estimated to be due to endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Layton1">[22]</xref>, suggesting that direct dissociation of Cdc42 from the membrane dominates under these conditions. Thus, our analysis shows that the measured values of <italic>m</italic> in polarized yeast are sufficient to generate a gradient in Cdc42 concentration. The simulations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Layton1">[22]</xref> confirm that if the removal rate <italic>m</italic> is due to vesicle traffic alone, no polarity is established. However, polarity would be facilitated by considering the removal rate due to a third mechanism that is rdi1 and vesicle independent. This possibility has not been explored in yeast so far.</p>
        <p>This short analysis is built on top of the series of detailed models that have contributed to understanding yeast polarity. The new insight is that we reveal the two non-dimensional numbers that dictate the behavior of the system, <italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic>. There is a single solution for <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002831.e003">equation (3)</xref> for a given pair <italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic>. However, there is an infinite combination of parameters that would result in the same pair <italic>ρ<sub>del</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>rem</sub></italic>.</p>

        <p>Membrane dissociation of GTPases via an unexpected rdi1 (or GDI) independent mechanism that occurs much faster than vesicle traffic would not be unique for Cdc42 in yeast.

        <p>The common observation for all experiments is that increased GDI concentration results in decreased fraction of GTPase at the membrane. The question we ask is whether GDI accelerates the removal rate of GTPase from the membrane (as shown for Cdc42 in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-WedlichSoldner1">[13]</xref>) or simply acts as a buffer, preventing the binding of GTPase to the membrane (as proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>). The measurable quantity that will help answer this question for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments is the apparent membrane dissociation rate of GTPase <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>.</p>
        <p>We can assess the relative contributions of the GDI-independent and dependent membrane dissociation mechanisms to <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> by analyzing experiments in which GDI concentrations and effector protein concentrations are varied. If the experiments reveal increased <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> with increased GDI concentration, then the complex GTPase-GDI represents a significant pathway for membrane removal of GTPase. Even if the membrane dissociation rates for free and GDI-bound GTPase are identical (as shown in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments for Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>), by increasing the concentration of effector proteins, a dependence of <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> on GDI concentration should become explicit (Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>). In contrast, the independence of the <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> on GDI concentration would reveal that the primary mechanism of removal of GTPase from the membrane is GDI independent.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> the GTPase binds or unbinds the membrane while free or bound to GDI.

The dependence of <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> on membrane dissociation rates <italic>k<sub>2−</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>4−</sub></italic> (for membrane bound GTPase in complex with GDI or free, respectively) and GDI concentration:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002831.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002831.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>Where the small RhoGTPase is represented by <italic>Rho</italic>, <italic>Eff</italic> represents the effector proteins, binding between two proteins is represented by a dot, and the subscript <italic>m</italic> represents membrane bound species.</p>

We call it ‘parameter’ rather than ‘constant’ since the rates can be modulated during signaling. Because the fastest membrane dissociation rate is believed to be GDI mediated, it is convenient to look at the non-dimensional ratio <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>2−</sub></italic> This is equivalent to normalizing <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> relative to its maximal value in the presence of saturating GDI. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows a plot of <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub>/k<sub>2−</sub></italic> as a function of the ratio between concentration of free GDI and <italic>K<sub>D1</sub></italic> for several values of concentration of effector protein divided by <italic>K<sub>D5</sub></italic>. Changes in GDI expression levels are showed in the x-axis. Increased concentrations of effector proteins are depicted by different curves (or alternatively, increased affinity between GTPase and effector protein, due GTPase activation). For this example, the GDI independent dissociation rate was taken as one half the GDI mediated dissociation (<italic>k<sub>4−</sub></italic> = 0.5 <italic>k<sub>2−</sub></italic>); as shown in the supplementary material, this assumption does not affect the qualitative arguments developed here (Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows that the maximum <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> equals <italic>k<sub>2−</sub></italic> when the membrane bound population of GTPase is all GDI bound. In the absence of effector proteins (or for a GTPase unable to bind the latter), <italic>k<sub>offAP</sub></italic> cannot be reduced below <italic>k<sub>4−</sub></italic> (dashed line). This limiting value is reached either when the concentration of GDI is negligible, or the probability of the membrane bound GTPase to bind GDI is negligible. Importantly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> reveals that <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> can remain unchanged over a wide range of GDI expression levels when the membrane bound GTPase is either all bound to GDI (<italic>K<sub>D1</sub>&lt;&lt;GDI</italic>), or, at the other extreme, has negligible affinity for GDI (shaded region)Interestingly, and somewhat counterintuitively, in the regime where <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> is sensitive to GDI (<italic>K<sub>D1</sub></italic>≅<italic>GDI</italic>), increasing the concentration of effector proteins will accentuate this sensitivity. One extreme case is when the membrane dissociation rates for GDI free or bound GTPase are identical (as shown for Cdc42 <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>). As shown in Fig. S3a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>, in absence of effector proteins, increasing or decreasing the GDI concentration will not perturb <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>. However, for higher levels of effector proteins, <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> will be sensitive to GDI concentrations, in the concentration range <italic>GDI</italic>≅<italic>K<sub>D1</sub></italic>.</p>
        <p>Data for <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> vs. <italic>GDI</italic> will help identify which region of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> pertains to the experimental conditions and the regime within which the particular GTPase operates. Such experiments can be developed by expressing different amounts of GDI, effector proteins, or mutants that will result in different affinities between GTPase and GDI or effector proteins. An immediate application of this analysis is the specific example of Rac in NIH3T3 cells, using the experimental data published by Moissoglu and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>. These experiments are further described in the Section Detailed model. Briefly, wild type (wt) Rac or the constitutively active G12VRac were co-expressed with different levels of GDI in cultured NIH3T3 cells, and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> was measured. The experimental results show that <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> is independent of GDI concentrations both for constitutively active or wild type Rac However, the <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> in cells expressing G12VRac was tenfold lower than in cells expressing wt Rac. Expression of G12VRac would produce similar behavior as activation or overexpression of a GEF, since both conditions result in increased net affinity between the GTPase and effector proteins. The region of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> that reproduces both the independence on GDI concentration and dependence on GTPase activity level is highlighted by the shaded box. We do not know the <italic>k<sub>2−</sub></italic> for this system, so it is not clear whether <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> or one of the other plots in Fig. S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref> would be the best representation of the experiment. However, all show the same progression of <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> as the effector activity increases in the region <italic>K<sub>D1</sub></italic>&gt;&gt;<italic>GDI</italic>. This example will be revisited in Section Detailed model. The analysis suggests that the physiological range that describes Rac cycling in NIH3T3 cells corresponds to <italic>K<sub>D1</sub></italic>&gt;&gt;<italic>GDI</italic> and the function of GDI in this system is to act as a buffer, rather than accelerate the extraction of Rac from the membrane.</p>

        <title>Lumped model: membrane interactions between GTPases and GDI</title>
        <p>The relative contribution of GDI free and bound GTPase to membrane cycling will also have consequences on the fraction of GTPase at the membrane. The main purpose of this section is to provide charts that relate membrane fraction of GTPases, the two cycling mechanisms and GDI concentrations. The results presented here will be used in the Section Example. We next build a model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>., which is appropriate for biological systems where both GDI mediated and independent mechanisms contribute to GTPase cycling. It can be used to assess how GDI activity, affinities between GTPases and GDI, or GTPases and membrane, each affect the fraction of GTPase that is membrane bound. Using the model, one can also predict how changes in the rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>., either due to experimental manipulation or cell regulatory mechanisms, affect the translocation of the GTPase. The main issue is that it is not always possible to measure all the rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. However, we show that the eight rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> can be replaced by only 3 parameters at thermodynamic equilibrium. These three parameters will uniquely determine two variables of interest: the fraction of GTPase at the membrane, and the fraction that is also free from GDI. The results are reported in the contour plots <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2</xref> (and Fig. S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>). Because the solution is uniquely determined, any three measurements out of the five observables (three parameters plus two variables), will allow us to extract the remaining two unknowns.</p>

        <p>The quantities of interest are the fraction of total GTPase bound to the membrane <italic>r0</italic>, and the fraction of GTPase at the membrane and free from GDI, <italic>r0<sub>f</sub></italic>. They consist of ratios between the number of molecules at the membrane and total amount of GTPase in the cell (membrane plus cytosol). At thermodynamic equilibrium (a more restrictive condition than just steady state), the principle of detailed balance dictates that each reaction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> must have identical flux as its reverse reaction.

For a system in equilibrium, measurement of any three of these will determine the remaining two. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Figure 2</xref> (and Fig. S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>) shows the contour plots representing <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002831.e014">Eq.(14)</xref> for ρ<italic><sub>Eq</sub></italic> ranging from 0 to 10. Essentially, ρ<italic><sub>Eq</sub></italic> measures the extent to which GDI directly affects membrane-associated events in the overall mechanism of GTPase cycling. The upper contour corresponds to 9% fraction at the membrane, while the lowest line represents 89%. Each pair of neighboring lines is 10% apart in membrane fraction. When ρ<italic><sub>Eq</sub></italic> = 0, all membrane bound GTPase is free from GDI (<italic>r0</italic> = <italic>r0<sub>f</sub></italic>). The total fraction of GTPase at the membrane <italic>r0</italic> is represented by the dashed lines when ρ<italic><sub>Eq</sub></italic>&gt;0. Note that <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> is inversely proportional to GDI concentration (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002831.e006">equations 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002831.e008">8</xref>). Decreased <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> (high GDI concentrations) results in larger deviations between <italic>r0</italic> and <italic>r0<sub>f</sub></italic>, increasing the amount of inert GTPase (GDI bound) at the membrane (difference between solid and dashed lines). These series of plots shows that in biological systems with large values of ρ<italic><sub>Eq</sub></italic> there is a large pool of inactive membrane bound GTPase due to interaction with GDI.</p>
        <p>Clearly, a cell can utilize many mechanisms to modulate the reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> (i.e. phosphorylation at several sites of GTPase or GDI, nucleotide state, lipid composition and/or post-translational modifications). The contours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2</xref> (and Fig. S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>) indicate the direction in parameter space that will produce the largest change in the membrane fractions <italic>r0</italic> and <italic>r0<sub>f</sub></italic>.</p>
        <p>As noted above, according to the principle of detailed balance, which pertains to systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, there can be no net flux through a cyclic reaction path; this dictates that <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic> = <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic>. For systems that do not reach thermodynamic equilibrium, the disparity between the coefficients <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic> offer further insights into the role of GDI. Detailed balance does not need to hold in live cells, due to dynamic modulation of affinities (via phosphorylation states, membrane composition, etc…) or other factors that may perturb the system (production, degradation or other interactions). Nevertheless, significant deviations from the equilibrium implies that substantial energy needs to be fed into the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Qian1">[37]</xref>. Steady state may still be achieved, however with a net flux through the cycle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. The direction of the flux is determined by the second law of thermodynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Qian2">[38]</xref>. When <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic>, the net flux flows clockwise, and GDI is promoting the removal of GTPase from the membrane. When <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>&lt;<italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic>, it flows counterclockwise and GDI is promoting the delivery of GTPase to the membrane. Solving Eqs.(S14) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref> for steady state will allow for generation of contour plots as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2</xref> (and Fig. S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>). However, knowledge of the association and dissociation rates becomes necessary.</p>
        <p>In summary, quantification of the relationship between <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic> will determine the role of GDI in the system of interest. It is expected that during the short term response to a signal, the cell generates an inequality between <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>, using the GDI to promote delivery or removal of GTPase from the membrane. However, due to energetic cost, any long lived response to a given stimulus is most likely to be well described by detailed balance, where <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic> = <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>.</p>

        <title>Detailed model: nucleotide and GDI dependent membrane cycling</title>
        <p>In order to use the results presented in the previous section, we must identify which chart is appropriate for the system of interest. Therefore, in this section, we use a detailed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) that includes nucleotide state and use it to extract kinetic parameters for RhoGTPase cycling. We apply this model to the experiments by Moissoglu and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>. Using the analysis developed in the Section GDI and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>, we test the simplifying assumption that the main pathway for the membrane dissociation of Rac is GDI independent. Accordingly, the parameter values are optimized for this simplified model. But it is important to emphasize that the success of any parametric search depends on how well the topology of the model reproduces the system of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Chen1">[39]</xref>. Meaning that no matter how extensive the parametric search, an oversimplified system of equations will fail to reproduce the experiments. The simplification prior to optimization is necessary for two main reasons. First, the number of data points must be greater than the number of unknowns. Second, if the model includes reactions with negligible impact on observables an infinite number of parametric solutions will result in the same observable, making the parametric set of the model ‘non-identifiable’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Chen1">[39]</xref>. Thus, the analytical study of Section GDI and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> serves as a guide for building a model that is consistent with experimental observations. The model is verified by the success of the parametric optimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The next step is validation. It consists of comparing the output of the model to experimental data that have not been used in the parametric search. We compare the results of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) with key features of GTPase systems: activation of GTPases (increased GEF activity) promotes translocation of GTPase to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Ugolev1">[18]</xref>; increased GDI results in removal of GTPase from the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Michaelson2">[14]</xref>; depletion of GDI results in increased activity levels of GTPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Boulter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Bielek1">[40]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Moissoglu and colleagues developed a photobleaching method applied to live NIH3T3 cells in combination with a mathematical model in order to extract the dissociation rate of GFP-Rac from the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>. Briefly, photobleaching of the whole cell exclusive of a narrow area at the edge was performed; the fluorescence decay in the unbleached area provided a measure of GFP-Rac dissociation and diffusion. The diffusion coefficient for GTPase in the membrane was extracted by repeating the experiments with different widths of unbleached region. The change in fluorescent GFP-Rac was used to compute the GTPase membrane dissociation rate constants (<italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>), corrected for membrane diffusion. The detailed error analysis of the method is further explored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Novak1">[36]</xref>. Experiments were performed for cells expressing two forms of GFP-Rac: of the wild type (wt) and a constitutively active (G12V) mutant. The experiments were repeated for cells co-expressed with different amounts of GDI. The experimental data reveals plots of <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> versus GDI concentration (similar to the one presented in Section GDI and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>), showing that the <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> in this system is completely independent of GDI expression levels. However, co-expression of wt and a GEF decreases <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>; in cells expressing G12V the <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> is further decreased by one order of magnitude compared to cells expressing wt.</p>
        <p>These results are consistent with our analysis in Section GDI and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> (see shaded area of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). An additional complication is that the membrane dissociation rates for GDP or GTP bound Rac does not need to be identical. In fact, the cell could benefit from having the active GTPase remain at the membrane for longer time than the inactive. As a consequence, <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> may be further decreased due to the combined effect of increased affinity for effector proteins and decreased net dissociation rate. We allow the dissociation rates for GTPase bound to GDP or GTP to be different in the parametric search. The fact that GDI was not found in the membrane fraction of NIH3T3 cells reinforces the conclusion that the system is cycling under the conditions (<italic>GDI</italic>/<italic>K<sub>D1</sub></italic>)∼0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>.</p>
        <p>We now describe the model. RhoGTPases that are at the membrane and not associated with GDI, cycle between the active GTP bound and inactive GDP bound states due to GEFs and GAPs. Cytosolic GAP activity has also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Geiszt1">[41]</xref>. The GTPase bound to either nucleotide is subject to the reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1A:</xref> it may bind to GDI while at the membrane or in the cytosol, and the GTPase or complex GTPase-GDI binds and unbinds the membrane. When the GTPase is membrane bound, active and free from GDI, it may bind to effectors. Based on the discussion above and in Section GDI and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic>, we neglect the reactions associated with the Rho-GDI in the membrane (the dashed reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>.), and check if this topology is a good representation of the system.

Eight experimental conditions were considered and are labeled here as follows: ‘wt’ corresponds to transfection of GFP-wtRac; ‘wt+tiam’, GFP-wtRac cotransfected with the GEF Tiam1; ‘wt+GDI’, GFP-wtRac cotransfected with GDI; ‘wt−GDI’, GFP-wtRac in GDI knockdown cells, and the same four experimental conditions repeated for GFP-G12VRac (constitutively active) transfection instead of GFP-wtRac are labeled ‘G12V’, ‘G12V+tiam’, ‘G12V+GDI’ and ‘G12V−GDI’ respectively. Measurements of total active GFP-Rac were normalized by the result for the control experiment ‘wt’. The cells were reported to have a surface to volume ratio of 0.524/µm.</p>
        <p>Model simplifications and the methodology used for the parametric search are presented in the supporting material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>The model (solid arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) is able to reproduce the quantitative behaviors of cycling and activation of Rac in cultured NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), thus validating the model. We find the membrane dissociation rate for Rac-GDP to be one order of magnitude higher than for active Rac. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g003">Figure 3</xref> corresponds to cells with endogenous GDI concentrations of 0.14 µM, GFP-Rac of 0.05 µM, total effector concentration 0.5 µM, basal membrane GEF/GAP is 1.9, with 3.25 fold increase by Tiam. The ratio between the dissociation constants between cytosolic GDI and cytosolic Rac bound to GDP versus bound to GTP is 0.99. This value differs from what has been previously reported in experiments performed using solution of low ionic strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Sasaki1">[8]</xref>; however, the importance of physiological ionic strength in measurements of GDI-RhoGTPase binding has been demonstrated in similar systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Forget1">[9]</xref>. The dissociation parameter between cytosolic Rac and GDI is 1.3×10<sup>−4</sup> µM. The association rate between Rac and the membrane is 2.84/s and dissociation rates between GDP and GTP bound Rac and the membrane are 0.15/s and 0.011/s, respectively. Note however, that free (unbound to GDI) Rac seems to be tightly bound to the membrane (with membrane dissociation parameter between 0.004 and 0.05). The effective dissociation constants between cytosolic GDI and active or inactive membrane bound Rac are also one order of magnitude apart ((<italic>R<sub>3−,T</sub> R<sub>4+,T</sub></italic>)/(<italic>R<sub>3+,T</sub> R<sub>4−,T</sub></italic>) = 34 nM and (<italic>R<sub>3−,D</sub> R<sub>4+,D</sub></italic>)/(<italic>R<sub>3+,D</sub> R<sub>4−,D</sub></italic>) = 2.5 nM, respectively), and within the range measured for Cdc42 (1–30 nM), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Nomanbhoy1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Nomanbhoy2">[43]</xref>. The parameters derived from the remarkable fits between experiment and model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, serve as a basis for our further exploration of the Rho GTPase system. Further results can be found in the supporting material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>While these parameters are within the expected physiological range, it is important to caution that they are somewhat sensitive to the basal GEF/GAP activities as well as the intracellular concentrations of endogenous GDI and the levels of effectors, which, as discussed above, are approximated to be in the same concentration range as the RhoGTPases. Another approximation is that the concentration of endogenous Rac was considered constant upon transfection of GFP-Rac, Tiam1 and GDI, and reduced by half upon GDI knockdown. In the same manner that GDI knockdown may promote Rac degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Boulter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Bielek1">[40]</xref> the endogenous Rac levels might have also been perturbed by the different GFP constructs.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the sensitivity of the output functions to these approximations, we compute the effect of variations in the GDI concentration and the ratio between GEF and GAP using the optimized parametric set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Consistent with the experimental studies, the <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002831.e016">Eq. 16</xref>) has negligible dependence on GDI concentration while it is very sensitive to the GEF/GAP ratio (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In very low concentrations of GDI, approximately 5% of Rac will leave the membrane and become cytosolic. The effector concentration is able to increase the amount of active Rac in the absence of GDI (for GEF/GAP = 1, the fraction of active Rac is higher than 50%). However, at high GDI concentrations most of the Rac is cytosolic and inactive, even for very high GEF activity. Thus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Figure 4</xref> A–B makes explicit that knock down of GDI results in translocation of GTPase to the membrane, and increased net activity; the subsequent degradation of Rac would act as a compensatory mechanism.</p>
        <p>Importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Figure 4C–D</xref> reconciles the experiments for GDI knock-down ‘wt−GDI’ in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref> with more recent experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Boulter1">[7]</xref>. In the former, the same amount of active Rac is reported for ‘wt−GDI’ and ‘wt’ experiments. In contrast, the latter reference reports that depletion of GDI results in decreased GTPase expression and increased GTPase activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Figure 4C–D</xref> reports <italic>r0</italic> and fraction of active Rac as a function of GDI concentration for different levels of GTPase. The reference curve (open circles) corresponds to the concentration of Rac as in the experimental conditions ‘wt’. The solid vertical line marks the GDI concentration for the same experiment. Decreasing the expression level of Rac alone would decrease the fraction of Rac at the membrane and its activity level (curve with plus sign). The dashed vertical line marks the GDI concentration for the experiment ‘wt−GDI’. The solid squares show the points corresponding to GDI and Rac concentrations for ‘wt’ and ‘wt−GDI’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>. The fraction of active Rac is doubled (from 13% to 26%), while the concentration of Rac is decreased by half. In addition, the model predicts that Rac degradation prevented a further increase of up to 44%.</p>
        <p>We learn from this model that membrane cycling of Rac in NIH3T3 cells at steady state can be represented by a model where Rac dissociates from the membrane prior to its binding to GDI. The model topology is verified by the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. For a fixed GDI concentration, activation of a GEF results in the translocation of Rac from the cytosol to the membrane. The effect of the GEF is to reduce the dissociation of Rac from the membrane (reduce <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic>), resulting in a larger fraction of membrane bound Rac and a smaller fraction of cytosolic GDI bound Rac, consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Ugolev1">[18]</xref>. The knockdown of GDI results in translocation of GTPase to the membrane. The translocation alone promotes the activation of Rac, due to colocalization between the GEF and GTPase at the membrane. Furthermore, the degradation of Rac functions as a negative feedback, attenuating its hyperactivity.</p>

        <title>Example: Application to Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells</title>
        <p>In this section we illustrate how the parametric plots presented in Section Lumped model can be used to infer which modulatory events downstream of a signaling cascade are responsible for the experimental observations. We choose Rac cycling between cytosol and membranes (plasma and granular) in pancreatic β-cells during the second stage of insulin secretion upon glucose stimulus. This choice is based on its significance in diabetes and the ample availability of relevant experimental data regarding Rac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-McDonald1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Kowluru1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Ma1">[51]</xref>. Despite these many studies, thus far, it has not been possible to experimentally determine whether Rac translocation to the membrane is due to its decreased affinity for serine phosphorylated GDI (sGDI) alone, or whether a second signal promoting increased affinity between Rac and the plasma membrane is also necessary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Hughes1">[52]</xref>. We show that for a cell with the plasma and vesicular membranes, as in β-cells, the observed translocation of Rac can only be reproduced if the stimulus promotes both decreased affinity for GDI and increased affinity for the plasma membrane.</p>
        <p>Because Rac is localized both in plasma and vesicular membranes in β-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang3">[50]</xref>, the ratio of membrane surface to cytosolic volume is much larger than the ratio that pertained to our analysis of fibroblasts in Section Detailed model. The total surface area of vesicles is seven fold the plasma membrane area, while the maximum exocytosis rate for a membrane bound molecule is 2.4×10<sup>−4</sup>/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Barg1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Rorsman1">[49]</xref>. Note that the cycling rate of GTPase between plasma and vesicular membranes via the cytosol is two orders of magnitude faster than via vesicle fusion and scission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>. This leads to a model simplification: the vesicular traffic of GTPase does not need to be modeled, simply the total surface area of vesicles. Ideally, the same experimental procedures obtained for NIH3T3 should be repeated for β-cells. Unfortunately this data is not currently available. We use the kinetic data obtained in the Section Detailed model, the geometric data on the β-cells (surface area of plasma and vesicle membranes and intracellular volume), and the membrane fraction of Rac prior and 20 minutes after glucose stimulus to locate relevant regions of our contour plots.</p>
        <p>Although the overall system is still evolving at 20 min, the time scale of the glucose signaling cascade (several minutes) justifies a quasi-steady state approximation (the timescale for Rac cycling is seconds). The translocation of Rac in β-cells is attributed to two mechanisms: phosphorylation of GDI by Pak1, increasing <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref>, and activation of Phospholipase D1, decreasing <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Ma1">[51]</xref>. While the former mechanism was proved essential, the contribution of the latter has not been quantitated. However, it is known that inhibition of phosphatidic acid production obliterates the first stage of insulin secretion, which is upstream from the <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Hughes1">[52]</xref>. We next use the analysis of the contour plots to highlight the relevant properties of the system. More detailed description of Rac cycling in β-cells can be found in the supporting material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>First, we must identify the initial and final states of the system in the contour plots. If the distance between the two states can be represented by a horizontal line, the Rac translocation maybe due to phosphorylation of GDI alone. Prior to stimulus, the cytosolic concentrations of Rac, Cdc42 and GDI are 0.11, 0.15, and 0.39 µM, respectively, resulting in approximately 0.13 µM of free cytosolic GDI. From Section Detailed model, <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> = 1×10<sup>−3</sup> (white dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). At time 20 minutes after 20 mM of glucose exposure, there is 40% less Rac bound to GDI, the amount of active Rac in the plasma membrane increases by two fold, and so does the amount of Rac (active plus inactive) at all membranes (including plasma and vesicular) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Veluthakal1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Li1">[47]</xref>. The interaction between Cdc42 and GDI is unchanged at times 0 and 20 minutes (its redistribution is back to basal levels within five minutes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref>. There is no active Rac in the granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang3">[50]</xref>. We assume that Rac initially has the same binding rate per surface area for plasma and granular membrane (while the off rate depends on whether it is GDP or GTP bound as in Section Detailed model). In summary, prior to stimulus <italic>r0</italic> (plasma plus granular membranes) of Rac is 28%, reaching 57% at 20 minutes of glucose exposure (solid and dashed bold black curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The total surface area of the granules is approximately 3600 µm<sup>2</sup>, the surface area of the plasma membrane is 500 µm<sup>2</sup>, and the cytosolic volume (not including the volume of the 10000 granules) is 850 µm<sup>3</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Barg1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Rorsman1">[49]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Now that the contours for the initial and final states have been identified, it is necessary to identify either <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic> or <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> for each state. The former depends on GEF/GAP activity and effector concentrations. We choose to identify the latter. Two unknowns are critical: a) the fold decrease in affinity between Rac and sGDI versus Rac and GDI, and b) the initial amount of sGDI. We address the problem by covering a wide range of potential values for both unknowns.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5</xref> we contrast the analysis for the β-cell (surface to volume 4.8/µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), and a cell with surface to volume 0.524/µm, as pertains to fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> also corresponds to the case if Rac did not bind granules in β-cell (plasma membrane surface to volume ∼0.58/µm). The limiting values of <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic> with total membrane fraction of Rac being either GDP or GTP bound are represented by the horizontal white lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5A–C</xref>). While the lower line can be shifted to lower values of <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic> due to effector binding, the upper is a constraint of the system. Phosphorylated GDI (sGDI) has decreased affinity for Rac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-DerMardirossian3">[53]</xref>. Therefore we address the potential impact of an increase in dissociation constant of 5, 10 and 1000 (or 100 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) fold (solid black, dashed red, and bold green arrows respectively) for different initial conditions for the fraction of sGDI (different <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic>). We solve Eqs.(S21) and (S22) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref> for <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> at times 0 and 20 minutes, given the cytosolic concentrations of Rac, GDI and the 70% increase in sGDI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref>. Given <italic>r0<sub>f</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic>, the value of <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic> is extracted. Each arrow represents an effective solution from the states at time 0 to time 20 minutes: black arrowheads consider Cdc42.GDI to be inert (Eq.S21), while white arrowheads allows phosphorylation of GDI bound to Cdc42 (Eq.S22), with initial conditions for free GDI and GDI bound to Rac, 0.13 and 0.11 respectively. Note the gradual counterclockwise rotation of the arrows with increase of initial <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic>. Two values of cytosolic Cdc42 bound to GDI were considered: 0.15 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref> and 0.25 µM for comparison, which would result in increased total amount of GDI (dotted green arrow <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). (The effect of increased Cdc42 concentration for fixed GDI concentration, i.e., smaller free GDI concentration, is addressed in Fig. S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>). For small initial concentrations of sGDI, the solution is unperturbed by Cdc42 cytosolic concentration. However, at higher sGDI levels (starting from higher <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic>) the effect of the presence of another GDI binding partner with affinity undisturbed by this phosphorylation is noticeable: the arrow rotates counterclockwise. Still, for a cell with large <italic>Sfc/Vol</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) the rotation is not enough to turn the arrow horizontal, which would represent a shift in <italic>K<sub>DGDI</sub></italic> only. This means that phosphorylation of GDI by Pak1 is not the sole mechanism responsible for the translocation of Rac in β-cells. The identical fold increase in membrane bound and active Rac rules out the potential increase in GEF/GAP. Therefore, glucose stimulus is most likely to also promote an increase in affinity between Rac and the membrane (decrease <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic>), as shown in more detail in the dynamic examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> (and Fig. S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> the decrease in affinity due to sGDI is ten fold. For simplicity, the GDI bound to Cdc42 is disregarded. Three different types of primary responses were considered upon glucose stimulus (to start at 60 seconds): increase in GDI phosphorylation rate pG (cross), combined with the increase in Rac and plasma membrane association rate kon<sub>M</sub> (star), and increase in Rac and granular membrane association rate kon<sub>Gr</sub> (circles). These modulatory effects are represented by the coefficients <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> respectively (see definitions in Eqs.(S23)–(S26) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>). The dynamic model was run in Virtual Cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moraru1">[28]</xref>, and all parameters and rates can be found in the public model Falkenberg_GTPases_Rac_betaCell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vcell.org" xlink:type="simple">www.vcell.org</ext-link>). The membrane association rate is dependent on the amount of active PLD, represented by PLD*. In agreement with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> shows that in order to reproduce the experimental observations for fold increase in sGDI and membrane fraction of Rac (1.7 and 2 fold, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Wang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Veluthakal1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Li1">[47]</xref>), it is necessary that the affinity between Rac and membrane is also increased. Such increase must occur for both plasma and vesicle membranes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We developed a systematic methodology for modeling the cycling of the small GTPases between membrane and cytosol, and their interaction with GDI. We show how to derive the role of GDI from measurable experimental data. The parameters <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic> determine whether localized flux is sufficient to generate a sustained concentration gradient. The dependence of the apparent membrane dissociation rate <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> on GDI concentration reveals the importance of GDI mediated versus GDI independent GTPase membrane removal.</p>
      <p>The role of GDI in GTPase cycling can be analyzed using the loop described by the lumped model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Reversibility requires that the cycle has a null net flux at equilibrium (in which case <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic> = <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic>). Deviations from this detailed balance are expected in the live cell because it is an open thermodynamic system. However, the larger the net flux, the larger the energy loss. Therefore the contour plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2</xref> (and Fig. S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>) are expected to be a good reference for GTPase distribution as a function of the parameter <italic>ρ<sub>Eq</sub></italic> = <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic> = <italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic>. Charts similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2</xref> may be generated for situations when <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>≠<italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic> using Eqs.(S14) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002831.s001">Text S1</xref>, as long as six out of the eight rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> are known.</p>
      <p>An important conclusion of this study is that the role of GDI in the overall mechanism can change for different GTPases and its cellular or experimental context. For example, while interaction with rdi1 seems to be the fastest pathway to extract Cdc42 in yeast, in NIH3T3 cells the GDI acts as a buffer for Rac (<italic>ρ<sub>Eq</sub></italic> = 0). In addition, for Cdc42, it's been shown that the inactive GTPase has higher affinity for GDI than the active Cdc42 for membrane bound species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>. Activation of a GEF for Cdc42 would then increase <italic>K<sub>D1</sub></italic> and decrease <italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>. The expected outcome is the reduced removal rate of GTPase from the membrane and biased net flow towards the counter-clock direction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>.Note that the results for Cdc42 in yeast suggests that it cycles in a different regime than <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>. While the former has the interaction with rdi1 at the membrane as the preferred pathway for membrane removal of Cdc42, the latter reports identical membrane dissociation rates for GDI free or bound Cdc42.</p>
      <p>Rac membrane cycling occurs in a different manner. Based on experimental data from NIH3T3 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>, we show that the GDI independent mechanism is the dominant term for <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> and Rac cycles in the limit <italic>ρ<sub>Eq</sub></italic>∼0 of the lumped model. Consequently, the detailed model (including nucleotide state and effector binding) may be simplified by neglecting the dashed reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>. A parametric search for the remaining rates in the model suggests that the active Rac is removed from the membrane at a lower rate than the inactive Rac. This means that activation of a Rac GEF will increase Rac membrane fraction by decreasing <italic>K<sub>Dm</sub></italic>. Another consequence is the apparent higher affinity of cytosolic GDI towards membrane bound inactive rather than active Rac. This model is consistent with the more recent observations that decrease of available GDI results in translocation of GTPase to the membrane, and increase in its active fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Boulter1">[7]</xref>. In addition, we show that degradation of Rac would minimize both effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g004">Fig. 4C–D</xref>).</p>
      <p>The residues in GTPases and GDI susceptible to phosphorylation downstream of regulatory pathways have been recently reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-GarciaMata1">[54]</xref>. The long term effect of GDI and GTPases competing for its binding have also been addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Boulter1">[7]</xref>. Undoubtedly, these studies contribute immensely in understanding the qualitative impact of each of these factors on GTPase behavior. The charts of the lumped model allow visualization of the effect of these modifications on GTPase distribution.</p>
      <p>In contrast, only a handful of studies focus on the kinetics between GTPases, GDI and the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Moissoglu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Slaughter1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Johnson1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Nomanbhoy1">[42]</xref>. We show here that additional quantitative information can be extracted from measurable quantities. The analysis from Section GDI and <italic>k<sub>offAp</sub></italic> provided the basis for the topology of the model in Section Detailed model. It was essential to perform a model reduction to eliminate parameters/reactions with negligible impact on the observables prior to a parametric search. The presence of non-essential model components increases the number of unknowns and promotes the existence of multiple solutions with equivalent scores.</p>
      <p>In β-cells, particularly, due to the large surface area of membranes (including granules), phosphorylation of GDI alone is not sufficient to translocate Rac as observed experimentally. Based on the model of Rac membrane cycling developed in the Section Detailed model, and the parametric plots from the Section Example it is possible to infer that the signaling cascade must promote increased affinity between membranes and Rac. By contrast, phosphorylation of GDI in a system of smaller surface to volume ratio would have been sufficient for Rac translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). In other words, the geometry of the system provided a constraint that allows us to confirm the need for an additional feature in the signaling pathway of the β-cell in order to insure proper Rac redistribution.</p>
      <p>It is possible that the parameters extracted using NIH3T3 cells do not relate to β-cells, and it remains unknown if Rac cycling in other mammalian cells have similar behavior, due to lack of experimental data. The key point is that surface to volume ratio is a critical parameter for the analysis of GTPase cycling and would certainly need to be considered in comparing β-cells to fibroblasts. However, the Section Example makes it clear how investigators might benefit from experiments that would provide the parameters necessary to repeat the calculations from Sections Detailed model and Example, not only for Rac, but also for Cdc42 and RhoA. If the experimental datapoints fall in a different region of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, the reactions corresponding to the dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> must be considered, and <italic>ρ<sub>Eq</sub></italic> will no longer be null. Nevertheless, the parametric search can be performed using more experimental data points in order to determine all the parameters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>. An analysis similar to the one developed in the Section Example can be repeated using a different chart (or a series of charts) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, instead of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002831-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>.</p>
      <p>Another insight emerges from our analysis of the rates associated with the different mechanisms involved in GTPase. Because the kinetics for vesicle trafficking are two orders of magnitude slower than the other mechanisms, it is likely that the stimulated translocation of Rac from the plasma membrane to vesicles via Rab5 or hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Palamidessi1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002831-Huang1">[56]</xref> occurs via a mechanism that enhances the affinity between GTPases and the vesicular/endosome membranes. Note that this mechanism is different than removal/delivery of molecules due to scission/fusion of vesicles.</p>
      <p>In summary, we reported a systematic manner of studying GTPase membrane cycling. We identify the relevant terms in membrane cycling via analysis of different parametric groups. We provide the equilibrium solution for the membrane fraction of GTPase cycling in a reversible manner (and the equations for the irreversible scenario). We describe the circumstances in which GDI is inert in removing GTPase from the membrane (<italic>ρ<sub>Eq</sub></italic> = 0), or it either actively removes it (<italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic>) or delivers it to the membrane (<italic>ρ<sub>GDI</sub></italic>&lt;<italic>ρ<sub>m</sub></italic>). We show how to use the models to extract parameters from experimental data, and apply to the charts of the compact model. Finally, we used measurable quantities to infer which affinities are being regulated downstream of a signaling pathway. Generally, the methodology and models presented here can be applied to circumstances when concentration levels of GTPases or GDI are altered either through experimental manipulation or a disease state.</p>
