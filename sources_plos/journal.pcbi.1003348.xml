<abstract>
<p>It is well known that even under identical task conditions, there is a tremendous amount of trial-to-trial variability in both brain activity and behavioral output. Thus far the vast majority of event-related potential (ERP) studies investigating the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral performance have only tested a monotonic relationship between them. However, it was recently found that across-trial variability can correlate with behavioral performance independent of trial-averaged activity. This finding predicts a U- or inverted-U- shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output, depending on whether larger brain variability is associated with better or worse behavior, respectively. Using a visual stimulus detection task, we provide evidence from human electrocorticography (ECoG) for an inverted-U brain-behavior relationship: When the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity is closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times faster. Importantly, we show that this relationship is present not only in the post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity, but also in the pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. Our findings are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain. They further support attractor network theories, which postulate that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance, and proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The human brain is notoriously “noisy”. Even with identical physical sensory inputs and task demands, brain responses and behavioral output vary tremendously from trial to trial. Such brain and behavioral variability and the relationship between them have been the focus of intense neuroscience research for decades. Traditionally, it is thought that the relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance is monotonic: the highest or lowest brain activity levels are associated with the best behavioral performance. Using invasive recordings in neurosurgical patients, we demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between brain and behavioral variability. Under such a relationship, moderate brain activity is associated with the best performance, while both very low and very high brain activity levels are predictive of compromised performance. These results have significant implications for our understanding of brain functioning. They further support recent theoretical frameworks that view the brain as an active nonlinear dynamical system instead of a passive signal-processing device.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An inverted-U relationship is well established between brain function and many neuromodulatory influences, including arousal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Yerkes1">[1]</xref>, dopaminergic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Cools1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Vijayraghavan1">[3]</xref>, cholinergic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Bentley1">[4]</xref> and noradrenergic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-AstonJones1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Luksys1">[6]</xref> systems, with both insufficient and excessive levels of neuromodulation causing impaired brain function and performance. Interestingly, the possibility that a similar inverted-U function might exist between trial-to-trial fluctuations of brain activity and behavioral performance is seldom tested (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-LinkenkaerHansen1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-vanDijk1">[10]</xref>). The vast majority of studies on the relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavior have only investigated a monotonic relationship between them by, for example, comparing trial-averaged brain activity between different categories of behavioral performance (e.g., hits vs. misses) or computing the linear correlation between trial-to-trial brain activity and performance metrics [e.g., reaction times (RTs)]. These methods have been successfully applied to reveal influence on cognition/behavior by both pre-stimulus ongoing brain activity and post-stimulus brain responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Hesselmann1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Badre1">[15]</xref> and magnetoencephalography (MEG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Hoogenboom1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Hunt1">[17]</xref> signals from humans, as well as local field potentials (LFP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Womelsdorf1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Liebe1">[19]</xref> and neuronal spiking activity from primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-deLafuente1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Britten1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been increasingly appreciated that across-trial brain variability can be modulated independently from trial-averaged brain activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Churchland1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>. Moreover, behaviorally relevant information can be encoded within across-trial variability but not trial-averaged activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Steinmetz1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>. This phenomenon predicts the existence of a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. For example, if trials with fast and slow reaction times are associated with a similar level of trial-averaged activity but fast trials have smaller across-trial variability, as observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Steinmetz1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>, then brain activity closer to the across-trial mean should be more likely to be associated with fast RTs. Notably, several previous studies have shown that pre-stimulus amplitude of brain oscillations in sensory cortices has an inverted-U relationship with behavioral performance: Intermediate amplitudes predict higher hit rate and faster reaction times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-LinkenkaerHansen1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Zhang1">[9]</xref>. In light of the prevalent phase-amplitude coupling in the human brain whereby lower-frequency phase modulates higher-frequency power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Vanhatalo1">[32]</xref>, we conjectured that such an inverted-U relationship might also manifest in the raw fluctuations of field potentials, which is dominated by low-frequency activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the existence of both monotonic and inverted-U relationships between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance accord with the consideration that there are two sources of brain variability: deterministic and stochastic. The deterministic source of variability arises from spontaneous brain activity related to overall brain functioning that varies from trial to trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Fox2">[33]</xref>. Theoretical work further suggests that small differences in the initial state of a system can be deterministically amplified during responses to task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-vanVreeswijk1">[34]</xref>. The second source of variability is stochastic noise: Ion channel behavior is fundamentally indeterminate; ion channel noise contributes to synaptic noise, thence to membrane potential fluctuations and spike generation and propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Glimcher1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Traynelis1">[37]</xref>. As inescapable as stochastic noise is, randomness at the behavioral level confers an evolutionary advantage in a competitive ecological environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Glimcher1">[35]</xref>. As remarked by Alan Turing, “If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent” (1947, Lecture to London Mathematical Society).</p>
<p>Germane to the current thesis, the presence of stochastic noise predicts an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance: Under a large amount of noise, brain activity will be scattered across a wide range; under low noise, activity will remain close to the center “targeted” value. Even though the presence of stochastic noise is evolutionarily advantageous and beneficial in contexts such as stochastic resonance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-MendezBalbuena1">[38]</xref>, gambling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Glimcher1">[35]</xref>, and probabilistic decision making <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Deco1">[39]</xref>, under a specific task condition it could still degrade performance (e.g., musicians train for many years to attain motor consistency and precision) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Faisal1">[36]</xref>. Thus, the presence of stochastic noise in the brain should impose an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and performance. Using electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients undergoing invasive brain monitoring for neurosurgical treatment, we found strong evidence for such a phenomenon in the human brain.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Five patients undergoing invasive brain monitoring for treatment of epilepsy performed a visuomotor detection task (for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). They fixated on a white cross in the center of a black screen that occasionally changed to dark grey for 250 milliseconds at times unpredictable to the subject (inter-trial intervals (ITI) ranged from 2 to 19.04 sec, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), and were instructed to press a button as quickly as they detected the cue. Each subject completed 6∼8 blocks of visual detection task, alternating between the use of left and right index finger for button press. Overall, 149∼200 trials were obtained in each subject under contralateral or ipsilateral finger use (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003348-t001">Table 1</xref>). Their reaction times (RTs) did not depend on ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting a flat hazard rate, i.e., subjects were unable to predict the upcoming stimulus.</p>

Moreover, variability reduction can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity in both stimulus modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Churchland1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Chang1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref> and correlation with behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Steinmetz1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. To investigate whether variability reduction might also be observed in ECoG recordings, we first characterized the across-trial mean (similar to ERP) and variability time courses for each electrode.</p>
<p>We first analyzed the contralateral data (i.e., the index finger contralateral to the electrode grid was used for motor output). Across 153 electrodes in five subjects, 76 electrodes showed net negative deflections and 77 showed net positive deflections in the trial-averaged activity (assessed by the integral in a 0∼1500 ms post-stimulus window). A majority of the electrodes (N = 104) exhibited reduction of trial-to-trial variability in the post-stimulus period (assessed by the integral in a 0∼1500 ms post-stimulus window). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> shows the averaged ERP and trial-to-trial variability time courses for 24 Laplacian electrodes from a representative subject. Pooling across all 153 electrodes from five subjects, we observed a dramatic reduction of across-trial variability in the post-stimulus period that reached the minimum at 646 ms and gradually recovered to baseline at around 2 sec following the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, left column). In single electrodes, the reduction of variability was as much as 57.5%.</p>

<p>Strikingly, similar variability reduction was observed when the ipsilateral hand was used for motor output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, right column). Across 153 electrodes, the magnitude of variability reduction was slightly larger than when the contralateral hand was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This result is consistent with previous findings showing that the ipsilateral hemisphere can exhibit variability reduction even without a change in the trial-averaged activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Chang1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref> and that the magnitude of variability reduction in the ipsilateral cortex can exceed that in the contralateral cortex (see Fig. 6 in Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> Principal Component and Hit Rate</title>
<p>To test the Inverted-U hypothesis in relation to hit rate (using contralateral data), we first focused on a subject that had a sufficient number of miss trials to be analyzed individually (Patient #1, hit rate 55.7%, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003348-t001">Table 1</xref>). To reduce dimensionality, we applied PCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Briggman1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Fukushima1">[44]</xref> to data from all 36 electrodes, and extracted the first principal component (PC) accounting for the largest amount of variance. Trial-to-trial variability of this PC decreased in a sustained manner following stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, left), despite a non-significant averaged ERP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, left).</p>

<p>We computed the across-trial variability time courses for hit and miss trials separately, and found significantly smaller variability in hit than miss trials around and <italic>before</italic> the stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, right). By contrast, the averaged ERP was indistinguishable between hit and miss trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, right). Consistent with earlier findings, these data suggest that behaviorally relevant information can be encoded solely within the across-trial variability of brain activity but not the across-trial mean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Steinmetz1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>. Smaller variability in hit than miss trials, without a difference in the trial-averaged activity, is consistent with an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial ECoG activity and hit rate.</p>
<p>To directly test the inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity and hit rate, we binned all trials into quartiles according to the activity of the first PC at stimulus onset, and calculated the hit rate for each quartile separately. We found that the relationship between hit rate and ECoG activity indeed followed an inverted-U function, such that both very low and very high ECoG activity at stimulus onset foreshadowed more misses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, left). When the ECoG activity was close to the across-trial mean, hit rate was as much as 67.6%; whereas when it was most negative or most positive, hit rate dropped to 51.4% and 43.2%, respectively. An inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial ECoG activity and hit rate should also manifest as a negative monotonic relationship between the rectified amplitude of ECoG activity and hit rate, as activity closer to the mean is associated with smaller amplitude (note that this relationship applies to broadband signals but not narrow-band oscillations; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003348.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We thus extracted the instantaneous ECoG signal amplitude at stimulus onset via Hilbert transform (throughout the article, “amplitude” refers to rectified amplitude). By binning all trials into four groups according to amplitude, we indeed uncovered a negative monotonic dependence between hit rate and amplitude: Hit rate was 70.3% in the lowest amplitude bin, and it dropped to 40.5% in the highest amplitude bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, middle). Comparing hit with miss trials directly, we found that ECoG signal amplitude at stimulus onset was significantly smaller in hit than miss trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, right; P = 0.007, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</p>
<p>Across the remaining four subjects, there was a similar inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity (the first PC extracted from each subject's data) at stimulus onset and hit rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, quartile binning within each subject). Combining data across all five subjects, the amplitude of the first PC at stimulus onset was significantly smaller in hit compared to miss trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>; P = 0.008, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). These results suggest that the first PC extracted from the ECoG data shows an inverted-U relationship with hit rate, such that both very low and very high activity levels at stimulus onset predict more misses.</p>
<p>Lastly, we examined whether the inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity and hit rate might also exist when the ipsilateral hand was used for motor output. Again, PCA was applied to each subject's data to extract the first PC. Across five subjects, the amplitude of the first PC did not significantly differentiate between hit and miss trials, although there was a trend effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>, P = 0.062, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</p>

<title>Analysis Combining across PCs</title>
<p>In order to generalize the above findings beyond the first PC, we applied PCA to each subject's data, sorted the PCs by the amount of variance they explained in descending order, and extracted the first 5 PCs in each subject. We sought to test whether the population activity reflected across multiple PCs might also exhibit an inverted-U relationship with behavior; we further assessed the dependence of such a relationship on the number of PCs included. To this end, we first computed the across-trial mean time course for each PC. We then obtained the distance (i.e., absolute difference) between its activity in each trial and its across-trial mean, and averaged this distance across the chosen number of PCs to obtain a “summary” distance time course for each trial – <italic>D(t)</italic> (for details see <bold>Distance-to-Mean Analysis</bold> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The Inverted-U hypothesis suggests that in a given trial, the farther the population activity is from the across-trial mean (i.e., the larger the <italic>D(t)</italic>), the worse the behavioral performance.</p>
<p>We first investigated the contralateral data. The top one, three or five PCs from each subject were included in the analysis, which accounted for 15.1±7.0% (mean±s.d. across subjects), 35.2±5.7% and 50.1±7.0% of total variance respectively. Pooling data across all subjects, <italic>D(t)</italic> was smaller in hit trials than miss trials around stimulus onset (t = 0 ms), regardless of the number of PCs included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Hence, at stimulus onset, activity closer to the across-trial mean predicted a higher hit rate. Interestingly, increasing the number of PCs included in the analysis from 1 to 5 progressively decreased the strength of this relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), implying that the inverted-U relationship with hit rate was likely localized to a subset of the electrodes, a topic that we shall return to later.</p>

<p>Next, we computed the correlation between <italic>D(t)</italic> at each time point and RT across all hit trials from all subjects. This analysis revealed a positive correlation between RT and <italic>D(t)</italic> around the time of behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that in a given trial, the closer the ECoG activity is to the across-trial mean, the faster the reaction time. Contrary to the hit-vs.-miss analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), this effect was slightly stronger when more PCs were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating that the inverted-U relationship with RT was relatively distributed across electrodes. To ensure that the correlation between <italic>D(t)</italic> and RT was driven by trial-to-trial variability but not inter-subject differences, we plotted <italic>D(t)</italic> against RT across all trials from all subjects, and confirmed that the distributions for different subjects were largely overlapping (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003348.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Electrode-by-Electrode Analysis</title>
<p>The above results demonstrate the existence of an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance at the principal-component level. An important remaining question regards the spatial localizations of the inverted-U relationship vis-à-vis the classical monotonic brain-behavior relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-vanDijk1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Womelsdorf1">[18]</xref>). To address this question, we performed an electrode-by-electrode analysis on the contralateral data. Given the above results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), for hit-vs.-miss analysis we focused on ECoG activity at stimulus onset; for RT analysis we focused on ECoG activity around the behavioral responses.</p>
<p>To identify a monotonic relationship between ECoG activity and hit rate, we directly compared the ECoG signal value at stimulus onset between hit and miss trials. To identify a U- or inverted-U- (i.e., quadratic) relationship between ECoG activity and hit rate, we compared the amplitude of the ECoG signal at stimulus onset between hit and miss trials (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Larger amplitude in miss than hit trials indicates an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial ECoG activity and hit rate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Across 153 electrodes in five subjects, 10 electrodes showed a significant monotonic relationship, which was not significant at the population level (population-level P = 0.09, binomial statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>), with exactly half of them having higher activity in hit than miss trials. Twenty electrodes showed a significant quadratic relationship to hit rate (population-level P = 5.8e-5, binomial statistics), with 75% of them having larger amplitude in miss than hit trials (i.e., an inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity and hit rate). Three electrodes demonstrated both a significant monotonic and a significant quadratic relationship with hit rate. The spatial localizations of electrodes showing monotonic vs. quadratic relationships and their overlaps are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>.</p>

<p>To assess the relationship between ECoG activity and RT, for each electrode we averaged the ECoG activity within a 340∼510 ms post-stimulus window, as the median RT ranged from 340 to 510 ms across subjects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003348-t001">Table 1</xref>). We then characterized both linear and quadratic relationships between the ECoG activity and RT across trials. In total, 21 electrodes showed a linear correlation between ECoG activity and RT (<italic>R</italic>T<italic> = βx+c</italic>, where <italic>x</italic> is the ECoG signal value; population-level P = 1.9e-5, binomial statistics), with 57% of them being a positive correlation. Twenty-one electrodes showed a significant quadratic relationship (<italic>R</italic>T<italic> = αx<sup>2</sup>+βx+c</italic>; population-level P = 1.9e-5, binomial statistics). The coefficient of the quadratic term (<italic>α</italic>) is positive in 20 out of 21 (i.e., 95.2%) electrodes , suggesting that both very low and very high ECoG activity levels were associated with slower RTs (i.e., an inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity and response speed). The spatial localizations of electrodes exhibiting linear vs. quadratic relationship with RT and their overlaps (N = 8) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>.</p>
<p>Overall, electrodes demonstrating monotonic and quadratic brain-behavior relationships tended to form separate but adjacent clusters with limited overlap between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Detailed characterizations of an example electrode showing a quadratic relationship with RT are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g007">Fig. 7</xref>. Its across-trial variability time course showed sustained reduction following stimulus onset, despite a transient change in the averaged ERP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). We separated all hit trials in this subject (N = 195) into two groups via a median-split on RT, and found significantly smaller trial-to-trial variability in this electrode for fast compared with slow trials at around 400∼500 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). The difference in variability between fast and slow trials was most pronounced at 447 ms following stimulus onset (P = 1.1e-7, two-sample F-test). A scatter plot of the ECoG activity at 447 ms against RT across all hit trials is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, which can be described by a U-shaped function (P = 0.0001). Importantly, at slower RTs, the distribution of the ECoG activity is wider, encompassing low, medium and high values; by contrast, faster RTs are accompanied by a narrow distribution of ECoG activity around medium values. This is consistent with the idea that a higher level of stochastic noise, which scatters the ECoG activity across a wider range, accompanies slower reaction times.</p>

<title>Analysis Combining across Electrodes</title>
<p>So far we have demonstrated an inverted-U relationship between task performance and ECoG activity at the principal-component and single-electrode levels. These results suggest that in a given trial, the closer the ECoG activity is to the across-trial mean, the better the behavioral performance. Lastly, we sought to test the Inverted-U hypothesis by combining information across all electrodes. Because task processing requires coordinated actions from distributed areas of the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Bressler1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-GonzalezCastillo1">[47]</xref>, we reasoned that if the system as a whole is farther away from its targeted trajectory (approximated here roughly by the across-trial mean activity), behavioral performance should be compromised.</p>
<p>To this end, we computed the distance-to-mean measure <italic>D<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic> for each electrode instead of each PC, using the contralateral data. Then, for both analyses on hit rate and RT, we obtained a “summary” distance time course <italic>D(t)</italic> for each trial by averaging <italic>D<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic> across three electrode groups separately: i) all electrodes showing a significant quadratic relationship with hit rate or RT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6 A or B</xref>); ii) all other non-significant electrodes; and iii) all electrodes.

<p>From the analysis on RT, we found that combining information across all significant electrodes yielded a significant correlation between RT and <italic>D(t)</italic> mostly around behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>, red).

The <italic>D(t)</italic>-RT correlation was present as early as 500 ms before the stimulus onset when information from all electrodes were combined.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, consistent with earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-LinkenkaerHansen1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Zhang1">[9]</xref>, the present results provide strong evidence for an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance in the human brain, such that moderate activity predicts better behavioral performance (more hits and shorter RTs), whereas both very low and very high activity levels are associated with degraded performance (more misses and longer RTs). While these previous studies have focused on the amplitude of alpha and mu oscillations in sensory cortices, the present study extends the inverted-U relationship to the raw fluctuations of field potentials (similar to single-trial ERPs) outside the sensory cortex. Specifically, when the contralateral hand was used for motor output, we found that the inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial ECoG activity and hit rate was most pronounced around the stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and was relatively localized to a subset of electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g008">Fig. 8</xref> A–C). By contrast, the inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity and response speed was strongest around behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) and was more distributed across all electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). Interestingly, when the ipsilateral hand was used for motor output instead, the inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity and hit rate was most pronounced around behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), and that between ECoG activity and response speed was less robust and more sporadic in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>The Laplacian montage of ECoG approximates transcortical recording, such that increased cortical excitability manifests as more negative ECoG signals. Thus, the inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial ECoG activity and behavioral performance suggests that both very low and very high cortical activity, manifesting as most positive and most negative ECoG signals respectively, are associated with compromised performance, while intermediate activity levels are associated with better performance. These findings support the notion that a higher level of stochastic noise, which scatters the brain activity across a wider range, is associated with degraded performance under a specific task condition. Importantly, such an effect is not contradictory to a potentially beneficial role of stochastic noise during development or evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Glimcher1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-McIntosh1">[48]</xref>. For example, young adulthood is associated with larger brain variability as compared with both childhood and aging, and at the same time more accurate and consistent behavioral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Garrett1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Garrett2">[51]</xref>. We think that these observations are complementary instead of contradictory to the present results, as both a wider dynamic range at rest and the ability to quickly settle into the desired state during task should be associated with better function. Thus, across developmental stages, larger brain variability is an index of a wider dynamic range and a greater repertoire of potential brain states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-McIntosh1">[48]</xref>. On the other hand, during task processing, the ability of the brain to quickly settle into a particular task state is highly desirable and predictive of better performance. Indeed, post-stimulus brain responses appear to be more variable in patients with autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Dinstein1">[27]</xref> and schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Winterer1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>An inverted-U brain-behavior relationship is consistent with the present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Figs. 3B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g007">7B</xref>) and earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Steinmetz1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref> findings showing that better behavioral performance can be accompanied by smaller trial-to-trial variability, even without any correlation with trial-averaged activity. An inverted-U relationship has also been reported between trial-to-trial neuronal firing rate and movement speed in the macaque premotor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Churchland2">[29]</xref>. In addition to the different recording modalities and species, the present results extend this previous finding in several directions by showing: i) the inverted-U relationship is present in both post-stimulus brain responses and pre-stimulus ongoing activity up to 500 ms before the stimulus onset; ii) the inverted-U relationship had largely separate spatial localizations from the monotonic brain-behavior relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6</xref>); and iii) the spatiotemporal patterns of the inverted-U relationship differ between performance metrics (hit rate vs. RT) and motor output (contralateral vs. ipsilateral) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g005">5</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g008">8</xref>), suggesting functional specificity.</p>
<p>The difference in spatial localization for the inverted-U vs. monotonic brain-behavior relationships is consistent with our earlier observation that variability-based analysis results follow a different spatial distribution from mean-based analysis results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>. It is worth noting that the exact spatial localizations of the quadratic and monotonic brain-behavior relationships in our electrode-by-electrode analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) should not be over-interpreted. This is partly because the spatial localizations revealed by ECoG in neurosurgical patients are subject to limited electrode coverage (especially under Laplacian montage) as well as heterogeneous spatial sampling from subject to subject (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). More importantly, as revealed in our analysis on RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>), there is a significant amount of behaviorally relevant information distributed among non-significant electrodes. Our PCA analysis also suggests that the inverted-U relationship with RT is distributed amongst the top PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results are consistent with a recent fMRI study showing that with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, over 95% of the brain is involved in a simple visual attention task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-GonzalezCastillo1">[47]</xref>. Lastly, a limitation of the present study is that the primary (visual) sensory regions were not sampled by the ECoG electrodes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), hindering a direct comparison with earlier studies on this topic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-LinkenkaerHansen1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Zhang1">[9]</xref>. Nonetheless, our results in somatosensory/motor regions are consistent with earlier neurophysiological studies in the macaque <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Churchland1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Churchland2">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The traditional framework in neuroscience surmises that brain responses during task are the superposition of noise-like ongoing activity and task-evoked activity. This framework predicts variability increase after task onset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref> and a monotonic relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. Our findings of stimulus-induced variability reduction and an inverted-U brain-behavior relationship cannot be accommodated within this traditional framework. Instead, our results are readily embraced by attractor-network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Wong1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Deco2">[55]</xref> and liquid-state machine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Buonomano1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Bick1">[58]</xref> theories. These theories predict that as the network settles into a particular state or trajectory during task processing, across-trial variability decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Deco2">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Mazor1">[59]</xref>. The faster the system converges onto this state, the more similar its activity will be across trials, predicting a correlation between fast RT and smaller across-trial variability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> herein and Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Steinmetz1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He1">[30]</xref>). Moreover, because the presence of stochastic noise scatters brain activity across a wider range than the targeted state, the closer the brain activity is to the targeted trajectory, the better the behavioral performance, consistent with the inverted-U relationship we observed. Notably, these ideas have close parallels to the “optimal-subspace hypothesis” developed in the context of motor preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Shenoy1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>While the attractor-network framework provides potential explanations for our observation of an inverted-U relationship between post-stimulus brain activity and performance, what could account for the presence of such a relationship at or before the stimulus onset? One potential explanation for our results might be provided by the sampling-based Bayesian framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Fiser1">[61]</xref>. This idea proposes that the brain activity trajectory through the multidimensional state space samples different potential states; the distribution of the pre-stimulus samples constitutes the prior of its internal model, and that of the post-stimulus samples constitutes the posterior of the model. Accordingly, pre-stimulus activity closer to the across-trial mean would represent cortical states that are <italic>a priori</italic> more probable (assuming a unimodal distribution). Speculatively, this “most probable” state might also be the most “ready” state, and thus be associated with better performance. Another, not mutually exclusive, explanation lies in the framework of stochastic resonance – a nonlinear effect whereby an optimal level of noise facilitates the detection of a weak stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Wiesenfeld1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Collins1">[63]</xref>. This framework has been invoked previously to explain the inverted-U relationship between pre-stimulus amplitude of brain oscillations and task performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-LinkenkaerHansen1">[7]</xref>. Since low-frequency activity phase modulates higher-frequency power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Vanhatalo1">[32]</xref>, such a mechanism might explain our results pertaining to the raw fluctuations of broadband signals as well. In addition, a theoretical model utilizing input-output nonlinearity to explain an inverted-U relationship between pre-stimulus oscillatory power and ERP has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Rajagovindan1">[8]</xref>. Needless to say, the exact mechanisms of the inverted-U brain-behavior relationship we uncovered in the pre-stimulus period await future investigations. In particular, elucidation of the interaction between higher-frequency brain oscillations and lower-frequency raw signal fluctuations (such as the slow-cortical potentials) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Vanhatalo1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Nikulin1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Mazaheri1">[65]</xref> in the context of inverted-U brain-behavior relationship might provide clues to the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results are in line with recent theoretical frameworks suggesting that the brain is an active nonlinear dynamical system whose activity trajectory embodies information processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-McIntosh1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Buonomano1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Rabinovich1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Llinas1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Bressler2">[69]</xref>. Interestingly, the inverted-U and monotonic relationships between brain activity and behavioral performance were largely segregated in their spatial localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). While the presence of stochastic noise in the brain could impose an inverted-U relationship between brain activity and behavioral performance, it is tempting to speculate that the monotonic relationship might have a larger contribution from the deterministic source of brain variability. The underlying mechanisms of these two dissociable types of brain-behavior relationships should be an important topic for future experimental and theoretical studies.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Five patients undergoing surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy participated in the study. All patients had complex partial seizures. To localize epileptogenic zones, patients underwent a craniotomy for subdural placement of electrode grids and strips followed by 1–2 weeks of continuous video and ECoG monitoring. The placement of the electrodes and the duration of monitoring were determined solely by clinical considerations. Exclusion criteria were: (1) widespread interictal spike-and-wave discharges; (2) age &lt;15 years old; (3) severely impaired cognitive capability; (4) diffuse brain tissue abnormality, e.g., tuberous sclerosis, cerebral palsy; (5) limited electrode coverage. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003348-t001">Table 1</xref> for demographic, clinical and data collection information.

<title>ECoG Data Acquisition</title>
<p>The electrode arrays (typically 8×8, 6×8 or 2×5) and strips (typically 1×6 or 1×8) consisted of platinum electrodes of 4-mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed) with a center-to-center distance of 10 mm between adjacent electrodes (AD-TECH Medical Instrument Corporation, Racine WI). ECoG signals were split and sent to both the clinical EEG system and a research EEG system (SynAmp<sup>2</sup> RT, Neuroscan, DC-coupled recording). All data in the present study were from the research amplifier. Sampling frequency was 1000 Hz.

<p>Subjects fixated on a white cross in the center of a black screen; the cross occasionally changed to dark grey for 250 ms at times unpredictable to the subject. Inter-trial intervals (ITIs) ranged from 2 to 19.04 sec, randomly drawn from an Exponential distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Subjects were instructed to press a button as quickly as they detected the cue. Their force and reaction times (RTs) were recorded. Each task block contained 50 trials, lasting about 5 min. Subjects alternated between the use of left and right index fingers in different blocks. Each subject completed 6∼8 blocks in total. Task blocks using the finger contralateral and ipsilateral to the electrode grid (coverage was confined to one hemisphere in each patient) were analyzed separately. Unless otherwise noted, the reported results were computed using the contralateral blocks.

Anatomical images were acquired using a sagittal T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence (TR = 2200 ms, TE = 2.34 ms, flip angle = 7°, inversion time = 1000 ms, 1×1×1 mm<sup>3</sup> voxels).

<title>ECoG Data Preprocessing</title>
<p>In order to focus on brain activity directly underneath each electrode, we re-referenced the ECoG data to a Laplacian montage (similar as in Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He3">[40]</xref>). Under the Laplacian montage, the signal for each electrode is derived from the difference between this electrode and four surrounding electrodes that are nearest neighbors (1 cm apart from the center electrode). This necessitates the presence of four surrounding electrodes, so only electrodes on the grids (less the border rows) without an excluded electrode in the vicinity can be used as the center electrodes. The number of electrodes contributing to the Laplacian montage derivation (including center and reference electrodes) in each subject ranged from 48 to 64, and the final number of Laplacian electrodes ranged from 24 to 36 in each subject (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003348-t001">Table 1</xref>). Lastly, ECoG signals were filtered in 0.05∼50 Hz range with a 3<sup>rd</sup>-order acausal Butterworth filter offline, before any further analyses. The choice of the low-pass filter at 50 Hz was to avoid power line noise at 60 Hz. High-pass filter at 0.05 Hz was chosen in order to remove slow artifacts including electrode drift, but to retain as much of physiological signals in the low-frequency range as possible. It was an empirically determined value based on our recording set-up.</p>

<title>Event-Related Potential (ERP) Analysis</title>
<p>In all analyses, time 0 indicates stimulus onset (the onset of crosshair dim). ERPs were obtained by averaging across trials in an epoch of −500∼2000 ms. No baseline correction was conducted in order to allow unbiased analyses of pre-stimulus activity in relation to behavioral performance. The significance of the ERP at single-electrode level was assessed by a paired t-test of post-stimulus activity at every time point against the pre-stimulus activity (averaged in a −500∼0 ms window) across trials. Difference of the ERP between hit and miss trials was assessed by a two-sample t-test at every time point.</p>

<title>Across-Trial Variability Analysis</title>
<p>Across-trial variability time courses were computed for each electrode as the standard deviation (s.d.) of ECoG signal across trials at each time point from 500 ms before to 2 sec after the stimulus onset. The time courses were normalized to the pre-stimulus mean (averaged in a −500∼0 ms time window) and expressed in %change unit.</p>
<p>To assess significant post-stimulus increase or decrease of across-trial variability for a single electrode or principal component (PC), we used a two-sample F-test for variance. To increase robustness, the pre-stimulus activity was averaged within a window of −100∼0 ms, and the post-stimulus activity was averaged within a 100-ms-long window centered at the time point of interest. The F-test was conducted for pre-stimulus vs. post-stimulus activity across all trials, and was carried out for each post-stimulus time point from 50 to 1950 ms.</p>
<p>For hit vs. miss or fast vs. slow variability analyses, across-trial variability time courses were computed for each subgroup of trials (hit, miss, fast, slow). Difference in variability between two groups of trials was assessed by a two-sample F-test for variance. To increase robustness, the ECoG signal in each trial was averaged within a 100-ms-long window centered on the time point of interest.

<title>Relationship between ECoG Activity and Hit Rate (PC-Level Analysis)</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between trial-to-trial pre-stimulus ECoG activity and hit rate, we sorted all trials from each subject into four quartiles according to the pre-stimulus ECoG activity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003348-t001">Table 1</xref> for the total number of trials in each subject), and calculated the hit rate for each quartile separately. Approximately 37∼50 trials were present in each bin. Two metrics for defining the pre-stimulus activity were used: 1) the averaged ECoG activity in a pre-stimulus window of −200∼0 ms; and 2) the instantaneous ECoG activity value at stimulus onset. The two metrics gave similar results, thus we only report results using the instantaneous activity value here.</p>
<p>In addition, Hilbert transform was applied to ECoG activity in each trial to obtain the instantaneous amplitude signal. The amplitude at stimulus onset was analyzed in relation to hit rate. Two analyses were carried out: (i) All trials in each subject were sorted into quartiles according to the ECoG signal amplitude at stimulus onset, and then hit rate was computed for each quartile; (ii) The amplitude was directly compared between hit and miss trials via a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>

Then for each trial, we averaged the distance (i.e., absolute difference) to the mean across electrodes/PCs:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003348.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003348.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Thus, we obtained a <italic>D(t)</italic> time course for each trial in each subject. Next, we compared <italic>D(t)</italic> between hit and miss trials (combining data across all subjects) using a two-sample t-test at each time point <italic>t</italic>. A smaller <italic>D(t)</italic> in hit than miss trials suggests that activity closer to the mean is associated with a higher hit rate. For each time point <italic>t</italic>, we also calculated the linear correlation between <italic>D(t)</italic> and RT across all hit trials, again combining data across all subjects. A significant positive correlation indicates that the farther away the system is from the across-trial mean, the larger the RT (i.e., an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial ECoG activity and response speed).</p>

<title>Electrode-Level Analysis</title>
<p>For each electrode, we investigated the dependence of hit rate on trial-to-trial ECoG activity at stimulus onset. A monotonic relationship was tested by a two-sample t-test on the ECoG activity value at stimulus onset between hit and miss trials. A quadratic relationship was tested by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test of the ECoG signal amplitude at stimulus onset between hit and miss trials. A smaller amplitude in hit as compared to miss trials means that hit rate was higher when ECoG activity was closer to the mean.</p>
<p>To evaluate the dependence of RT on trial-to-trial ECoG activity, we first averaged the ECoG activity in a post-stimulus 340∼510 ms time window (because the median RT in each subject ranged from 340 to 510 ms). Both linear (<italic>R</italic>T<italic> = βx+c</italic>) and quadratic (<italic>R</italic>T = <italic>αx<sup>2</sup>+βx+c</italic>) relationships were assessed between ECoG activity (<italic>x</italic> in the above equations) and RT across all hit trials, using <monospace>corr</monospace> and <monospace>regstats</monospace> functions in Matlab respectively. For a significant quadratic relationship, if the coefficient <italic>α</italic> is positive, that means RT is shorter when ECoG activity was closer to the across-trial mean (i.e., an inverted-U relationship between ECoG activity and response speed).</p>

<title>Correction for Multiple Comparisons in the Time Domain</title>
<p>Several of our analyses relied on statistical tests on every time sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Figs. 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g007">7A–B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g008">8</xref>). Thus, it is important to control for false positive rate due to the multiple comparisons carried out. Because adjacent time points in broadband ECoG activity are highly correlated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He2">[31]</xref>, statistical tests on different time points are not independent. To account for temporal autocorrelation in the ECoG signal and derive the true degree of freedom in a 2.5-sec epoch, we employed Bartlett's theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Jenkins1">[71]</xref>. The Bartlett correction factor (BCF) was calculated for every electrode as the integral of the squared lagged-autocorrelation function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-Vincent1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-VanDijk1">[73]</xref>. The median of BCF across 153 electrodes for contralateral and ipsilateral data was 307.4 and 266.3, respectively. Since the task epoch contained 2501 time points, the upper limit for the number of independent tests was 2501/266.3 = 9.4. Hence, under Bonferroni correction, a P-value of 0.005 for the uncorrected test would fall in the range of P&lt;0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. We therefore thresholded all our results at a significance level of P&lt;0.005 (uncorrected).</p>

The red trace is the amplitude time series extracted by Hilbert transform. Notice that the time points in the raw signal that are close to 0 are associated with a smaller amplitude. Thus, amplitude extracted from the broadband data can supplement our time-domain analyses by converting an inverted-U relationship for raw ECoG activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, left) to a negative monotonic relationship for amplitude (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, middle), which is more amenable to statistical testing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003348-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, right). <bold>Bottom</bold>: Amplitude time series (red) extracted by Hilbert transform applied to the raw filtered time series in the 7∼13 Hz range (blue).

This choice of β is close to the power-law exponent of low-frequency ECoG activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003348-He2">[31]</xref>. Simulated fBm was filtered in the range 0.05∼50 Hz (top) and 9∼11 Hz (bottom) and the instantaneous amplitude was extracted via Hilbert transform. A narrower bandpass filter was used for the simulated fBm (9∼11 Hz) than for the ECoG data (7∼13 Hz) because the ECoG signal contained an alpha oscillation at ∼10 Hz, which was not present in the simulated fBm.</p>
