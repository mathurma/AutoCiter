        <p>This is an “Editors' Outlook” article for <italic>PLoS Computational Biology</italic>.</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Epidemiology, literally the “study of what is upon people”, is concerned with the dynamics of health and disease in human populations. Research in epidemiology aims to identify the distribution, incidence, and etiology of human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Green1">[1]</xref> to improve the understanding of the causes of diseases and to prevent their spread. Traditionally, epidemiology has been based on data collected by public health agencies through health personnel in hospitals, doctors' offices, and out in the field. In recent years, however, novel data sources have emerged where data are frequently collected directly from individuals through the digital traces they leave as a consequence of modern communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Eysenbach1">[2]</xref> and an increased use of electronic devices.</p>
      <p>The communication revolution—the explosion of mobile phone and Internet usage—unfolding in the past few decades has led to two major outcomes: that all types of modern communication are now digital, and that the number of users of devices enabling digital communication is in the billions, rapidly approaching full coverage in large parts of the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-International1">[3]</xref>. As a consequence, an increasingly large fraction of what we do and say—including epidemiologically relevant behaviors such as deciding on preventive measures and treatment choices, as well as reporting disease symptoms—is stored electronically, often in accessible form and thus amenable to analysis. Extracting meaningful information from this data deluge is challenging, but holds unparalleled potential for epidemiology. The observation of the spatiotemporal movements of millions of people during disease outbreaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Bengtsson1">[4]</xref>, the rapid detection of an unusual respiratory illness in a remote village anywhere on the globe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Brownstein1">[5]</xref>, the near real-time estimation of influenza activity levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Ginsberg1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Signorini1">[7]</xref>, and the assessment of vaccination sentiments during pandemic preparedness efforts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Salath1">[8]</xref> are examples of realizations of this potential.</p>
      <p>Web-based data mining is having a revolutionary impact on the way we monitor global health outcomes and behaviors. Some types of infectious and chronic disease data can be captured from and disseminated in near real-time through an array of online sources including chat rooms, social networks, blogs, web search records, and online news media. These online sources provide a picture of global health that is often different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Brownstein2">[9]</xref> from the picture created by traditional surveillance systems. In fact, these data streams have become invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders, fill in gaps in public health infrastructure, and complement existing traditional surveillance systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Heymann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Heymann2">[11]</xref>. While for many of the most vulnerable countries, lab and clinical surveillance capacity are still years from being realized, health information is already being exchanged via web queries, social networking sites, and mobile devices.</p>
      <p>These data sources, when harnessed appropriately, can provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world. Further, these sources have been credited with decreasing the time between an outbreak and formal recognition of an outbreak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Chan1">[12]</xref>, thus allowing for an expedited response to the public health threat. Data from search engines can now provide early warning of respiratory illnesses in local communities while data from social networking sites can provide early warning of vaccine refusal stemming from conspiracy theories or other reasons. Online news media can provide a window into the emergence of pandemics weeks before it is brought to light by traditional surveillance. Similarly, data from social media could tell us about emerging trends in a wide range of health behaviors—e.g., the uptake of new tobacco products—at the local and national level.</p>
      <p>Traditional surveillance methods emerged in a world that was very different from an epidemiological perspective. Prior to the introduction of vaccines, most deaths were caused by infectious diseases (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Grove1">[13]</xref> for the vital statistics rates in the United States). In the past, networks on which diseases spread were much more limited geographically in their expansion, due to limited social and spatial mobility. This was also manifested by slower geographic dissemination of diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Noble1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Hufnagel1">[15]</xref>. Nowadays, non-communicable diseases are by far the main cause of illness and death in high-income countries, while accounting for about half of the burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-World1">[16]</xref>. Depression, type-II diabetes, and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases pose a substantial public health risk and are typically associated with behavioral risk factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Mokdad1">[17]</xref>. These risk factors—such as drug abuse, smoking, and poor diet and exercise—and the associated diseases are often found to be clustered in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Schuit1">[18]</xref>. The processes by which this empirical pattern arises are currently not fully understood, but as more individual health behaviors and outcomes are shared online, digital epidemiology offers an increasingly clear picture of the dynamics of these processes. With respect to infectious diseases, newly emerging pathogens can appear unexpectedly, spread very rapidly, and be potentially devastating to millions. A consequence of this change in the epidemiologic landscape is that individual behaviors are now at the center of disease dynamics and control. Individual behaviors will play a key role in social distancing efforts as early responses to newly emerging, rapidly spreading infectious diseases. One of the key advantages of online social media data, apart from the increasingly large data volumes, is that they are highly contextual and networked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Salath1">[8]</xref>, and increasingly hyperlocal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002616-g001">Figure 1</xref>). For example, the networked nature of the Twitter data in the vaccination sentiment study by Salathé and Khandelwal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Salath1">[8]</xref> allowed for the identification of network clusters with strong sentiment bias, and of positive dyadic assortativity of vaccination sentiments across the entire network of users. Overall, these advantages allow us to study individuals and groups in the rich contexts in which their lives unfold, and to study person-to-person spread of disease and behaviors at the level at which it actually occurs.</p>

      <p>Thus, there is great potential to deepen understanding of disease dynamics through the analysis of digital traces. To date, however, most epidemiologic studies involving such data have focused on presumed routes of transmission that have not yet been empirically established. For instance, we are still in need of data that indicate the relative importance of droplet, airborne, and contact transmission of influenza and other common respiratory infections in natural community settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Goldfrank1">[19]</xref>. Until researchers employ rigorous and sensitive study designs for identifying modes of transmission with confidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Brewer1">[20]</xref>, the empirical basis of prevention advice for many infectious diseases will remain weak. Fortunately, diverse types of digital trace data may enhance exposure measurement and facilitate strong tests of specific routes of transmission. For example, in studies of small communities, such as schools or workplaces, individuals could carry or wear digital devices that sense their face-to-face proximity to others as well as record their spatial movements. Proximity and spatial mobility data, when coupled with regular surveillance of symptoms and incident infections and viral sequencing, may often distinguish modes of transmission in particular cases. Persons with genetically related infections who had no face-to-face proximity during the period when any of them were symptomatic would imply that transmission did not occur by droplets. Other combinations of proximity and spatiotemporal overlap for persons with genetically related infections would imply other modes of transmission.</p>
      <p>The everyday movements of humans create the dynamic links that connect populations and enable geographic spread and sustained transmission of infectious diseases. Difficulties in measuring these types of human movements, traditionally estimated using travel surveys, road networks, or small-scale global positioning system (GPS) studies, have long hindered efforts to understand these dynamics. Mobile phone data in the form of call data records (containing information about the location of the mobile phone tower used during a call from a mobile phone) provide one of today's most exciting opportunities to study human mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Gonzalez1">[21]</xref> and its influence on disease dynamics. Analogously, advances in wearable devices have radically improved our capability to track human contacts at high spatial and temporal resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Cattuto1">[22]</xref>, affording a much more detailed characterization and understanding of social behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Pentland1">[23]</xref>, complementing previous work based on large-scale surveys and self-reported information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Mossong1">[24]</xref>. Objective measurements of social contact and mobility networks complement self-reported data and pave the way to a more accurate description of infectious disease dynamics. In particular, high quality data are needed to improve parameterization of large-scale computer simulation disease models. The introduction of these models has enabled us to broaden the traditional modeling perspective to encompass large numbers of individuals, rather than population aggregates. Mobile phone data have already been used to create realistic models of human mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Gonzalez1">[21]</xref>, predict the rate of spread of drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Lynch1">[25]</xref>, assess the prospects of malaria eradication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Tatem1">[26]</xref>, and monitor population movements during the Haiti cholera outbreak in near real-time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Bengtsson1">[4]</xref>. Models based on recorded sequences of human contacts can inform the design of containment measures and of targeted immunization strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Salath2">[27]</xref> and marks an important departure from the static representation of contact networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Stehl1">[28]</xref>. Large-scale mobility data can be used to map the worldwide circulation of emerging infectious diseases such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Balcan1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Merler1">[30]</xref>. In other words, data are increasingly shaping the development of computer simulations that create <italic>in silico</italic> experiments hardly feasible in real systems with the goal of providing better scenario analysis for the policy making process and crisis management.</p>
      <p>The technical challenges in all these efforts are significant. The collection, storage, and analysis of massively large data sets is made through the interface of infrastructure, software, and sophisticated algorithms. The infrastructure requirements include high bandwidth, low-latency computer networks, access to vast amounts of storage, and the availability of large clusters of machines for computation. Through state-of-the-art innovations in the cloud computing industry, unparalleled computational power and storage resources can be leased on-demand and economically. Given the real-time, large-scale demands of scientific data today, data collection and storage software need to run continuously, impervious to hardware, software, and network failure. A further challenge is the design of algorithms and data structures that are efficient and scalable for processing, mining, and analyzing dynamic and large-scale epidemiologic data. This requires the adaptation of current algorithms to run on computer clusters (cloud or dedicated), and the development of new algorithms that leverage emerging data processing techniques such as MapReduce, a programming model for processing large data sets in parallel on large distributed computer systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Dean1">[31]</xref>. In addition, the extraction of knowledge (e.g., filtering, classification, anomaly detection) requires cutting-edge data mining algorithms specifically designed for the context of epidemiology. These challenges require a new breed of practitioners, combining epidemiologic expertise, analytical expertise, and advanced computational skills. They also require a curiosity to keep up with the fast pace at which novel communication tools are adopted. The adoption of social media services by hundreds of millions of people in just a few years is staggering to contemplate. At the same time, novel data streams always require careful consideration of potential biases. For example, a recent Pew Internet study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Smith1">[32]</xref> of Twitter users in the United States found significant differences among age groups, race/ethnicity groups, and among geographic locations.</p>
      <p>Finally, challenges regarding data access, data sharing, and privacy need our constant attention. Some of the electronic traces that we leave as digital citizens are meant to be public, while others are not, resulting in ethical and legal challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Boyd1">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, while it is easy to imagine the potential benefits of extracting information from big data, access to such data is often limited, costly, or altogether impossible for many in the research community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002616-Manovich1">[34]</xref>. There is also substantial variability in the sharing of data after it has been analyzed, an issue that is particularly problematic when dealing with very large data volumes because numerous—often subjective—filters need to be applied to make the original, noisy data suitable for analysis. What's more, while some data sources are legally accessible, their sharing is often not. These challenges notwithstanding, we believe that a digital epidemiology will on balance have substantial societal benefits due to the great improvements in the speed, scope, and focus of information available for public health purposes. And indeed, while these challenges still remain significant obstacles, web- and phone-based data mining is already having immediate impact on the operational activities of public health agencies worldwide.</p>
