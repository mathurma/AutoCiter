<abstract>
<p>Advances in high-throughput, single cell gene expression are allowing interrogation of cell heterogeneity. However, there is concern that the cell cycle phase of a cell might bias characterizations of gene expression at the single-cell level. We assess the effect of cell cycle phase on gene expression in single cells by measuring 333 genes in 930 cells across three phases and three cell lines. We determine each cell's phase non-invasively without chemical arrest and use it as a covariate in tests of differential expression. We observe bi-modal gene expression, a previously-described phenomenon, wherein the expression of otherwise abundant genes is either strongly positive, or undetectable within individual cells. This bi-modality is likely both biologically and technically driven. Irrespective of its source, we show that it should be modeled to draw accurate inferences from single cell expression experiments. To this end, we propose a semi-continuous modeling framework based on the generalized linear model, and use it to characterize genes with consistent cell cycle effects across three cell lines. Our new computational framework improves the detection of previously characterized cell-cycle genes compared to approaches that do not account for the bi-modality of single-cell data. We use our semi-continuous modelling framework to estimate single cell gene co-expression networks. These networks suggest that in addition to having phase-dependent shifts in expression (when averaged over many cells), some, but not all, canonical cell cycle genes tend to be co-expressed in groups in single cells. We estimate the amount of single cell expression variability attributable to the cell cycle. We find that the cell cycle explains only 5%–17% of expression variability, suggesting that the cell cycle will not tend to be a large nuisance factor in analysis of the single cell transcriptome.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Recent technological advances have enabled the measurement of gene expression in individual cells, revealing that there is substantial variability in expression, even within a homogeneous cell population. In this paper, we develop new analytical methods that account for the intrinsic, stochastic nature of single cell expression in order to characterize the effect of cell cycle on gene expression at the single-cell level. Applying these methods to populations of asynchronously cycling cells, we are able to identify large numbers of genes with cell cycle-associated expression patterns. By measuring and adjusting for cellular-level factors, we are able to derive estimates of co-expressing gene networks that more closely reflect cellular-level processes as opposed to sample-level processes. We find that cell cycle phase only accounts for a modest amount of the overall variability of gene expression within an individual cell. The analytical methods demonstrated in this paper are universally applicable to single cell expression data and represent a promising tool to the scientific community.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the advent of single cell expression profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Chen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Kalisky1">[4]</xref>, the assessment of cell population heterogeneity and identification of cell subpopulations from mRNA expression is achievable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Jensen1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Buganim1">[7]</xref>. However, at the single cell level, there is concern that cell cycle might interfere with the characterization of gene expression variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Chen2">[8]</xref>. As many biological samples are prepared from asynchronous cell populations, where each cell is in an unknown phase of the cell cycle, it is imperative to understand the impact of cell cycle in order to account for its effect on observed expression patterns and downstream data analysis. Here, we have measured mRNA expression and cell cycle from 930 single cells derived from three cell lines in order to explore this hypothesis.</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of single-cell gene expression data is the bimodality of expression values. Genes can be on (and a positive expression measure is recorded) or off (and the recorded expression is zero or negligible) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-McDavid1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Shalek1">[10]</xref>. This dichotomous characteristic of the data prevents use of the typical tools of designed experiments such as linear modeling and analysis of variance (ANOVA). We develop a novel computational framework to overcome this problem. First, a probabilistic mixture model-based framework allows the separation of positive expression values from background noise using gene-specific thresholds. After signal separation by thresholding, we model separately the frequency of expression (the fraction of cells expressing a gene) and the continuous, positive expression values. Our semi-continuous framework combines evidence from the two salient parameters of single cell expression in a statistically appropriate manner, an approach dubbed the Hurdle model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Cragg1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Jones1">[12]</xref>. Extending our previous proposal of a two-sample semi-continuous test akin to the two-sample <italic>t-test</italic>, our new framework allows for testing arbitrary contrasts and allows the use of variance components/mixed models, thus bringing to bear the full power of the general linear model.</p>
<p>The Hurdle model allows us to identify many genes with an archetypal cell cycle expression pattern despite a frequently bimodal distribution of expression. It also suggests that stochastic variation in single cell gene expression is relatively large compared to the effect of cell cycle. We find that even in the most tightly regulated gene, cell cycle explains only 27% of the variability, while in the median gene in our data set, cell cycle explains 5%–18% of the variability, depending on the assumptions we make regarding latent technical variability. The semi-continuous model also provides a framework for estimating co-expression networks– in which edges connect genes whose partial correlations remain after removing the effect of all other genes – while adjusting for population-level nuisance factors that could bias network inference. Applying this framework to our data, we show that only a subset of canonical cell cycle genes are highly co-expressed in single cells.</p>

<title>Periodic expression associated with cell cycle is observed at the single-cell level</title>
<p>In order to assess differential expression associated with actively cycling cells, expression of 333 genes was interrogated in 930 cells, across three cell lines: H9 (HTB-176), MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26), and PC3 (CRL-1435) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Single cell expression was measured from flow-sorted cells and compared between cell cycle phases and cell lines via nCounter single cell profiling, a multiplexed hybridization-based detection technology that utilizes fluorescent barcodes to count individual target nucleic acid molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Geiss1">[13]</xref>. This platform has been recently adapted to enable expression profiling from single cells via hybridization after a multiplexed target enrichment (MTE) in which mRNA is first converted to cDNA and then amplified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Yosef1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<p>Each cell was categorized as being in G0/G1, S or G2/M phase by measuring DNA content via flow-cytometry based on retention of Hoechst dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003696.s001">S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Bhmer1">[15]</xref>. Probes were selected for cell cycle associated genes (n = 119). These genes provided coverage of the entire cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003696.s008">Data Set S1</xref>) based on peak expression and periodicity information obtained from Cyclebase, an integrated database of bulk cell cycle expression profiling experiments that scores and ranks genes based on strength of evidence for a cell cycle associated expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Gauthier1">[16]</xref>. Probes were also included for non-cell-cycle associated genes with primary roles in the inflammatory response, and housekeeping controls without a Cyclebase ranking (n = 214). We denote probes with a Cyclebase rank (i.e. genes with the strongest evidence for cell cycle associated periodic expression) as the <italic>ranked</italic> set.</p>
<p>253 genes were expressed and passed quality control (see Methods). Genes showed a bimodal expression pattern in log-transformed mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g002">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with a burst-model of “on/off” transcription at the single cell level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Tan1">[17]</xref> and consistent with the kinetics of PCR amplification with low starting template concentrations, described by us and other authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-McDavid1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Shalek1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<p>Expression levels for each gene were most different between cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Many genes, including those in the <italic>ranked</italic> set showed cell line-specific expression patterns. For example, expression of TOP2A in G0/G1 varied from 70% of cells in MB-231 and PC3 to nearly universal in H9. This cell line effect was a nuisance factor we needed to adjust for in differential expression tests on cell cycle.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many genes from the <italic>ranked</italic> set, such as KIF23, TOP2A, HJURP, NUSAP1, and TPX2 exhibited expression patterns consistent with cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g002">Figure 2</xref> also reveals that changes in both the positive expression mean (i.e. the mean over the cells expressing that gene; PEM), and changes in the frequency of cells expressing a gene, occur throughout the cell cycle. The frequency and PEM in these genes also vary widely between cell lines, so it was important to adjust for cell line effects for accurate assessment of differential expression.</p>
<p>In order to test for significant differences in expression between cell cycle phases that were consistent across cell lines, we developed an ANOVA-like model (Hurdle model, see Methods) that permits adjustment for additive effects due to cell line. The Hurdle model improves the power to detect changes in single-cell expression by testing both the frequency of expression (corresponding to the relative distribution of cells between the two modes), and the PEM. Combining evidence from the discrete and continuous components of the data provides better sensitivity to changes in expression compared to test statistics based on frequencies of expression (discrete) or on the PEM (continuous) alone; or a union test (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) while remaining competitive in specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003696.s003">Figures S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003696.s004">S4</xref>)</p>
<p>Within the three cell lines tested here, <italic>significant</italic> differential expression (Bonferroni-adjusted for 253 tests at P&lt;0.05) was observed for 78 genes in the <italic>ranked</italic> set and 28 genes in the <italic>unranked</italic> set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Genes showing the strongest cell cycle associated expression patterns in bulk measurements were more likely to be identified as significant in the single-cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>).</p>

(C) Cumulative number of significant (red) or all (blue) <italic>ranked</italic> genes versus Cyclebase rank. Genes with lower Cyclebase rank, and hence stronger evidence of cycle regulation in bulk expression, are detected more often than genes with weaker evidence as shown by the minimal gap between significant (red) and all (blue) <italic>ranked</italic> gene lines at Cyclebase rank &lt;150.</p>

<p>For each gene, peak time was determined based on the phase (G0/G1, S or G2/M) with maximum average expression across all cell lines. Despite large cell-line-specific expression variability, peak times were broadly consistent with Cyclebase annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and especially so within the subset of genes with strongest evidence of cycle regulation in our data (e.g. Bonferroni significant at P&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>The majority of genes in the <italic>unranked</italic> set (115/143 or 80%) did not exhibit significant cell cycle effects, in concordance with their primary roles in functions unrelated to the cell cycle. Of the 28 <italic>unranked</italic> genes that exhibited a significant cell cycle phase association, we noted genes involved in cytoskeletal organization (PLAT), proliferation (PDGFA), and signaling pathways (IFNA1, IFNB1) that have been previously demonstrated to modulate progression through the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Naka1">[18]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell cycle explains a small portion of the gene expression variability</title>
<p>It has been argued that a substantial portion of the stochastic variability observed in single cell gene expression experiments may be caused by global changes in transcription due to cell cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Zopf1">[19]</xref>. We explore this idea by examining the proportional change in the Hurdle model fit associated with inclusion and omission of cell cycle as an explanatory variable. Because the Hurdle model accounts for both the dichotomous (on/off) and continuous nature of single cell data, the change in deviance (generalized linear model log-likelihood) between nested models can be used to calculate the amount of variability explained by cell cycle. The total deviance can be partitioned into components corresponding to cell cycle effects, nuisance effects described below, and residual effects. The ratio of cell cycle deviance to the sum of cell cycle plus residual deviance can then be interpreted as the analog to the coefficient of determination in linear least squares.</p>
<p>We consider expression changes due to main effects and interactions of <italic>cell cycle</italic> by <italic>cell line</italic> and account for amplification efficiency and average cell line effect (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Only modest amounts of the single cell expression variability can be explained by cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Within the <italic>ranked</italic> gene set, cell cycle phase explains 8% of the deviance in the median gene and 27% of the deviance in the top gene (TOP2A). In <italic>unranked</italic> genes, phase explains only 5% of the deviance in the median gene.</p>
<fig id="pcbi-1003696-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003696.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption>

The deflated scale on the secondary y-axis (right) shows the deviance as a percentage of the most completely explained gene (TOP2A, 27%) and is intended as an upper bound for the amount of remaining biological deviance in non-cell-cycle genes. Under this conservative rescaling, cell cycle explains only 25% of the deviance in 75% of unranked genes.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003696.g004" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>To derive these estimates, it is important to be able to account for the nuisance factors by using the Hurdle model. If cell-to-cell variation in amplification efficiency is not removed, we underestimate the explanatory power of cell cycle on in the median ranked gene by 26% since the unmodeled deviance would include this large additional component. Similarly, other unmeasured factors may inflate the residual deviance and attenuate the apparent role of cell cycle. These factors could include errors in inferring the cell cycle phase via FACS or imperfect modeling of changes in amplification or detection efficiency between samples. To guard against this attenuation, we set an upper bound on cell-cycle-dependent variation as follows: We suppose that transcription of the gene with the most deviance attributable to cell cycle (TOP2A, 27%) would be entirely regulated in a phase-dependent manner, and we characterize other genes' cell-cycle-dependent deviance relative to this maximum. For example, a gene with 13.5% cell-cycle-dependent deviance has half as strong a cell cycle effect as TOP2A, leading to the conclusion that at most 50% of this gene's deviance could be attributable to cell cycle. Even under these generous upper bounds, cell cycle phase explains only 18% (eg, .05/.27) and 29% (eg, .08/.27) of the deviance in the median gene in the <italic>unranked</italic> and <italic>ranked</italic> sets, respectively, suggesting that even when allowing for cell line-specific cell cycle effects, cycle is generally a small factor, compared to residual variability, in gene expression variability in the human transcriptome.</p>

<title>Network analysis reveals gene co-expression at the single-cell level</title>
<p>Single-cell gene expression data sets have the resolution to reveal not only differential expression in response to biological variables like cell cycle phase, but also to provide insight into co-expression between genes at the cellular level (e.g. the influence of one gene on another's expression or the sharing of upstream regulatory elements). In bulk-gene expression data (e.g. microarrays), apparent co-expression arises from tissue-level factors inducing shared marginal changes in genes. For example, different radiation doses in samples will induce correlation amongst all the genes affected by radiation, regardless of whether these genes interact or even participate in the same biological processes. In contrast, single cell data allow isolation of co-expression arising from cellular-level factors, giving access to more fundamental biological relationships. If two genes are correlated across cells drawn from the same environment, then the two genes are likely to share an intimate biological relationship: they may be regulated by the same transcription factor, or one gene may directly regulate the other. The distinction between cellular and marginal co-expression follows from a probabilistic identity on conditional covariances (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>When cell cycle is not adjusted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g005">Figure 5 D–F</xref>), known cell cycle genes with strong evidence of marginal regulation comprise the majority of the network. These genes generally peak in phase G2/M, suggesting that the co-expression is mostly driven by the coincident peak in average expression. The networks adjusted for cell cycle at least partially remove marginal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g005">Figure 5 A–C</xref>). In some cell cycle genes, substantial evidence for co-expression remains, but now additional co-expression is detected in genes without a previously described cell cycle role. In the unadjusted estimates, marginal shifts in expression in canonical cell cycle genes overwhelm subtler co-expression in unranked genes. Even though cell cycle variability is modest compared to residual variability, cell cycle is a substantial source of <italic>biological</italic> variability in the ranked genes and is in a sense confounded with the co-expression patterns.</p>

<title>Coexpression networks estimated using the Hurdle model.</title>
<p>Data from three cell lines and three cycles are combined and adjusted for additive effects of cell line and pre-amplification efficiency. Networks of the top 60 edges (ranked by partial correlation) using logistic regressions on discretized expression (A,D), linear regressions on positive, continuous expression values (B,E), and combining the top 30 edges from discrete and continuous components are shown (C,F). Panels A–C adjust for additive cell cycle effects, while panels D–F are unadjusted. The shape of the node corresponds to the cycle with peak expression from cyclebase, while the saturation of the node corresponds to the ranking. Blue and green edges are partial correlations detected from discrete expression and continuous expression, respectively. Red edges are detected in both discrete and continuous expression.</p>

<p>In an attempt to quantify the performance of the Hurdle model and the effect of cell-cycle adjustments, we examined network properties when varying the number of edges. We call an edge <italic>peaktime concordant</italic> if it connects nodes that have the same peaktime annotated in cycle base (eg, G0/G1-G0/G1 or S-S). Over a range of network densities (30–240 edges) the unadjusted Hurdle or Raw networks contain between 45%–80% peaktime concordant edges, while the adjusted Hurdle contains only 32%–38% peaktime concordant edges.</p>
<p>Cell cycle adjustment in networks estimated on the raw data is not very effective compared to the unadjusted, raw networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003696.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This is unsurprising, as this would occur when the model for the mean of the response is mis-specified, as is true when ignoring the bi-modality that the data exhibit (eg, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003696.s002">S2</xref>). If the Hurdle model is correct and cell cycle is additive, then the identity link cannot recover this additivity. On the other hand, the Hurdle model can still recover an additive mean model under a linear link by taking the discrete coefficient estimates to be null. Overall, the adjusted and unadjusted Hurdle networks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g005">Figure 5</xref> are rather different, sharing 39% of nodes (Jaccard similarity) and 51% of edges (Hamming Distance/#edges).</p>
<p>Combining both discrete and continuous networks (with the top 30 edges from discrete and continuous networks) allows a richer set of genes to be characterized. When discrete expression is used alone, networks primarily consist of G2/M peaking genes and unranked genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). When positive, continuous expression is also used, S and G0/G1 peaking genes enter the networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g005">Figure 5B–C</xref>).</p>
<p>The adjusted, semi-continuous network depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003696-g005">Figure 5C</xref> consists of two primary sub-networks, one consisting entirely of ranked genes, and another largely consisting of weakly ranked and unranked genes. While we cannot rule out that measurement error of the inferred cycle is not partially responsible for the persistence of a subset of ranked genes, previously described mutual regulation in RNA-interference experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Johnson1">[20]</xref> of some of these genes suggests that this subset is co-expressed at the single cell level as opposed to being co-expressed on average at the population level. The sub-network of ranked genes contains the central node of NUF2, a highly-conserved protein required for stable kinetochore localization of centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Liu1">[21]</xref>. NUF2 is connected to other actors in mitotic organization such as ANLN, KIF23, and CENPF, as well as the check-point genes CCNA2 and BUB1, reflecting the central role of these genes in mitosis.</p>
<p>The sub-network of primarily unranked genes contains two key nodes: TUBB and CCR3. The predominance of genes associated with cell growth, like TUBB, and transmembrane proteins, like CCR3, in the unranked cluster is likely related to the actively dividing nature of the profiled cells, i.e. dividing cells must generate new scaffolding and membrane-related materials to support growth. This relatively large sub-network of unranked and weakly ranked genes is largely missed by the unadjusted analysis that is biased by the population level cell-cycle effect.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Stochastic, bimodal expression is a hallmark of single cell data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Elowitz1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-McAdams1">[24]</xref>. Within a population of cells, detectable expression for any given gene typically resides in one of two modes, corresponding to an “on” or “off” state. Both technical and biological factors likely contribute to this bimodality. Quantities of some species of cDNA may be minute after reverse-transcription, and in this case random variation in the number of template-primer-enzyme complexes that form during each annealing phase may dominate the kinetics of the PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Boggy1">[25]</xref>. But regardless of its origin, modeling bimodality improves the power of differential expression tests.</p>
<p>Here, we show how the Hurdle model can be adapted to complex study designs, extending our previous results describing its use for two-sample comparisons. We demonstrate the model's ability to identify many genes with a periodic expression pattern from asynchronously cultured cells utilizing a combination of FACS sorting and these new analytical techniques, including genes with little previous evidence of cell cycle associated periodic expression like MEF2D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Ma1">[26]</xref> and FAM189B. The Hurdle model is able to identify phase-dependent patterns of expression despite the fact that G2 and M phases are indistinguishable by DNA content. The similar rank ordering of differentially expressed genes in our single cell experiment as compared to bulk experiments and concordance in the phase of peak expression demonstrates the power of the Hurdle model. While we have applied the Hurdle model to our specific problem, the approach is general and can be applied to test any effect of interest in a single-cell gene expression dataset. We offer this modeling framework as an R package for other interested users at github.com/RGLab/SingleCellAssay.</p>
<p>Although we recommend the Hurdle model in general for testing for differential expression, it should be noted that its desirability is contingent on the frequency of the gene under consideration. For example, if a gene is highly expressed (eg, &gt;90% expression), then the information to be derived from the 10% of cells that do not express a gene may not be worth the cost of an extra degree of freedom in the chi-square null distribution of the test statistic. However, even when this is the case, the Hurdle model might be preferred for methodological simplicity, since it is powered—although perhaps not always optimally—regardless of expression frequency, and does not require extensive pre-test simulations of power to yield acceptable performance. The data set considered here offers a relatively stringent test of the relative sensitivity of the Hurdle model, owing to the high expression frequency of the genes in this experiment (interquartile range ranked genes: .7–.9; unranked genes: .56–.88).</p>
<p>Single cell data also allows unparalleled resolution of genes' co-expression patterns. While bulk expression data can reveal correlation induced by varying biological conditions, single-cell data has the possibility to reveal co-expression driven by shared regulatory elements within the cell. However, when inferring gene expression networks, it is important to adjust for population level covariates that could confound the network estimation, especially for genes that are marginally affected by such a population level covariate (like known cell cycle genes in our experiment.) By measuring a limited set of cell cycle associated genes, we are able to identify a network of co-expressed genes with known roles in cell cycle regulation even after adjusting for cell cycle phase. It should be noted that the unadjusted network estimate would be appropriate in some circumstances, for example when a summary of the co-expression occurring on <italic>average</italic> in the <italic>population</italic> of cells is desired, as opposed to inference of co-expression occurring conditionally within defined subsets.</p>
<p>Work remains to derive network estimators that optimally combine information from discrete and continuous portions. Our current approach is likely theoretically naïve, since it is essentially a union test of the discrete and continuous portions, rather than a summation of signal from the two domains. We also have left unresolved the asymptotic consistency of our proposed network procedure under dimensional scaling.</p>
<p>It is crucial to understand the relationship between cell cycle and the stochastic nature of single cell expression as it determines the magnitude of the cell cycle's distorting effect on single cell analyses. In contrast to earlier estimates of Zopf <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Zopf1">[19]</xref> we find little evidence of periodic regulation of expression among non-cell cycle associated genes. Our results are consistent with genome-wide mRNA profiling efforts utilizing bulk expression methodologies in mammalian cells where genes with cycle-dependent periodic expression patterns are limited and well-characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Gauthier1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Whitfield1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Cho1">[28]</xref>. Disparity between our findings and those of Zopf <italic>et al.</italic> may arise from differences between yeast and mammalian cells. Moreover, Zopf <italic>et al.</italic> primarily focus on a single, synthetic promoter while we sample hundreds of transcripts presumably driven by many different promoters. Whether the substantial remaining variability is inherent to the human single cell, or due to thus far latent, unmeasured biological variables remains to be explored.</p>

First, higher-order axes of variation corresponded to identifiable biological factors (e.g., phase, cell line). Orthogonality of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003696.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the biological axes of variation suggested that this factor was technical in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Alter1">[31]</xref>. Secondly, many steps in deriving cDNA from live cells could induce technical, cell-specific variation. These steps include incomplete lysis, variation in reverse transcription to generate cDNA and efficiency differences in the multiplexed, amplicon-specific pre-amplification step.

<p>We extend the conditional, neighborhood-based algorithm of Meinshausen-Bulmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Meinshausen1">[36]</xref> to estimate co-expression networks using the Hurdle model. The standard Meinshausen-Bulmann algorithm uses L1-penalized regressions to estimate partial correlations between vertices (genes) by treating each vertex as a dependent variable in a regression that includes all other vertices as independent variables. If the vertices are jointly Gaussian, non-zero coefficients correspond to statistical dependences between vertices, conditional on all other factors and so reflect a Gauss-Markov Random Field. Here, since the distribution of expression in single cells is not multivariate Gaussian, edges in our network correspond to conditional correlations (after possible application of the logit link). Although we do not attempt to show consistency of our proposed approach here, we note that Meinshausen-Bulmann-like methods have been shown to be consistent in estimating non-Gaussian graphical models under fairly general conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Yang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003696-Ravikumar1">[38]</xref>.</p>

<p><bold>The percent of edges joining nodes with same marginal peak time (A) and percent nodes in top 100 of CycleBase (B) as the number of edges in the network varies from 30–240.</bold> The hurdle adjusted for cell cycle selects half as many edges with the same peaktime compared to the adjusted or unadjusted raw models, while the unadjusted hurdle selects modestly more peaktime concordant edges than the raw models, especially for richer (&gt;100 edges) networks. A similar phenomenon occurs when examining the distribution of nodes. The unadjusted hurdle tends to select more nodes with previous description of marginal expression regulation. After adjustment, it selects the fewest nodes out of the four models.</p>
