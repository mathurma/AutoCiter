<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The advent of functional genomics has enabled the genome-wide characterization of the molecular state of cells and tissues, virtually at every level of biological organization. The difficulty in organizing and mining this unprecedented amount of information has stimulated the development of computational methods designed to infer the underlying structure of regulatory networks from observational data. These important developments had a profound impact in biological sciences since they triggered the development of a novel data-driven investigative approach. In cancer research, this strategy has been particularly successful. It has contributed to the identification of novel biomarkers, to a better characterization of disease heterogeneity and to a more in depth understanding of cancer pathophysiology. However, so far these approaches have not explicitly addressed the challenge of identifying networks representing the interaction of different cell types in a complex tissue. Since these interactions represent an essential part of the biology of both diseased and healthy tissues, it is of paramount importance that this challenge is addressed. Here we report the definition of a network reverse engineering strategy designed to infer directional signals linking adjacent cell types within a complex tissue. The application of this inference strategy to prostate cancer genome-wide expression profiling data validated the approach and revealed that normal epithelial cells exert an anti-tumour activity on prostate carcinoma cells. Moreover, by using a Bayesian hierarchical model integrating genetics and gene expression data and combining this with survival analysis, we show that the expression of putative cell communication genes related to focal adhesion and secretion is affected by epistatic gene copy number variation and it is predictive of patient survival. Ultimately, this study represents a generalizable approach to the challenge of deciphering cell communication networks in a wide spectrum of biological systems.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In the current era of cancer research, stimulated by the release of the entire human genome, it has become increasingly clear that to understand cancer we need to understand how the many thousands of genes and proteins involved interact. Modern techniques have enabled the collection of unprecedented amounts of high quality data describing the state of these molecules during cancer development. In cancer research particularly, this strategy has been particularly successful, leading to the discovery of new drugs able to target key factors promoting cancer growth. However, a large body of research suggests that in complex organs, the interaction between cancer and its surrounding environment is an essential part of the biology of both diseased and healthy tissues, therefore it is of paramount importance that this process is further investigated. Here we report a strategy designed to reveal communication signals between cancer cells and adjacent cell types. We apply the strategy to prostate cancer and find that normal cells surrounding the tumour do exert an anti-tumour activity on prostate cancer cells. By using a statistical model which integrates multiple levels of genetic data, we show that cell-to-cell communication genes are controlled by DNA alterations and have potential prognostic value.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostate Cancer is the most common cancer in males. It is characterized by a considerable molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity that results in radically different clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The role of tumour microenvironment in the development of cancer is crucial. More specifically, the expression of growth and motility factors, extracellular matrix components produced by stromal cells, is linked to the pathophysiology of the tumour and it often predictive of clinical outcome. Stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells secrete many factors that influence the expansion of the tumour. For example, they secrete most of the enzymes involved in extracellular matrix breakdown and produce growth factors that control tumour cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref002">2</xref>]. They also secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, which play a major role in a wide spectrum of pathophysiology mechanisms (e.g. chemo attraction, neoplastic transformation, angiogenesis, tumour clonal expansion and growth, passage through the ECM, intravasation into blood or lymphatic vessels and the non-random homing of tumour metastasis to specific sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref003">3</xref>]. In addition to tumour promoting factors, they also secrete tumour suppressor factors that can potentially have an anti-tumour effect on adjacent tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref004">4</xref>]. Current research on the role of stroma is principally focused on immune cells fibroblasts and cells of the vasculature such as endothelial cells. However, since other cell types, such as normal epithelial cells, also produce a number of these factors, such as IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref005">5</xref>], TNFα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref006">6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref007">7</xref>] and TGFβ1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref007">7</xref>] it is reasonable to hypothesize that they may also play an important role in influencing the molecular and physiological state of tumour cells.</p>
<p>The intricacy in the biology of cell-to-cell communication and the relatively small amount of available knowledge makes understanding the biological networks underlying the development of tumour microenvironment a suitable challenge for a systems-level approach. The powerful combination of functional genomics and computational biology have contributed to the discovery of novel signaling networks in the biology of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref008">8</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref009">9</xref>], including cell communication networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref010">10</xref>]. However, so far there has been no attempt to develop a completely data-driven systems biology approach to discover novel cell-communication networks.</p>
<p>Here we describe a data-driven strategy we developed to address this challenge. Our approach is designed to “learn” the underlying structure of cell-to-cell communication networks from functional genomics datasets, representing the transcriptional state of normal and adjacent tumour cells.</p>
<p>The application of this novel analysis strategy to prostate cancer revealed genes whose expression is associated to directional signals linking normal and tumour epithelial cells. Remarkably, experimental validation of our predictions using an in vitro co-culture system recapitulated the predicted transcriptional response and revealed that normal epithelial cells have the potential to revert some of the phenotypic traits of tumour cells. Moreover, by integrating genetics, gene expression and tumour features in a single conceptual model, we were able to show that putative cell communication networks, involved in focal adhesion and protein secretion are perturbed by genetic mutations and that are linked to survival.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the experimental validation of the hypothesis generated from the model support the approach we have developed, which explicitly search for candidate directional signals between different cell types. Its application to a wider range of biological systems is likely to have a profound impact in the field of functional genomics.</p>

<title>Overview of the analysis and validation strategy</title>
<p>Our study is based on a data analysis workflow which includes reverse engineering techniques to identify gene expression signatures that may be involved in cell to cell communications. The strategy we followed, which is summarized in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g001">Fig 1</xref>,</bold> is based on several cycles of computational analysis, hypothesis generation and experimental validation. The workflow consisted of five distinct but interconnected steps.</p>

<title>Step 1</title>
<p>Correlation analysis of a gene expression profiling dataset linking genes expressed in normal and tumor epithelial cells. The analysis of the resulting network with a novel topological index (<italic>polarization index</italic>) identified candidate genes involved in cell-to-cell communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Step 2</title>
<p>The application of two different statistical approaches shows that the cell communication candidate genes represent gene signatures that are statistically robust, such that they could not be generated by random chance or by issues of sample purity. Moreover, functional analysis shows that candidate genes are enriched in functional terms representing multiple hallmarks of cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Step 3</title>
<p>Experimental validation: Expression profiling. By using a transwell based cell co-culture system we show that changes in gene expression in normal and tumor cells induced by co-culture recapitulate the signatures predicted by co-expression analysis and representing multiple hallmarks of cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Step 4</title>
<p>Experimental validation: Cell Biology. By using a transwell based cell co-culture system in conjunction with several cell biology assays we show that the presence of normal cells decreases the aggressiveness of tumor cells and that such reduction in survival can be reproduced in tumor cells by exposing them to a recombinant protein encoded by one of the most statistically significant cell communication gene candidates,</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Step 5</title>
<p>Clinical validation. By using a publicly available clinical study, including multilevel genomics and functional genomics data as well as clinical outcome, we prove that the expression of a significant number of cell communication candidates identified by our procedure can be explained by methylation or correlate with genetic mutations and are predictive of clinical outcome. We also show that the expression of these genes is higher in normal tissue with respect to adjacent normal and tumor tissue.</p>

<title>A gene co-expression network reveal transcriptional signatures linking adjacent tumour and normal epithelial cells</title>
<p>The overarching goal of this project was to develop a data driven strategy to identify molecular pathways involved in cell-to-cell crosstalk. We first set to test whether gene expression profiles across normal samples may correlate with the gene expression profiles from the matching tumour samples. We reasoned that if such correlated profiles exist they might be a manifestation of the signaling events between normal and tumour epithelial cells and may shed new light on the role of normal epithelia in prostate cancer.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we first applied relevance networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref011">11</xref>], a relatively simple network inference procedure, to link genes differentially expressed in normal and in tumour epithelia. We used a dataset developed by Singh <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref012">12</xref>], representing the transcriptional state of 47-paired prostate tumour and adjacent normal cells samples. The resulting network (NT network) is composed of 2581 positively and negatively correlated genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>). These were subdivided in 1600 gene expression profiles in normal epithelia (referred from now on as ‘<italic>normal-expressed</italic>’ genes) and 981 gene expression profiles in tumour epithelia (referred from now on as ‘<italic>tumour-expressed genes</italic>’. The NT network was grouped into 68 modules by using GLay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref013">13</xref>], a community detection method that maximizes inter-module connectivity. Only three modules contained more than twenty nodes and thus were selected for further investigation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>). This arbitrary threshold was used to make sure that a sufficiently large number of genes was present in each module for subsequent functional analysis.

<title>A novel topological index identifies putative directional signals linking normal and tumour epithelial cells</title>
<p>The results described above (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>) are consistent with the notion that a relatively small number of genes expressed in either normal or tumour epithelial cells may control communication signals that can either modify or respond to the molecular state of the adjacent tissue.</p>
<p>In order to mine the NT network for such signals we developed the polarization index (<italic>pol</italic>), a novel gene connectivity metric. We design this index to represent genes that may exert an effect on the adjacent cell type only when expressed in one specific tissue. This scenario implies a directional signal, which is for example typical of soluble factors encoded by tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes. In the case of tumour suppressor genes, these may have lost the ability to control tumour cell proliferation via autocrine signaling but they may retain that function when expressed in adjacent stromal cells by a paracrine signal.</p>
<p>We formalized this scenario as follows:</p>
<p>Considering that a given gene <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> can be expressed in both normal and tumour tissue, we define <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> as the number of tumour-expressed genes that correlate with the normal-expressed <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Similarly, we define <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> as the number of normal-expressed genes that correlate with the tumour-expressed <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. We define the polarization coefficient for gene <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> as:

<p>Functional analysis of the polarized genes using Gene Ontology and the Ingenuity database shows a statistically significant enrichment in functions key to cancer biology (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>)</bold>.

<title>Predicted targets of polarized genes in tumour and normal epithelial cells represent a set of important cancer effector functions</title>
<p>In order to investigate the potential role of polarised genes in cell-to-cell communication we first identified their first neighbours in the NT network and then we tested the resulting gene lists for functional enrichment. We could identify 1223 normal-expressed genes as targets of tumour-expressed negatively polarised genes and 794 tumour-expressed genes as targets of normal-expressed positively polarised genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s013">S4 Table</xref></bold>). We discovered that there was a significant overlap between them (520 genes, p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>) suggesting that although positively and negatively polarised genes are by definition different, they may ultimately target the same biological processes, in tumour and normal cells respectively. This hypothesis was supported by the functional analysis, which identified a set of terms enriched in the overlapping set of gene targets. Among these there were <italic>regulation of cell death</italic>, <italic>response to growth factor</italic>, <italic>cell adhesion</italic> and <italic>extracellular region part</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s012">S3 Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s014">S5 Table</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>An <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture system recapitulates the transcriptional changes predicted by the gene polarization analysis</title>
<p>We reasoned that if the cell-to-cell communication model we developed around the gene polarization index is correct, we should be able to modulate the putative targets of polarized genes by reconstructing an <italic>in vitro</italic> system where normal and tumour prostate cells share the same micro-environment. We performed such experiment by using a trans-well co-culture system where normal (RWPE1) and tumour (DU-145) epithelial cell lines are separated by a semipermeable membrane. In these experiments either tumour or normal cells were inserted into dishes already containing tumour cells. This experimental set up represents the aspect of the prostate tissue in which cancer epithelial cells sits in proximity but not necessarily are in direct contact (paracrine signals). Four sets of samples were processed for expression profiling 24 hours after the start of the experiment. These were: 1) RWPE1 cultured with RWPE1, 2) DU-145 cultured with DU-145, 3) RWPE1 cultured in the presence of DU-145 and 4) DU145 cultured in the presence of RWPE1. Genes whose expression in tumour cells is influenced by the presence of normal cells were identified by direct comparison between gene expression in DU-145 cultured on their own and gene expression in DU-145 cultured in the trans-well system in the presence of RWPE1. Similarly, we identified genes whose expression in normal cells depended on the presence of tumour cells by direct comparison between gene expression in RWPE1 cultured on their own and RWPE1 grown in the trans-well system in the presence of DU145. We considered the two sets of genes identified by this simple differential expression analysis as the experimental equivalents of the predicted targets of positively and negatively polarized genes, respectively.</p>
<p>Consistent with the analysis of the targets of polarized genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>) we found a significant overlap between genes differentially expressed in normal and tumour cells as a result of co-culture (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>, p&lt;0.01). We also discovered that a significant percentage of genes up regulated in tumour cells were down regulated in normal cells and vice versa (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the results of a principal component analysis of these data showing that the variation between normal and tumour cells following co-culture followed anti-parallel trajectories (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Next, we compared the predicted targets of polarized genes and the experimentally determined transcriptional signatures. The overlap between the differentially expressed genes in the co-culture system and the predicted targets of polarized genes was significant both at gene (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>) and at functional level (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref></bold>). We concluded that remarkably, the <italic>in vitro</italic> system was able to recapitulate a significant component of the transcriptional network inferred from the clinical study.</p>
<p>The functional analysis of these gene signatures revealed enrichment in several important cellular functions that are very relevant in cancer (e.g. <italic>regulation of growth</italic>, <italic>apoptosis</italic> and <italic>cell adhesion</italic>). Since we could not identify a specific direction in differential gene expression we set to determine whether change in the transcriptional state of co-cultured cells impact a relevant cancer phenotype. We therefore performed a battery of <italic>in vitro</italic> tests on tumour cells, using the same trans-well co-culture system described above. Here we assessed whether the transcriptional signatures defined by our computational analysis and validated by the <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture system may truly reflect a cancer relevant phenotype. We found that the presence of normal epithelial cells induced several phenotypic changes in tumour cells. More specifically, population doubling time (PDT) in tumour cells cultured in the presence of normal cells was considerably longer than in tumour cells cultured on their own (30 hours against 18 hours, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). Cell numbers at the end of the experiment were consistent with this finding and also revealed that additional tumour cells in the trans-well promoted survival (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). The apoptosis test revealed that normal cells did not have any effect but tumour cells surprisingly increased the number of tumour apoptotic cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). We then tested the formation of cell clusters and recorded the number of cell clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g005">Fig 5D</xref></bold>), the size of clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>) and the area of the dish occupied by single cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g005">Fig 5F</xref></bold>). Normal cells reduced the number and size of clusters and increased the area occupied by single cells whereas tumour cells had the opposite effect (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g005">Fig 5D–5F</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>In each panel is shown the phenotypic characteristic of the tumour cells alone (DU145, no insert), the tumour cells in the presence of normal (RWPE1) or tumour cells (DU145). The presence of normal cells are seen to (A) increase the population doubling time (PDT), (B) decrease the total cell number, (C) have no significant effect on apoptosis, (D) decrease the number and (E) size of the cell clusters and (F) increase the number of single cells. Each of these changes shows a normalisation of the phenotypic characteristics of the tumour cells by the presence of the normal cells. In contrast co-culture with DU145 tumour cells is seen to have the opposite effect and to increase the tumour phenotype of the tumour cells. Panel G shows the results of a clonogenic assay performed on two different tumour cell lines (DU145 and PC-1). The figure shows that the addition of 1:50 dilution of culture media, conditioned by over-expressing Slit-2 induce at least 60% reduction in cell survival respect to control cultures.</p>

Next we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify whether epistatic CNV could explain the expression of polarized genes in tumour cells. We were able to show that the expression of 70 polarised genes could be explained by CNV in seven genomic regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s018">S9 Table</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>). Three of these included genes with known function (<italic>ATAD1</italic>, <italic>GRHL2</italic> and <italic>KCNB2</italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s019">S10 Table</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the large majority of polarized genes whose expression was linked to CNV were mainly positively polarised (59 out of 70).</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether the expression of polarised genes was related to tumour features and clinical outcome. Indeed we found that the expression of a large number of polarised genes (130) was linked to Gleason score. A smaller number of genes (18 and 1) were linked to PSA antigen and T stage, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s020">S11 Table</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The integration of these associations using a network representation revealed 173 polarised genes linked either to regions affected by CNV (89 genes) and/or to tumour features (84 genes) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>). Remarkably, while the expression of none of the polarised genes could be linked to survival, 132 of them were linked to time free of recurrence (FDR&lt;5%, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s016">S7A Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s021">S12 Table</xref></bold>). Interestingly we could also show that polarised genes linked to CNV did show significantly lower p-values than polarised genes only linked to Gleason score (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s007">S7B Fig</xref></bold>) supporting the clinical relevance of the epistatic effects identified by the computational model.</p>
<p>A group of 58 positively polarised genes and 6 negatively polarised genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s007">S7B Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004884.t002">Table 2</xref></bold>) were linked to both CNV and Gleason score.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have described a relatively simple network inference and analysis procedure, explicitly designed to learn cell communication networks from observational data. This is the first example of an open ended reverse engineering strategy that explicitly searches for cell communication networks from observational data. Our approach also provides clues on the role of normal epithelial cells in prostate tumour progression. The application of our analysis strategy (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>) to prostate cancer revealed that normal epithelial cells may have a more important role in controlling tumour expansion than previously suspected. The applicability of this approach is broader and indeed it opens important avenues for better understanding the whole network of signals regulating cell communication in both normal and pathological scenarios.</p>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>The role of normal epithelial cells in tumour progression</title>
<p>Since the large majority of efforts have focused on understanding the role of fibroblast and endothelial cells in cancer, the interface between normal and transformed epithelial cells is still not clearly understood. Our analysis suggests that normal epithelial cells exert a “normalizing” effect on tumour cells, up to an advanced stage of tumour progression.</p>
<p>A number of recent studies have suggested that at the initial phase of tumour expansion, normal epithelia could provide a tumour suppressive environment that cancer cells need to overcome to develop a tumour. So far, tumour suppressor activity of normal epithelial cells has been studied in cell culture systems replicating early transformation events in epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref024">24</xref>]. These models include kidney and mammary epithelial cells in culture where only a few cells are selectively transformed by oncogenic transformation or inhibition of tumour suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref024">24</xref>]. In these conditions, transformed cells are excluded from the epithelia and out grown by normal epithelial cells. It has been suggested that additional mutations and/or alterations in the adhesion properties of tumour cells may be needed to overcome the tumour suppressive effects and allow for clonal expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the precise molecular events underlying this process are still unknown.</p>
<p>Our work therefore provides further evidence of the tumour suppressor effects of normal epithelial cells and supports the concept that although tumour cells obviously eventually overcome these normalizing signals, the effect of normal epithelia may be relevant for the entire clinical history of prostate cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Potential mechanisms mediating the anti-tumour activity of normal epithelial cells</title>
<p>The models we have developed provide a link between genetic mutations and the expression of polarized genes in tumour cells. Remarkably, the functional profile of mutated genes is consistent with a pivotal anti-tumour role of the apical junctional complex and the protein secretion machinery.</p>
<p>Among the three genes we have identified as potential epistatic regulators, GRHL2 is known to be a transcription factor known to play a pivotal role in cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref025">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref026">26</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref027">27</xref>]. GRHL2 regulates epithelial cell differentiation by effectively regulating the expression of genes of the epithelial apical junctional complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref028">28</xref>]. It controls the expression of the adherents junction gene E-cadherin and the tight junction gene claudin 4 (Cldn4) and has been linked to both pro and anti-tumour activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref025">25</xref>]. Moreover, GRHL2 up regulates the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene during cellular immortalization of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref029">29</xref>]; it is a proto-oncogene in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref025">25</xref>]; it regulates proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref030">30</xref>] and is a suppressor of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Our model predicts that increase expression of GRHL2 due to CNV down regulates the expression of a set of polarized genes that precisely encode for components of the cytoskeleton and are involved in focal adhesion and cell migration. Several of these genes are extracellular factors and one of them (SEC23A) has been found to control secretion of anti-tumour factors in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>These observations lead to the hypothesis that increased expression of GRHL2 in tumour cells may result in the deregulation of at least two different types of tumour suppressor signals, one dependent on the establishment of focal adhesion junctions and the other directly affecting secretion of anti-tumour factors. This chain of events may contribute to tumour transformation and metastases formation and at the same time could make tumour cells sensitive to the same tumour suppressor signals that continue to be produced by adjacent normal epithelial cells. The in vitro system we have used to validate our model shows that normal epithelial cells are able to exert anti-tumour effects even if normal and tumour epithelial cells were separated by a semi-permeable membrane, suggesting that soluble factors may be playing a major role in tumour suppression. Secretion of the highly positively polarized gene SLIT2 from normal epithelial cells has the potential of exerting a tumour suppressor activity as shown by our clonogenic assay on tumour cells exposed to diluted conditioned media.</p>
<p>More broadly, there is strong support in the literature linking several of the positively polarized genes to tumour suppression.</p>
<p>More precisely, FLNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref019">19</xref>] FBLN1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref020">20</xref>], MYL9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref021">21</xref>], CLIC4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref022">22</xref>] all have demonstrated tumour suppressor activity. It has been shown that Filamin A (FLNA) exerts anti-tumour activity via at least three different mechanisms. It represses MMP-9 expression reducing cell migration in prostate cancer. It controls focal adhesion and androgen-related cell migration in human fibrosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref019">19</xref>] and Cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 mediated cell migration in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref032">32</xref>]. The myosin light chain (MYL9) in stroma has been shown to predict malignant progression and recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref021">21</xref>]. Fibulin 1 (FBLN1) is down regulated in a number of tumours, including prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref033">33</xref>]. CLIC4 was first characterized as intracellular chloride channel, later shown to be involved in signaling, cytoskeleton integrity and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref034">34</xref>] and is a tumour suppressor gene in cutaneous squamous cell cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Computational inference of cell-to-cell communication networks</title>
<p>The reverse engineering approach we have adopted is based on the assumption that gene co-expression is either directly or indirectly a reflection of important underlying mechanisms of gene regulation and as such it can reveal novel biological networks. While this concept is well accepted in the scientific community, it remains true that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, hence the importance of experimental validation.</p>
<p>However, for a number of candidates, it is possible to hypothesize a mechanism whereby highly polarized genes may directly affect adjacent cells. For example, a number of them are secreted factors that can work as paracrine signals or membrane proteins known to be involved in cell communication (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004884.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>). This is the case for Slit-2 that we have experimentally verified by treating prostate cancer cells with conditioned media derived from cells over-expressing the recombinant protein. Others may indirectly control cell communication. This is for example the case with transcription factors (e.g. GATA2 control of IGF1 signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref035">35</xref>]), proteins controlling secretion (e.g. LTBP1 control of TGFB1 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref036">36</xref>]) or proteins involved in cell migration.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the gene expression profiling analysis we have performed to validate our predictions, suggest that the polarization coefficient may have the ability to capture directional signals that are triggered by normal and tumour cells. However, the experimental system we have used is based on a trans-well system, which only validate paracrine signals.</p>
<p>We believe our approach could have a broad impact. Although, at present there are not many suitable datasets containing both disease and adjacent normal tissue, we have verified that the distribution of polarization coefficient in two additional, datasets representing kidney and liver adjacent normal and tumour tissues are similar to the one observed in prostate cancer <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>). In the future we envisage that tissue laser micro dissection and mRNA sequencing technologies may provide a very powerful combination for the identification of genome wide cell communication networks.</p>

<title>Conclusions and further developments</title>
<p>The approach we have developed has the advantage to reverse engineer cell communication networks in the absence of any prior information. In this respect, the method is different from the recently developed computational method developed by Choi <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref010">10</xref>]. The latter has been successfully applied to understanding the relationship between stroma and cancer cells in a model of lung tumour metastases and is based on comprehensive ligand-receptor network information, which can be extracted from several knowledge databases. We envisage that the integration of these knowledge driven approach within the framework of statistical learning will allow the development of a more powerful set of methodologies.</p>
<p>The study we have performed relies on cross-sectional data and therefore the correlations we estimate do not take into consideration the hierarchical sequence of events that characterize cell communication dynamically. However, such dynamics can be captured using <italic>in vivo</italic> models of tumor expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref037">37</xref>]. In such scenarios, different computational methodologies may be used to reverse engineer underlying gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref038">38</xref>]. For example, suitable approaches may include ordinary differential equation (ODE) or state space models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, the approach we have pioneered is likely to provide a general strategy to ‘<italic>learn</italic>’ the structure of cell-to-cell communication networks in diseased and physiologically normal tissues. We anticipate that the availability of a viable strategy to infer cell communication networks will stimulate the development of experimental studies representing the molecular state of adjacent tissues and their functional interactions in physiology and disease.</p>

<title>Microarray datasets</title>
<p>This analysis initially focus on the dataset developed by Singh et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref012">12</xref>] representing the transcriptional state of 47 paired prostate tumour and adjacent normal cells samples. Raw Affymetrix microarray data were normalized and processed before analysis to remove low variant and low expressed genes. Further details of the procedures can be found in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s022">S1 File</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>The analysis linking copy number variation (CNV), gene expression, tumour features and clinical outcome was performed on the dataset developed by Taylor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref017">17</xref>], which consist of 231 tumour samples. Raw comparative genomic hybridization Agilent data was processed as detailed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s022">S1 File</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>The dataset developed by Tomlins <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref018">18</xref>] was used to test the expression of polarized genes in laser capture micro-dissected low and high-grade tumour and normal prostate tissue. In the Tomlins et al study, tumour grading was determined by Gleason score. A scores of 3 determined a low-grade tumour, a score of 4 or greater determined a high-grade tumour. Raw data was downloaded and normalized using the “marray” BioConductor package in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>All data processing was performed in the statistical environment R.</p>

<title>Network inference</title>
<p>Network inference was performed using a relevance network approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref011">11</xref>]. Non-linear Spearman ranking correlation (<bold>r</bold><sub><bold>s</bold></sub>) was used to infer gene-to-gene correlations. In order to estimate the number of significant correlations, 100 bootstrap versions of the original dataset were used for each dataset to draw the null distribution of <bold>r</bold><sub><bold>s</bold></sub> expected by chance. The bootstrap distribution was used to estimate a p-value, which was subsequently corrected for multiple-test using an FDR correction procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref041">41</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). The use of the relevance networks based on the Spearman correlation coefficient has advantages respect to more complex reverse engineering methods such as the mutual information based ARACNE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref042">42</xref>] algorithm. Spearman correlation measure both positive and negative correlations and is better suited for datasets with a smaller number of samples. We used a threshold of <bold>r</bold><sub><bold>s</bold></sub> &gt;|0.75| (FDR&lt;10<sup>−2</sup>) to select significant connections (NT network).</p>

<title>Network modularization and analysis</title>
<p>The NT network, representing statistically significant correlations between genes expressed in normal and tumour tissues, was modularized using the community finding algorithm GLay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref013">13</xref>], as implemented in the network analysis tool Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>The algorithm begins by setting each node into a separate community and progressively merges those with the maximum increase to the modularity score. The hierarchical merging tree is cut at the point where maximum modularity is achieved.</p>
<p>Connectivity analysis of the whole network and of the three largest modules (defined as larger than 20 nodes) was performed using the network analysis tool <italic>NetworkAnalizer</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref044">44</xref>], also implemented as a Cytoscape plug-in.</p>

<title>The polarization index</title>

<sec id="sec024">
<title>Computational validation of the polarization index</title>
<p>In order to acquire confidence in the biological relevance of the polarization index we derived a null hypothesis distributions for estimating the likelihood that a given polarization value derives by random chance. This represented a scenario where the overall properties of the data are conserved in the absence of any interaction between normal and tumour samples.</p>
<p>Random data sampled from the Singh <italic>et al</italic>. dataset were used to compute normal and tumour correlation matrices. Each matrix was fitted by a multivariate Gaussian model to generate a synthetic dataset. Synthetic datasets were then used to compute the correlation matrix whose distribution predictively resembles that of the original dataset. Subsequently, the polarization index was estimated from this correlation matrix. The multivariate fitting and subsequent random dataset generation was performed using the function <italic>rmvnorm</italic> within <italic>mvtnorm</italic> packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref045">45</xref>] in the R statistical software environment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Significantly polarized genes have been defined as <italic>pol</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &gt; |0.75|. At this threshold we did not observed any false positives in the 8000 random simulations performed.</p>
<p>Although the expected level of contamination of tumour tissue with normal cells is expected to be very low, we devised a computational strategy to ask whether the polarization index could arise as a result of contamination of tumour samples with normal cells. We computed the polarization index between two simulated datasets that reproduce a situation where both tumour and normal samples are derived from normal tissues with added noise, thereby simulating variation that is consistent with a true microarray experiment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s008">S8A Fig</xref></bold>). Firstly, an adapted model of the type derived by Jain <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref046">46</xref>] was used to estimate the experimental noise across replicates (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s008">S8B Fig</xref></bold>). Random Gaussian noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref047">47</xref>] derived from this noise model was then added to the normal tissue dataset to create a synthetic normal and synthetic contaminated tumour dataset. The intensity of the added noise was controlled by adding a scaling factor γ, which was chosen to match the distribution of correlations between genes in the synthetic datasets with the distribution observed in the real data (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s008">S8C Fig</xref></bold>). The distribution of the polarization coefficient is consistent with the notion that even high levels of contamination cannot explain the observed distribution of polarization coefficient (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s008">S8D Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Co-culture system</title>
<p>Normal (RWPE1) and tumour (DU145) prostate cell lines were co-cultured in a transwell system (transwell I used was from Nunc, Loughborough, UK, Cat. 12-565-286; Pore size, 0.2 μm.) for 24 hours in the presence of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The experiment was performed in triplicate with DU145 alone or DU145 co-cultured with either RWPE1 or DU145 in the insert. Cells from all compartments were harvested and RNA extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, USA). Custom-made oligonucleotide arrays were manufactured using the Operon Human Oligo set, version 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref051">51</xref>] and then hybridized with Cy3 labeled probe, as described in Sarti <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref052">52</xref>]</p>
<p>Phenotypic cell analysis was carried out in Becton Dickinson TC treated 96-well plates. 2.5 x 103 cells were seeded per well in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. 24 hours later, some wells were fitted with inserts also seeded with 2.5 x 103 cells per insert. Two days later inserts were removed, media was aspirated from the wells and cells were fixed with 85% ice-cold ethanol for at least two hours. After fixation cells were stained with propidium iodide (10 μg per ml propidium iodide, 100 μg per ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 100 μl per well). Plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 min in the dark and then analysed by laser scanning cytometry (Acumen Explorer, TTP Labtech.).</p>
<p>The intensity of the propidium iodide fluorescence was proportional to the DNA content of the cells and was measured on a linear scale. Single healthy and apoptotic cells were identified based on nuclear size and DNA content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref053">53</xref>]. Cell clusters were defined as single scanned objects that contained multiple nuclei.

<title>Statistical modelling linking genetic mutations, transcription of polarised genes, tumour features and clinical outcome</title>
<p>In order to address the hypothesis that disease linked genetic mutations such as copy number variation (CNV) may influence the expression of polarised genes in tumour cells and that this, in turn, may be predictive of tumour features and clinical outcome we implemented a data analysis pipeline based on a number of advanced statistical procedures.</p>
<p>We used an independent dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref017">17</xref>], which had comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), gene expression and comprehensive information on tumour features and clinical outcome for a total of 231 tumour samples.</p>
<p>Firstly, in order to prioritise relevant genetic abnormalities we used ANOVA to rank CGH signals linked to tumour features and/or one of the clinical outcome variables (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s022">S1 File</xref></bold> for further details). The top 2017 probes in the ranked list were selected as an input of the modelling procedure.</p>
<p>We then mapped the 391 polarised genes we originally identified on the independent dataset. Next, we used the selected CGH data and the polarised gene expression profiling dataset as an input of a hierarchical Bayesian model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref055">55</xref>] to find association between polarized gene expressions and CNV (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004884.s023">S2 File</xref></bold> for details of the modeling procedure as applied here). Next, we fit an ANCOVA model for each gene expression on the tumour features. We then computed correlations for the significant associations (p&lt;0.05) and integrated all information in a network format using the Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref043">43</xref>] software (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004884.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>). Finally, we selected all polarized genes represented in the network and performed a survival analysis testing the hypothesis that their expression in tumour cells could be linked to clinical outcome (survival and time free of recurrence).</p>
<p>Survival analysis was performed as below. Briefly, for each gene we defined an optimal cutoff to separate patients in two groups of low and high-expressing tumours, using procedure described in Budczies <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004884.ref056">56</xref>]. Using this cut off, we dichotomized each gene expression level that was then used to fit a cox regression model.</p>

<title>Survival analysis.</title>
<p>The table shows the results of the survival analysis on the polarized genes significantly associated with either the Gleason score or CNV. More specifically, for each gene it shows the polarization direction, the estimate of the coefficient of a cox regression model, the corresponding p-value and the corrected p-value after the Benjamini and Hochberg correction. For each gene an optimal cutoff was defined to separate patients in two groups of low and high-expressing tumours. The resulting dichotomized gene expression levels were then used to fit the cox regression model. The rightmost columns show whether the gene is associated with Gleason score, CNV or both. The analysis is performed twice on survival and time of recurrence.</p>
