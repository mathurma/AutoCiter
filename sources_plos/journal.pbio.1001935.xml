<p>The Genomic Landscape of Compensatory Evolution Laboratory selection experiment explains how organisms compensate for the loss of genes during evolution, and reveals the deleterious side-effects of this process when adapting to novel environments.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Adaptive evolution is generally assumed to progress through the accumulation of beneficial mutations. However, as deleterious mutations are common in natural populations, they generate a strong selection pressure to mitigate their detrimental effects through compensatory genetic changes. This process can potentially influence directions of adaptive evolution by enabling evolutionary routes that are otherwise inaccessible. Therefore, the extent to which compensatory mutations shape genomic evolution is of central importance. Here, we studied the capacity of the baker's yeast genome to compensate the complete loss of genes during evolution, and explored the long-term consequences of this process. We initiated laboratory evolutionary experiments with over 180 haploid baker's yeast genotypes, all of which initially displayed slow growth owing to the deletion of a single gene. Compensatory evolution following gene loss was rapid and pervasive: 68% of the genotypes reached near wild-type fitness through accumulation of adaptive mutations elsewhere in the genome. As compensatory mutations have associated fitness costs, genotypes with especially low fitnesses were more likely to be subjects of compensatory evolution. Genomic analysis revealed that as compensatory mutations were generally specific to the functional defect incurred, convergent evolution at the molecular level was extremely rare. Moreover, the majority of the gene expression changes due to gene deletion remained unrestored. Accordingly, compensatory evolution promoted genomic divergence of parallel evolving populations. However, these different evolutionary outcomes are not phenotypically equivalent, as they generated diverse growth phenotypes across environments. Taken together, these results indicate that gene loss initiates adaptive genomic changes that rapidly restores fitness, but this process has substantial pleiotropic effects on cellular physiology and evolvability upon environmental change. Our work also implies that gene content variation across species could be partly due to the action of compensatory evolution rather than the passive loss of genes.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>While core cellular processes are generally conserved during evolution, the constituent genes differ somewhat between related species with similar lifestyles. Why should this be so? In this work, we propose that gene loss may initially be deleterious, but organisms can recover fitness by the accumulation of compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome. To investigate this process in the laboratory, we investigated 180 haploid yeast strains, each of which initially displayed slow growth owing to the deletion of a single gene. Laboratory evolutionary experiments revealed that defects in a broad range of molecular processes can readily be compensated during evolution. Genomic analyses and functional assays demonstrated that compensatory evolution generates hidden genetic and physiological variation across parallel evolving lines, which can be revealed when the environment changes. Strikingly, despite nearly full recovery of fitness, the wild-type genomic expression pattern is generally not restored. Based on these results, we argue that genomes undergo major changes not simply to adapt to external conditions but also to compensate for previously accumulated deleterious mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Deleterious, but non-lethal mutations are constantly generated and can hitchhike with adaptive mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Lang1">[1]</xref>. Consequently, such deleterious alleles are widespread in eukaryotic populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Doniger1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-MacArthur1">[3]</xref>. For example, as high as 12% of the coding SNPs in yeast populations are deleterious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Doniger1">[2]</xref>. Many of the observed functional variation in this species yield proteins with compromised or no activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Doniger1">[2]</xref>, or lead to complete loss of genes with significant contribution to fitness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s018">Text S1</xref>). Deleterious loss-of-function variants may occasionally revert to wild type, eventually perish from the population, or become compensated by mutations elsewhere in the genome. The third possibility, termed compensatory evolution, is the focus of our study. Theoretical works suggest that mutant subpopulations can cross fitness valleys by the simultaneous fixation of a compensatory mutation in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Kimura1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Weinreich1">[5]</xref>. This process can also work in large populations and is facilitated by linkage of the two alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Weinreich1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Compensatory evolution appears to be common at many levels of molecular interactions. It is involved in the maintenance of RNA and protein secondary structures, it mitigates the costs of antibiotic resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Andersson1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Estes1">[7]</xref>, and allows rapid fitness recovery in populations with accumulated deleterious mutation loads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Estes1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Estes2">[9]</xref>. Compensatory regulatory mutations also act to stabilize gene expression levels across species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Goncalves1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Kuo1">[11]</xref>, and conserve DNA-encoded nucleosome organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Kenigsberg1">[12]</xref>. The most detailed experimental analyses on compensatory mutations for fixed deleterious mutations were performed in DNA bacteriophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Burch1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Poon1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Harcombe1">[15]</xref>, bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moore1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Blank1">[17]</xref>, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Estes1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Estes2">[9]</xref>. Three major patterns emerged from these studies. As the target size for compensatory mutations is typically much larger than that for reversion, compensation is more likely than reversion of deleterious mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Poon1">[13]</xref>. The rate of compensatory evolution increased with the severity of the deleterious fitness effects, and was not limited to functionally interacting partners of the mutated gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Harcombe1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>As regards the potential pleiotropic effects of compensatory evolution, our knowledge is rather limited, not least because it demands detailed exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms of compensation. Compensatory mutations may enhance fitness either by reducing the need for the gene with the compromised function, or by restoring the efficiency of the affected molecular function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Andersson2">[18]</xref>. For compensation of fitness costs of antibiotic resistance conferring mutations, restoration of function was the most common mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Andersson2">[18]</xref>, but in other systems the relative importance of functional substitution and restoration is unknown. In the case of functional restoration (e.g., by enhanced dosage of a redundant duplicate of the disrupted gene), one might expect limited pleiotropic fitness effects of compensatory mutations across environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Compensatory evolution following gene loss is of special interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Blank1">[17]</xref>. Gene loss may be initiated by genetic drift and/or selection through antagonistic pleiotropy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Blank1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Qian1">[19]</xref>. As reversion to the wild-type state is less likely, gene loss may promote genetic changes that drive the populations to new adaptive peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It's reasonable to assume that compensatory mutations are generally specific to the gene defect, and multiple molecular mechanisms can restore fitness. Therefore, independently evolving populations carrying an inactivated gene are expected to diverge from each other. Moreover, if compensation mainly proceeds by reducing the need for the disrupted molecular function then compensatory evolution could have a large impact on cellular physiology and survival upon environmental change. Accordingly, the beneficial effects of compensatory mutations may frequently be conditional, and subsequent changes to the environment can reveal the hidden genetic variation across populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The goal of the current study was to test this hypothesis by an integrated systems biology approach. Specifically, we aimed to determine the potential of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome to compensate for gene loss through compensatory evolution and to explore the long-term consequences of this process.</p>

<title>Rapid Compensatory Evolution Following Gene Loss Is Common</title>
<p>We initiated laboratory evolutionary experiments with 187 haploid single gene knock-out mutant strains, all of which initially showed slow (but non-zero) growth compared to the wild-type control in a standard laboratory medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, for selection criteria, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These genes cover a wide range of molecular processes and functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>). Populations were cultivated in parallel (four replicate populations for each null mutation), resulting in 748 independently evolving lines. 0.5% of each culture was diluted into fresh medium every 48 hours, and populations were propagated for approximately 400 generations. To control for potential adaptation unrelated to compensatory evolution, we also established 22 populations starting from the isogenic wild-type genotype, referred to as evolving wild types. Next, all starting and evolved populations were subjected to high-throughput fitness measurements by monitoring growth rates in liquid cultures.</p>

<p>Fitness may increase during the course of laboratory evolution as a result of general adaptation to the environment and/or accumulation of compensatory mutations that suppress the deleterious effects of gene inactivation. Under the assumption that compensatory evolution was the dominant force in our experiments, fitness should not increase by the same extent in all lineages: genotypes that carry deleterious null mutations are further away from the optimal state and are hence expected to show large fitness gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2A</xref>); this was indeed so. On average, the evolving wild-type control populations showed a small, but significant 5% fitness improvement. By contrast, the fitness of populations carrying a deleterious null mutation improved by 23% on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), and many of them approximated wild-type fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>). On the basis of fitness measurements at multiple time points during laboratory evolution (see Methods), we also report that individual fitness trajectories often showed a saturating trend during the course of laboratory evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The difference in fitness improvement is not due to the elevated mutation rate of mutant genotypes for two reasons. First, a previous study conducted a genome-wide screen with the aim to identify genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that influence the rate of mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Huang1">[20]</xref>. While a large number of such genes have been found, only four of them were present in our gene set (<italic>Δrad54</italic>, <italic>Δrad52</italic>, <italic>Δmre11</italic>, and <italic>Δrad50</italic>). Second, fitness improvements of the corresponding single gene knock-out strains did not differ from the rest of the dataset (one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.89).</p>
<p>As previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moore1">[16]</xref>, we defined compensatory evolution as a fitness increase that is disproportionally large relative to that in the evolving wild-type lines. Using this definition, 68% of the genotypes showed evidence of compensatory evolution (i.e., at least one of the four independently evolving populations fulfilled the above criteria). The corresponding genes cover a wide range of molecular and cellular processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Impact of Gene Pleiotropy and Dispensability on the Propensity for Compensation</title>
<p>Next, we compared the fitness improvements between evolved lines founded from the same gene deletion genotype versus those founded from different genotypes. This analysis revealed that not all genes were equally likely to be compensated as fitness gain differed significantly across genotypes (ANOVA, F(186) = 3.9, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−14</sup>) (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s002">Figure S2</xref>). It has been previously suggested that as mutations with especially large fitness effects tend to disrupt a broader range of molecular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Costanzo1">[21]</xref>, such mutations may influence the number of mutational targets where compensatory evolution can occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Poon1">[13]</xref>. We compiled three datasets that estimate different aspects of gene pleiotropy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Wang1">[22]</xref>, including fitness under diverse environmental conditions (environmental pleiotropy), the number of protein-protein interactions (network pleiotropy), and the number of biological processes associated with a gene (multifunctionality). The extent of evolutionary compensation did not depend on any of the above mentioned features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). However, consistent with results of prior small-scale bacterial and viral evolutionary studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Poon1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moore1">[16]</xref>, null mutations with more severe defects were more likely to be compensated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). This pattern probably reflects that the availability of compensatory mutations across the genome strongly depends on the fitness effect of the deleted gene. We provide a simple explanation of this phenomenon in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Compensatory Evolution Promotes Genomic Diversification</title>
<p>To investigate the genomic changes underlying compensatory evolution, we re-sequenced the complete genomes of 41 independently evolved lines and the 14 corresponding ancestors, all of which showed large fitness improvements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>). We focused on <italic>de novo</italic> mutations that accumulated during the course of laboratory evolution. Large-scale duplications (including segmental or whole chromosome duplication) were observed in 22% of the laboratory evolved lines. On average, six point mutations and 0.5 small insertions or deletions per clone were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s007">Table S2</xref>). The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations was significantly higher than expected by chance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), indicating that the accumulation of these mutations was driven by adaptive evolution. On average, pairs of evolutionary lines founded from the same genotype shared 5.3% of their mutated genes, while the same figure was 0.1% for lines founded from different genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s007">Table S2</xref>). This result is in contrast to results of a prior bacterial study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Tenaillon1">[23]</xref>, where a strong signature of parallel evolution emerged at the gene level across parallel evolving laboratory populations. Despite the rarity of parallel evolution at the molecular level, a major unifying trend emerged: evolution preferentially affected genes that are functionally related to that of the disrupted gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, when the null mutation affected a protein complex subunit, another subunit of the same complex was mutated 10 times more often than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that deletion of any single gene drives adaptive genetic changes specific to the functional defect incurred.</p>

<title>Pre-Existing Genetic Redundancy Has No Major Impact on Compensatory Evolution</title>
<p>Although duplicated genes with partially overlapping function are frequent in the yeast genome, we found no evidence that genetic changes affecting a duplicate of the disrupted gene provide a general mechanism of compensation in our evolved lines. First, our dataset contains 128 genes showing evidence for compensation, and only 25% of these genes have a duplicate in the yeast genome (i.e., at least 30% amino acid similarity between the two copies). This figure is a gross overestimate, as it includes very distant duplicates that most likely diverged functionally (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Second, the subset of genes with a gene duplicate were not more likely to be compensated during laboratory evolution than the rest of the dataset (Chi-squared test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.54). Third, genome sequence analysis of the evolved lines revealed only one clear example where evolution proceeded through increasing the dosage of a gene duplicate with redundant function of the deleted gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). All three studied evolved lines of <italic>Δrpl6b</italic> showed an increased copy number of the left arm of Chromosome XIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). <italic>RPL6B</italic> is a non-essential gene and encodes a ribosomal 60S subunit protein L6B. The duplicated genomic regions of <italic>Δrpl6b</italic> evolved lines carry <italic>RPL6A</italic>, a duplicate copy of <italic>RPL6B</italic>. The two genes share 94% amino acid identity, have highly overlapping functions, and deletion of both genes confer a synthetic lethal phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Steffen1">[24]</xref>. On the basis of these observations, we propose that doubling the copy number of <italic>RPL6A</italic> through segmental duplication could be partly responsible for the improved fitness in the evolved lines carrying the <italic>RPL6B</italic> deletion. The hypothesis was tested by increasing the copy number of <italic>RPL6A</italic> in wild-type and Δrpl6b genetic backgrounds, respectively. As expected, an enhanced copy number of <italic>RPL6A</italic> substantially improved the fitness of <italic>Δrpl6b</italic>, but not that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Compensatory Evolution Does Not Restore Wild-Type Genomic Expression State</title>
<p>Compensatory evolution may restore wild-type physiology or generate novel alterations with respect to prior physiological states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Carroll1">[25]</xref>. To investigate the relative contribution of these processes, eight genotypes carrying a deleterious gene deletion and one corresponding evolved line were selected for transcriptome analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for selection criteria). Using DNA microarrays, the global gene expression states were compared between the wild-type, the ancestral line, and the evolved lines carrying the same gene deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). As expected from prior studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Hughes1">[26]</xref>, inactivation of genes with high fitness contribution altered the expression of a large number of genes across the genome (ranging between 81 to 588) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s008">Table S3</xref>). Next, the transcriptomic profiles were compared by calculating all pairwise combinations of Euclidean distances. The wild-type, the ancestral line, and the corresponding evolved lines generally showed substantial differences in their transcriptome profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that compensatory evolution drives the cell towards novel genomic expression states. Importantly, transcriptome profile distances between different genotypes was always higher than distances between replicate measurements of the same genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), implying that the substantial differences observed between evolved lines and wild-type cannot be attributed to measurement noise. As a further support, typically only 10%–30% of the genes with altered expression in the ancestral lines showed significant shift towards the wild-type expression level in the corresponding evolved lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Hence, despite substantial fitness improvements (&gt;75% for all cases investigated), the majority of the gene expression changes due to gene deletion remained unrestored during evolution. These patterns were not attributable to growth rate regulated gene expression or copy number variation in the evolved lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

(B) The Euclidean distances of microarray profiles of the evolved evolutionary line from its ancestor and from wild type (WT) were calculated and normalized to the ancestor–wild type distance for each genotype. The distances of the points in the figure are proportional to the calculated profile distances. For each genotype triplet, distances were calculated on the basis of those genes that are differentially expressed in at least one of the pairwise comparisons. For each deletion strain, the edges of the triangle represent Euclidean distances of log<sub>2</sub> mRNA expression fold-changes between the wild-type (WT), ancestor (anc), and evolved (evo) lines. To calculate these distances we used the average of four replicate expression measurements (two biological and two technical replicates). Circles around average values represent the Euclidean distance between the two biological replicates (calculated as the average based on the two technical replicates).

<title>Compensatory Evolution Generates Diverse Growth Phenotypes across Environments</title>
<p>Taken together, compensatory evolution following gene loss did not restore wild-type genomic expression and promoted genomic divergence across populations. Are these evolutionary outcomes phenotypically completely equivalent? This problem was first addressed by monitoring the fitness of 237 evolved populations in 14 environmental settings, including previously tested nutrients and stress factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Dudley1">[27]</xref>. Prior to evolution, genotypes carrying a gene deletion generally displayed slow growth in most environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>). The situation was far more complex following laboratory evolution. Considering all possible pairs of population-environment combinations, fitness improved in 52%, and declined in 8% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, independently evolved populations carrying the same disrupted gene showed more fitness variation across the 14 tested conditions than in the environment they had been exposed to during laboratory evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>), while evolved wild-type populations did not show such a difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0.93, coefficient of variations compared by Z-test). Furthermore, the degree of fitness variation across conditions was especially high for gene deletions that showed large fitness gains during compensatory evolution (Spearman rho = 0.36, <italic>p</italic> = 10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These results indicate that the level of discernible heterogeneity in fitness was relatively low in the evolved populations founded from the same genotype, but the variation can be uncovered upon environmental change.</p>

<p>Finally, our analysis revealed a few instances where the laboratory evolved lines displayed significantly higher than wild-type fitness in specific environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>).

Moreover, the fitnesses of these lines in this medium surpassed all that of the 22 evolved wild-type controls.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work addresses one of the most long-standing debates in evolution. Since the early 1920s, Ronald Fisher pioneered the view that adaptation is by and large a hill climbing process: it proceeds through progressive accumulation of beneficial mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Fisher1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Orr1">[38]</xref>. However, as slightly deleterious mutations are far more abundant, they have a significant contribution to genetic variation in natural populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Doniger1">[2]</xref>. In the long run, the wealth of such detrimental mutations is expected to promote fixation of compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome. This work focused on a specific aspect of this problem, and asked whether deleterious gene loss events promote adaptive genetic changes and what the side consequences of such a process might be. To systematically study compensatory evolution following gene loss, we initiated laboratory evolutionary experiments with over 180 haploid yeast genotypes, all of which initially displayed slow growth owing to the deletion of a single gene, and investigated the genomic and phenotypic capacities of the evolved lines in detail. Thanks to the exceptionally large-scale analysis of our study, the following major conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>First, compensatory evolution following gene loss was pervasive: 68% of the deleterious, but non-lethal gene disruptions were compensated through the accumulation of adaptive mutations elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, in agreement with prior bacterial studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moore1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Blank1">[17]</xref>, the process was strikingly rapid. As the set of disrupted genes are functionally very diverse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>), it appears that defects in a broad range of molecular processes can readily be compensated during evolution.However, we and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Blank1">[17]</xref> also found that not all genotypes are equally likely to be recovered during laboratory evolution. Therefore, future works should clarify the exact molecular, functional, and systems level gene properties that influence compensability. Second, our large-scale study indicates that the extent of fitness loss due to gene disruption is one if not the strongest predictor of compensatory evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Although this relationship has been observed previously in small-scale studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moore1">[16]</xref>, the reasons remained largely unknown. One may argue that the spread of compensatory mutations with mild beneficial effects would have taken many more than 400 generations to reach fixation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moore1">[16]</xref>. Although this explanation cannot be excluded, there is another intriguing possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Poon1">[13]</xref>. Consistent with Fisher's geometric model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Fisher1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Orr1">[38]</xref>, fitness improvement in populations close to an optimal state can only be achieved by relatively rare mutations with small effects. However, when a population with a gene defect is further away from a fitness peak, compensatory evolution may proceed through a wider range of mutations, including ones that have deleterious side effects. Two lines of evidence are consistent with this scenario. Compensatory evolution has associated pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g006">6C</xref>). Moreover, the theory predicts that compensatory mutations should be especially frequent in the case of strongly deleterious null mutations. An analysis based on data of a prior genome-wide genetic interaction study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Costanzo1">[21]</xref> suggests that it may indeed be so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Strongly deleterious gene deletions can be suppressed by a large number of other null mutations according to a genome-wide genetic interaction study.</title>
<p>The plot shows the relationship between the fitness of a given single-gene deletion strain and the fraction of other genes across the genome whose deletion suppresses the fitness effect of this mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s014">Table S9</xref>). Boxplots present the median and first and third quartiles, with whiskers showing either the maximum (minimum) value or 1.5 times the interquartile range of the data. Spearman correlation on raw data: rho = −0.69, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 3880. We note that using the fraction of suppressive interactions among all genetic interactions displayed by a given gene yields a very similar result (rho = −0.69, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>), indicating that the relationship is not simply due to the fact that slow-growing strains generally display especially large numbers of both positive and negative interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Costanzo1">[21]</xref>. Information on suppression genetic interactions and single-deletion fitness comes from a global genetic interaction map of yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Costanzo1">[21]</xref>. Suppression interactions were defined as in previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Baryshnikova2">[70]</xref>. In brief, deletion of gene <italic>B</italic> suppresses deletion of gene <italic>A</italic> if their fitness values obey the following rules: <italic>F<sub>A</sub></italic>&lt;<italic>F<sub>B</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>AB</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>F<sub>A</sub></italic>+<italic>σ<sub>A</sub></italic> (where <italic>F<sub>A</sub></italic>, <italic>F<sub>B</sub></italic>, and <italic>F<sub>AB</sub></italic> are the fitness measures of single deletants <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, and the double deletant <italic>AB</italic>, respectively, and <italic>σ<sub>A</sub></italic> is the standard deviation of <italic>F<sub>A</sub></italic>). One important caveat is that as this simple analysis considers null mutations only, the results should be considered preliminary.</p>

<p>Third, genomic analysis of the evolved lines revealed that deletion of any single gene drives adaptive genetic changes specific to the functional defect incurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and consequently convergent evolution at the molecular level was extremely rare. In agreement with a prior bacterial evolutionary study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Blank1">[17]</xref>, we found that gene duplication has only a minor role during compensatory evolution following gene loss. A more general issue is the extent to which mutations that affect gene expression could alone recover fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Blank1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Magtanong1">[39]</xref>. Although genetic changes in putative promoter regions were not overrepresented in our dataset (Binomial test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.87), 21 observed point mutations generated in-frame stop codons, most likely yielding proteins with compromised or no activities (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These results indicate that fitness recovery following gene loss can partly be achieved purely through inactivation of other genes.</p>
<p>Fourth, compensatory evolution promoted divergence of genomic diversification, and shifted the evolved population towards novel genomic expression states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Despite substantial fitness improvements, the majority of the gene expression changes due to gene deletion remained unrestored during evolution. This finding is consistent with prior works arguing that no clear relationship exists between the change in mRNA expression of a gene and its requirement for growth in the same condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Giaever1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fifth, independently evolved populations showed substantial fitness variation across environments that they had not been exposed to during laboratory evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001935-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that accumulation of adaptive mutations during compensatory evolution generated substantial genetic differences between populations, and this variation can be uncovered upon environmental change.</p>
<p>Taken together, several lines of evidence indicate that fitness gains in the evolved lines reflect accumulation of gene specific compensatory mutations rather than a global adaptation: (i) evolving wild-type control populations showed only minor changes in fitness, (ii) the rate of adaptation was genotype specific, (ii) convergence at the molecular across genotypes was extremely rare, (iv) evolution preferentially affected genes that are functionally related to that of the disrupted gene, and (v) compensatory mutations had no beneficial impact in a wild-type genetic background.</p>
<p>The above results encouraged us to distinguish between two evolutionary scenarios. Organisms may attempt to restore the disrupted molecular function through mutations in genes with redundant functions (functional restoration). Alternatively, they may aim to minimize the cellular damage incurred by gene disruption (functional replacement). While the possibility of full functional restoration cannot be excluded, the rarity of compensation through mutations in gene duplicates and the plasticity of compensatory mutational effects across environments are consistent with the second scenario. Indeed, our work demonstrates that gene loss promotes genetic changes that have a large impact on evolutionary diversification, genomic expression, and viability upon environmental change. An important implication of our study is that the beneficial effects of compensatory mutations should frequently be conditional, and subsequent changes to the environment can reveal the hidden fitness effects (beneficial and detrimental alike). Lack of restoration of fitness across environments is broadly consistent with the emerging view that epistatic interactions are plastic across conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Harrison1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Bandyopadhyay1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>The perspective offered in this work leads to the re-formulation of several fundamental questions. First, it sheds light on an evolutionary paradox: while core cellular processes are generally conserved during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Kirschner1">[43]</xref>, the constituent genes are partly different across related species with similar lifestyles. We propose that gene content variation across species is partly due to the action of compensatory evolution and may not need to reflect changes in environmental conditions and the consequent passive loss of genes. Although the exact population genetic conditions facilitating this process remain to be elucidated, several observations are consistent with this view. Most notably, the phylogenetic conservation of indispensable genes depends on how easily the gene can be functionally replaced through enhanced expression of other genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Bergmiller1">[44]</xref>. Second, it has been suggested that deleterious mutations may act as stepping stones in adaptive evolution by providing access to fitness peaks that are not otherwise accessible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Covert1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Lenski1">[46]</xref>. Indeed, our analysis revealed a few instances where the laboratory evolved lines displayed significantly higher than wild-type fitness in specific environments. Finally, given the prevalence of gene loss events during tumorigenesis, future work should elucidate whether similar processes drive the somatic evolution of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Iwasa1">[47]</xref>.</p>

<title>Yeast Strains and Media</title>
<p>All strains used in this study were derived from the BY4741 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> parental strain. Non-essential single-gene deletion strains from the haploid yeast deletion collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Giaever1">[40]</xref> (MATa; his3Δ 1; leu2Δ 0; met15Δ 0; ura3Δ 0; xxx::KanMX4) were used to systematically identify all gene disruptions with a significant growth defect. Slow-growing mutants were identified in two steps. An earlier study identified 671 gene deletants in diploid background, which showed a significant fitness defect on both rich and synthetic media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Deutschbauer1">[48]</xref>. We thus measured fitness of the corresponding MATa haploid strains by recording their growth curves in liquid media. We identified 187 deletants showing at least 10% growth rate defect, which constituted the set of ancestral strains subjected to laboratory evolution (for details of growth measurements see below).</p>
<p>The slow-growing yeast deletants used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>.

<title>Laboratory Evolution</title>
<p>Compensatory adaptation refers to fitness gains in a gene deletion strain that are greater than fitness gains occurring in an isogenic wild-type strain. We conducted a series of laboratory evolutionary experiments using four independent populations of each of the 187 slow-growing deletants along with 22 independent lineages of an isogenic wild-type strain (referred to as <italic>evolving</italic> wild types). The <italic>YOR202W</italic> deletion strain was used as evolving wild-type control because the fitness of this strain is indistinguishable from the BY4741 parental wild-type strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Qian1">[19]</xref>. Moreover, this strain carries the KanMX4 cassette in the nonfunctional <italic>his3</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic> allele, thus it was possible to control for the reported mutation-generating effect of the KanMX4 cassette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Teng1">[36]</xref>. All strains were inoculated into randomly selected positions of 96-well plates. Four wells in different positions were not inoculated by cells to help plate identification and orientation. Cells were grown in standard laboratory rich media to minimize selection pressure originating from nutrient limitation. The presence of the KanXM4 cassette was not selected for during the evolutionary experiment, since G418 was omitted from the medium for two reasons. First, using G418 at 200 mg/l concentration decreases the growth rate of the unevolved wild-type control strain (unpublished data) and might lead to selection for increased resistance. Second, the usage of the drug at a growth-limiting concentration may induce mutagenesis through environmental stress response. To provide optimal growth conditions, plates were covered with sandwich cover (Enzyscreeen BV), shaken at 350 rpm, and incubated at 30°C. Using a handheld replicator, ∼10<sup>5</sup> cells (∼0.5 µl sample volume) were transferred every second day to 100 µl of fresh medium in 96-well plates resulting in ∼7.6 generations between transfers. The experiment was run for 104 days (∼400 generations total) and samples from days 0, 26, 52, 78, and 104 were frozen in 15% glycerol and kept at −80°C until fitness measurement. Cross-contamination events were regularly checked by PCR and visual inspection of empty wells (unpublished data).</p>

<title>High-Throughput Fitness Measurements</title>
<p>We used established protocols specifically designed to measure fitness in yeast populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Warringer1">[49]</xref>. Growth was assayed by monitoring the optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of liquid cultures of each strain using 384-well microtiter plates containing YPD medium (as during the evolutionary experiments). We used relative growth rate as a proxy for relative fitness (see below). Compared to laborious competition based fitness assays, this protocol allows estimating growth rate on a relatively large scale in an environment that is nearly identical to the one used in the evolutionary experiments.</p>

<title>Growth Curve Recording</title>
<p>Starter cultures were inoculated from frozen samples using 96-well plates. The starter plates were grown for 48 hours under identical conditions to the evolutionary experiment. 384-well plates filled with 60 µl rich medium per well were inoculated for growth curve recording from the starter plates using pintool with 1.58 mm floating pins. The pintool was moved by a Microlab Starlet liquid handling workstation (Hamilton Bonaduz AG) to provide uniform inoculum across all samples. The median blank corrected initial OD<sub>600</sub> of the wells was 0.027. Each 384-well plate were inoculated with four different starter plates: one plate having the unevolved wild-type control as a reference strain in all wells in order to estimate various within-plate measurement biases, and three plates containing the same set of mutants from three of the five time points of the evolutionary experiment. The 384-well plates were incubated at 30°C in an STX44 (LiCONiC AG) automated incubator with alternating shaking speed every minute between 1,000 rpm and 1,200 rpm. Plates were transferred by a Microlab Swap 420 robotic arm (Hamilton Bonaduz AG) to Powerwave XS2 plate readers (BioTek Instruments Inc) every 20 minutes and cell growth was followed by recording the optical density at 600 nm. Six technical replicate measurements were executed on all strains sampled from each time-point of the evolutionary experiment. Measurements with growth curve irregularities were automatically removed. Only those strains were further analyzed where at least four technical replicate measurements remained after this quality control step.</p>

<title>Growth Curve Analysis</title>
<p>Growth rate was calculated from the obtained growth curves following an established procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Warringer1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Warringer2">[50]</xref>. To eliminate potential within-plate effects that might cause measurement bias, growth rates were normalized by the growth rate of neighboring reference wells that contained the wild-type controls. For each strain and each evolutionary time point, relative fitness was calculated as the median of the normalized growth rates of the technical replicates divided by the median growth rate of the wild-type controls. At day 0, the technical replicate measurements of the isogenic independently evolving lines were combined to calculate median ancestral fitness since by that time these populations had no independent evolutionary history. Stringent criteria were used to define the set of ancestor strains with substantial growth rate defect: a minimum of 10% fitness drop was required compared to the wild-type controls; significance was determined by one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>p</italic>-value was corrected with a false discovery rate of 0.05.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4f">
<title>Identifying Lines Showing a Significant Compensatory Adaptation</title>
<p>To determine whether the fitness defect of a given knock-out strain became compensated during the evolutionary experiment two criteria must have been met: First, the growth rate improvement had to be significant (one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>p</italic>-value corrected with a false discovery rate of 0.05). Second, the growth rate increment of the knock-out strain had to be disproportionally larger than that of the evolving wild-type control strains. To test whether fitness gain in a knockout is higher than those occurring in the evolving control lines, we first fitted a normal distribution to the fitness improvement values of the evolving control lines. Next, we defined a fitness improvement cutoff, so that the probability that an evolving control line would show an improvement at least that high is less than 0.05.</p>
<p>To evaluate the extent of evolutionary compensation, a relative compensation index was calculated according to the following formula:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001935.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001935.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where WT and Δ means median normalized growth rate of the evolving wild-type control and the knock-out strain, respectively, measured before (start) and after (end) the evolutionary experiment. Thus, a relative compensation of 1 indicates that the knock-out strain reached the same fitness after evolution as the evolving wild-type control strains.

<title>Phenotypic Profiling across Environmental Conditions</title>
<p>To study the pleiotropic effects of compensatory adaptation, we measured the fitnesses of 237 evolved lines carrying a single gene deletion, all evolved wild-type control lines along with the corresponding ancestors across various environmental conditions. As this experiment demands high-throughput analyses (over 14,000 data points), fitness was estimated by colony size on solid agar media. Moreover, it allowed direct comparison of the reliability of our measurements to results of a previous study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>We prepared solid agar media of 14 different compositions to expose the strains to fundamentally diverse environments and to obtain sufficient throughput. Our list of 14 growth media was primarily based on a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Dudley1">[27]</xref> and included various carbon sources and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s009">Table S4</xref>). A robotized replicating system was set up for colony size based fitness measurement. The system consists of a Microlab Starlet liquid handling workstation (Hamilton Bonaduz AG) equipped with a pintool with 768 pins (S&amp;P Robotics Inc) and a custom-made pintool sterilization station. Several aspects of the replication procedure had been experimentally customized to achieve uniform, reproducible inoculation of yeast cells.</p>
<p>Fitness of the ancestor (day 0) and evolved strains (day 104) was approximated by measuring colony sizes of ordered arrays of strains at 768 density. First, four different 96-well plates of the evolutionary experiment were scaled up to arrays of 384 colonies: one having the unevolved wild-type control in all positions, and three different plates of the mutant set from the same time point. Then pairs of 384 arrays with corresponding strains from day 0 and 104 were combined to reach 768 density. With this set up, all evolving replicate lines derived from the same ancestral genotype from both day 0 and day 104 were grown on the same 768 plate to exclude potential plate-to-plate variations when comparing colony growth of ancestor and evolved lines. Four technical replicates of these 768 arrays were transferred into each of the 14 different media.</p>
<p>After acclimatization to the media at 30°C for 48 hours the plates were replicated again onto the same type of media and photographed after 48 hours of incubation at 30°C. Digital images were processed to calculate colony sizes, and potential systematic biases in colony growth were eliminated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s018">Text S1</xref>). For each growth environment, fitness of each original knock-out genotype at day zero and each independently evolving line at day 104 was determined as the median of the size of replicate colonies. The reliability of our experimental setup and data processing was confirmed by comparing the fitness measurements of ancestral knock-out strains with the published data of Dudley and colleagues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s005">Figure S5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Dudley1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>To determine whether an ancestor genotype shows a significantly altered fitness compared to the wild-type control in a given environment, we used a Wilcoxon rank sum test (with <italic>p</italic>-value corrected for each condition with a false discovery rate of 0.05). The same statistical test was used to determine whether the fitness of an evolved line is different from that of its ancestor in a given environment.

<title>Genome Sequencing</title>
<p>To reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of compensation, we subjected 41 strains to whole-genome re-sequencing. Our list of sequenced strains primarily included genotypes with large initial fitness defect, substantial fitness improvement and gradual fitness increase over the course of evolution. To be able to detect parallel evolution at the molecular level, we selected two to four independently evolving lines of each ancestor genotype for sequencing. Overall, 41 evolved lines from 14 deletion strains were chosen along with their corresponding ancestor strains. Candidates were re-streaked and single clones were isolated and their fitness increase was confirmed by growth curve recording.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA was prepared using a glass bead lysis protocol: clones were inoculated into 5 ml YPD+G418 (200 mg/l) and grown to saturation at 30°C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 500 µl of lyis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris [pH 8]). Cells were mechanically disrupted by vortexing for 3 minutes at high speed with 500 µl glass bead (500 µm, acid washed). After adding 275 µl 7 M ammonium acetate, samples were incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes, followed by a second incubation on ice for 5 minutes. The samples were extracted with chloroform∶isoamyl alcohol (24∶1) and centrifuged for 10 minutes. The aqueous layer was transferred into a new tube and precipitated with 1 ml isopropanol, pelleted and washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 500 µl RNaseA solution (50 ng/ml). After 30 minutes RNaseA treatment at room temperature, samples were chloroform∶isoamyl alcohol (24∶1) extracted, precipitated with 50 µl sodium acetate (3 M [pH 5.2]) and 1,250 µl ethanol, pelleted and washed with 70% ethanol. Finally, the genomic DNA was dissolved in water. The steps of re-sequencing was done by the UD-GenoMed Medical Genomic Technologies Ltd: amplified genomic shotgun libraries were run on the Illumina HighScan SC with 1×100 bp single read module resulting in an average coverage of about 80×. Reads were aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> EF4 genome assembly using the BWA software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Li1">[51]</xref> having the genomic repeats masked using RepeatMasking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Kohany1">[52]</xref>.

Genomic single-nucleotide polymorphisms with less than 200 phred-scaled quality score or lower than 0.3 mutant/reference ratio were ignored. Duplications of large chromosomal segments or whole chromosomes were identified as increased read coverage of certain regions. Elevated read coverage of regions with a minimum of 25 kb length were accepted as duplications if both the Control-FREEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Boeva1">[54]</xref> (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and the CNV-seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Xie1">[55]</xref> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) software predicted significant alteration from the read coverage of the reference genome.</p>
<p>Our primary aim was to analyze <italic>de novo</italic> mutational events. <italic>De novo</italic> mutations were identified as alterations from the reference genome specifically found in the evolved lines but not present in the ancestral strains. Mutations, which occurred before our evolutionary experiment but after the gene knock-out, are referred to as secondary ancestor mutations. These mutations were identified in the ancestral strains as SNPs and indels present only in the corresponding ancestor strain, not in any other ancestral strains. The rationale behind this consideration is not to classify mutations accumulated in the parental strain of the mutant library prior to the generation of the knock-out strain as a secondary ancestor mutation.

<title>Datasets Used for Bioinformatic Analysis</title>
<p>To test whether the extent of evolutionary compensation is influenced by the disrupted gene's pleiotropy, we used three complementary measures of gene pleiotropy. Environmental pleiotropy of a non-essential gene was defined as the number of unique conditions in which the removal of the gene resulted in a fitness defect according to Dudley and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Dudley1">[27]</xref>. Network pleiotropy was measured as the total number of protein-protein interactions reported in the BioGRID database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Stark1">[57]</xref>.

<p>To investigate whether mutations accumulated during compensatory evolution preferentially affected genes that are functionally related to the disrupted gene, we used different measures of functional relatedness: co-membership within stable protein complexes, shared functional category, genetic interaction profile similarity, co-expression, and paralogy. For protein complexes we used the manually curated dataset based on tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry studies (YHTP2008) from the Wodak lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Pu1">[59]</xref>. For functional categories, the MIPS Functional Catalogue Database was downloaded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Ruepp1">[60]</xref>. Genetic interaction profile similarities were obtained from a large-scale genetic interaction screen study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Costanzo1">[21]</xref>. The authors calculated the genetic interaction profile for a given gene deletion genotype as the list of genetic interaction scores detected across all other genes in their dataset. The genetic interaction profile similarity between two genes was defined as the Pearson correlation value of the two genetic interaction profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Costanzo1">[21]</xref>. For calculating co-expression data, 247 normalized microarray datasets from the M3D database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Faith1">[61]</xref> were used to create an expression profile for each gene. In case of multiple replicates per experiment, the average normalized values were calculated, and employed further.

<p>Paralog gene pairs were identified by performing all-against-all BLASTP similarity searches of yeast open reading frames.

The saturated populations were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.15 in 60 ml YPD and grown to early mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.6±0.05) in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 220 rpm shaking at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 3 min, 30°C) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after removal of supernatant. Total RNA was prepared by hot acidic phenol extraction and cleaned up using the QIAGEN's RNAeasy kit.</p>
<p>All steps after RNA isolation were automated using robotic liquid handlers as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-vanWageningen1">[62]</xref>. Dual-channel 70-mer oligonucleotide arrays were used with a common reference pool of wild-type RNA. Quality control, normalization, and dye-bias correction was performed as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-vanWageningen1">[62]</xref>. The reported fold change is the average of the four replicate mutant profiles versus the average of all wild-type controls. A total of 58 transcripts showed stochastic changes in wild-type profiles and were excluded from the analyses. Differentially expressed genes were defined as those showing a 1.7-fold abundance change and a <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.05 when comparing two strains.

<title>Robustness of Results of the Transcriptome Analysis to Growth Rate Related Genes and Copy Number Variations</title>
<p>All transcriptome comparisons of the wild-type, knockout, and evolved strains were repeated on a dataset where CNVs, genes showing expression response to aneuploidy, and growth rate related genes were excluded. CNVs were identified on the basis of the read coverage of the genome sequence data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s007">Table S2</xref>) with the exception of one strain (Δ<italic>rpl43a</italic>), which was not sequenced.

<title>Strain Modifications to Investigate the Fitness Costs and Epistatic Effects of Compensatory Mutations</title>
<p>The evolved lines of Δ<italic>mdm34</italic> were chosen for in-depth genetic analysis. The fitness cost of the set of compensatory mutations accumulated in the evolved Δ<italic>mdm34</italic> lineages was measured in wild-type genetic background. To this end, the <italic>MDM34</italic> gene was re-introduced into the ancestor and evolved Δ<italic>mdm34</italic> lineages according to the <italic>delitto perfetto</italic> method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moqtaderi1">[67]</xref>. First, the KanMX4 cassette in the ancestor and evolved Δ<italic>mdm34</italic> lineages was swapped with the CORE-UH cassette, containing the <italic>KlURA3</italic> and <italic>hyg</italic> markers. Then the <italic>MDM34</italic> open reading frame with longer than 0.3 kb flanking regions on both sides was amplified from the unevolved wild-type control strain and transformed into the cells to replace the CORE-UH cassette. The replacement of the <italic>KlURA3</italic> marker was counter-selected using 5-FOA containing medium. The loss of hyg<sup>r</sup> was confirmed, the site and orientation of gene replacement was verified by PCR and the sequence of the <italic>MDM34</italic> gene was determined by capillary sequencing.</p>
<p>In a second analysis, a point mutation identified in the <italic>MGA2</italic> gene in one of the evolved Δ<italic>mdm34</italic> lineages was reinserted into both the wild-type and ancestor Δ<italic>mdm34</italic> background. This specific point mutation changes the 750th codon of <italic>MGA2</italic> from GAT to TAT resulting in the incorporation of tyrosine instead of aspartic acid. We refer to the mutant allele as <italic>mga2-1</italic>. Using the <italic>delitto perfetto</italic> method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Moqtaderi1">[67]</xref>, we introduced this point mutation into the unevolved wild-type control strain. First, the CORE-UH cassette was inserted into the genome at the desired position of the SNP. Then, two complementary oligonucleotides of 81 bp length with the sequence of the region of interest and the SNP in the 41st position were transformed. The replacement of the <italic>KlURA3</italic> marker with the missense SNP was counter-selected using 5-FOA containing medium, loss of hyg<sup>r</sup> was confirmed, and the result of the site-directed mutagenesis was verified by capillary sequencing. Attempts to introduce the <italic>mga2-1</italic> mutation into the ancestor Δ<italic>mdm34</italic> strain in this way were not successful, presumably due to the severe slow growth of the intermediate strain that lacks both <italic>MDM34</italic> and <italic>MGA2</italic> gene in a functional form. To complement this, a helper plasmid with <italic>MDM34</italic> gene (MoBY ORF Library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Ho1">[68]</xref>) was transformed into the cells prior to the site directed mutagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001935-Gietz1">[69]</xref>. Because of the presence of the <italic>URA3</italic> marker on the helper plasmid, the CORE-Hp53 cassette was used in this experiment. The steps of mutagenesis were similar as without the helper plasmid, which was removed by passaging cells through 5-FOA afterwards.</p>

<title>qPCR Method</title>
<p>Yeast samples were grown in 20 ml YPD medium to mid-log phase (0.8 OD600 value). RNA was extracted from 10<sup>7</sup> yeast cells by acidic phenol method using TRI Reagent Protocol (Sigma-Aldrich Co). The RNA samples were concentrated by the NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 500 ng RNA was used as a template to prepare cDNA using the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). Reactions without template were set up to detect contaminations of the reagents used in the cDNA synthesis. qPCR reactions were set up in 20 µl volume, using the following templates: no template control, 10 ng non-transcribed RNA and cDNA transcribed from 10 ng RNA. The qPCR reactions were run in a Bioer LineK Gene device, using 2× Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific). All samples had three technical replicates. Gene expression was determined in arbitrary units using a standard curve fitted on triplicates of a four-step 10-fold dilution series. <italic>OLE1</italic> expression level was determined relative to <italic>TUB1</italic> expression level as an internal control. All control reactions, not treated with reverse transcriptase or not having template, gave Ct values at least 10 cycles higher than the corresponding samples.</p>

<p><bold>The extent of compensatory evolution in knock-outs is genotype-specific.</bold> Here, we tested whether there are inherent differences in the propensity for compensation across genotypes (i.e., lines carrying different gene deletions). We defined compensatory evolution as a fitness increase that is disproportionally large relative to that in the evolving wild-type lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001935.s006">Table S1</xref>). Accordingly, genotypes can be classified into three major categories on the basis of the fraction of corresponding lines fulfilling the above criteria (none, mixed, all). To assess the degree of departure from random expectation a randomization protocol was used. It generated a distribution of the above three categories under the assumption that all genotypes are equally likely to gain high fitness during the course of laboratory evolution. Specifically, the matrix of lines was shuffled one thousand times (gray bars) and the above categories were recalculated. The analysis revealed a strong enrichment of genotypes where all lines were compensated (“all”) and genotypes where none of the lines were compensated (“none”), while the “mixed” category was relatively rare (a). This result is not simply due to the fact that null mutations with more severe defects are especially likely to be compensated for. When only genotypes with similar initial fitness defects were considered, the trend remained (b,c,d). The four plots show the observed and randomly expected distributions a, for the whole dataset; b, c, d, for initial fitness ranges &lt;0.7, 0.7–0.8, &gt;0.8, respectively. Genotypes where either all or none of the evolutionary lines showed compensation are significantly enriched in all four cases, the corresponding Chi-square test <italic>p</italic>-values for a, b, c, and d are &lt;10<sup>−20</sup>, 0.013, 7×10<sup>−6</sup> and 10<sup>−8</sup>, respectively.</p>
