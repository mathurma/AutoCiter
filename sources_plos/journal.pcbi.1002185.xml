        <p>Recent data shows that HIV-1 is characterised by variation in viral virulence factors that is heritable between infections, which suggests that viral virulence can be naturally selected at the population level. A trade-off between transmissibility and duration of infection appears to favour viruses of intermediate virulence. We developed a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of putative viral genotypes that differ in their virulence. As a proxy for virulence, we use set-point viral load (SPVL), which is the steady density of viral particles in blood during asymptomatic infection. Mutation, the dependency of survival and transmissibility on SPVL, and host effects were incorporated into the model. The model was fitted to data to estimate unknown parameters, and was found to fit existing data well. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters produced a model in which SPVL converged from any initial conditions to observed values within 100–150 years of first emergence of HIV-1. We estimated the 1) host effect and 2) the extent to which the viral virulence genotype mutates from one infection to the next, and found a trade-off between these two parameters in explaining the variation in SPVL. The model confirms that evolution of virulence towards intermediate levels is sufficiently rapid for it to have happened in the early stages of the HIV epidemic, and confirms that existing viral loads are nearly optimal given the assumed constraints on evolution. The model provides a useful framework under which to examine the future evolution of HIV-1 virulence.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Recent studies have suggested that virulence in HIV-1 is partly a characteristic of the virus which is carried from one infection to the next. An infection with intermediate virulence will produce more transmissions during the infectious lifetime because it optimises the trade-off between rate of transmission and duration of infection. Natural selection acts on the heritable variation to increase the relative prevalence of strains with intermediate virulence. In this study we model the evolution of virulence in the viral population as these more successful strains are preferentially transmitted. We fit this model to data from transmitting couples, and find that the model fits the data well. We use this fit to estimate the contribution of the host and the virus to virulence, which complements recent estimates of the heritability of virulence. We also estimate the rate at which the viral determinants of virulence evolve between infections, and this provides predictions for how rapidly the virulence of HIV-1 evolves in a population. We suggest that natural selection on transmissibility results in substantial evolution of virulence in the population. This is sufficiently rapid for virulence to have reached current levels over the available timescale of the human epidemic.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The median time between HIV-1 seroconversion and progression to symptomatic Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is approximately 10 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Babiker1">[1]</xref>. However, there is considerable variation in this rate of progression, with substantial proportions of infected individuals progressing to AIDS in less than 5 years, or remaining AIDS-free after 20 years. Explaining this variability is an important goal of HIV pathogenesis research. Many cofactors which influence time to AIDS have been identified e.g. host genetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gao1">[2]</xref>, host age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Babiker1">[1]</xref>, and recently viral factors have been implicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Alizon1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-vanderKuyl1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper we explore the extent to which viral factors which influence virulence, changing from one infected individual to the next, may have evolved under natural selection in the early phase of HIV-1's history. Between-host selection, leading to changes in the virulence of HIV-1, has potential major implications for the number of human life years affected.</p>
      <p>Virulence is often defined as the excess mortality of the host which occurs as a result of infection with a pathogen. In the case of HIV the excess mortality is nearly 100%, so virulence can be better defined by the reciprocal of the time from infection to death, or time to AIDS. However, since this can only be defined at the host's death, we use set-point viral load (SPVL) as a proxy for virulence. This refers to the relatively stable density of virions in the blood which characterises asymptomatic infection. There is considerable population level variation in SPVL, in spite of its relative stability within the individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Henrard1">[11]</xref>. SPVL is widely used as a prognostic indicator for AIDS, as individuals with a higher SPVL have a higher rate of CD4+ cell decline, and they tend to progress more rapidly to AIDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-deWolf1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Korenromp1">[13]</xref> and die sooner as a consequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mellors1">[14]</xref>. As a result of its relative constancy during asymptomatic infection, SPVL can be measured at a wide range of time points in an individual's infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Geskus1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A simple conceptual model of how SPVL may evolve by between-host natural selection (i.e. selection for the more transmissible genotypes) requires consideration of the transmission potential of individuals of different SPVL. The transmission potential, defined as the product of duration of infection and infection rate, increases with either component of this product. A positive correlation between SPVL and transmission rate has been convincingly demonstrated within heterosexual couples with initially discordant serostatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Quinn1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Fideli1">[18]</xref>. Since there is also a negative correlation between SPVL and duration of asymptomatic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-deWolf1">[12]</xref>, there is therefore a trade-off between duration of and transmission rate during asymptomatic infection. Previous work has quantified this trade-off to suggest that SPVL most commonly observed in infections maximise the transmission potential, suggesting that the distribution of SPVL was shaped by natural selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Fraser1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Natural selection requires that a trait has heritability from one generation to the next, in addition to variation and differential reproductive success. A number of recent studies have identified and quantified this heritable component of SPVL variation which is maintained from one infection to the next <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Alizon1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Hecht1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Hollingsworth1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Tang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-vanderKuyl1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent studies from the Netherlands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gras1">[20]</xref> and Italy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller1">[21]</xref> have found that the mean log<sub>10</sub> SPVL has increased over the recorded history of an HIV-infected cohort, and the rate of CD4+ cell decline has increased. However different transmission groups have demonstrated different patterns of evolution of SPVL. In the initial stages of the epidemic (mid 1980s) injecting drug users showed slower CD4+ declines than heterosexuals or men having sex with men, but this difference decreased over the subsequent decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller1">[21]</xref>. A study with similar methodology in Switzerland found stable virulence over the same time period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller2">[22]</xref>. This suggests that such trends may be area- and risk-group specific. In two studies showing an increase, the levels of SPVL in the earlier time points are lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gras1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller1">[21]</xref> than those which are optimal for transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Fraser1">[19]</xref>. Various studies of the rate of CD4+ decline also suggest an increasing virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-CrumCianflone1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Dorrucci1">[24]</xref>. A study of the <italic>in vitro</italic> replicative fitness of viruses sampled at different time points reported a decrease in replicative fitness over the course of the epidemic in Amsterdam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Arien1">[25]</xref> although a subsequent study of the same city which controlled for time of seroconversion found an increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gali1">[26]</xref>. Overall, observational results on changing virulence are inconclusive, though they suggest either an equilibrium or a slow increase in that direction.</p>
      <p>The lack of evidence for consistent population level trends in SPVL evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller2">[22]</xref> suggests a) the global distribution of SPVL has stabilised at an equilibrium level; b) the rate of evolution is very slow or c) the distribution of SPVL is determined by factors which do not evolve. However, we think c) unlikely, first due to the observations on the heritability of SPVL described above, and second because there is evidence for evolution of SPVL occurring in particular areas or risk groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gras1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To address the expected dynamics of SPVL evolution, we developed and analysed a deterministic mathematical model of between-host transmission and evolution incorporating known parameters linking SPVL to the duration of infection and the rate of transmission. The broad aim was to investigate the hypothesis that viral genotypes of intermediate virulence are naturally selected by transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Fraser1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The primary of aim of this study was to use the observed distribution of SPVL to estimate the quantities of unknown host and viral factors which affect the process of between-host evolution. Comparing the model to data allowed us to calculate the likelihood of the unknown parameters.</p>
      <p>The secondary aim was to assess whether the model, under these parameter estimates, allows convergence of the SPVL distribution towards an intermediate level, or at least to slowly changing levels consistent with observational studies, regardless of the virulence of the founding strain, and whether this can occur within a plausible timescale. The estimated time of origin of HIV-1 is before the most recent common ancestor, which has been dated to 1908 with 95% confidence interval 1884–1924 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Worobey1">[27]</xref>. If evolution has occurred between the founding strain and current infections then it has occurred over a period of ∼100 years.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We modelled the dynamics of putative genotypes of HIV-1 which differ from one another in their mean log<sub>10</sub> SPVL. SPVL was assumed to vary as a result of both host and virus factors. These genotypes differ in their reproductive success as a result of the dependency of duration of asymptomatic infection and transmission rate on SPVL. Their prevalences change over time through competition for susceptible individuals in a constant population.</p>
      <p>The model is formulated as a standard HIV epidemic model in which different viral strains or genotypes compete. Virulence is considered as a one-dimensional trait, with each genotype represented by a point on the one-dimensional spectrum of increasing virulence. When a person is infected by a virus of a given genotype, the infection is characterised by a SPVL which reflects the virulence, but also other non-viral factors. When transmitted, the virus can also mutate to higher or lower levels of virulence.</p>
      <p>The model encodes the natural history of infection. After infection, individuals experience a brief period of highly infectious acute stage, after which they progress to chronic asymptomatic infection. Their SPVL determines both the duration and infectiousness of this asymptomatic stage, after which their viral load and infectiousness increases again as they progress to AIDS and death. Individuals are assumed to engage in serially monogamous partnerships; a realistic description of the sexual network was not an aim of this study.</p>
      <p>For the sake of parsimony, we focused on relatively simple mathematical models with minimal sets of parameters, and thus left some important questions open for further study. In particular, we did not explore the effect of population structure, stochastic fluctuations, differences between subtypes, superinfection, and founder effects, and we considered only the situation of natural, untreated infection, thus appropriate to describing the evolution of the virus prior to the widespread adoption of antiretroviral therapy. We also did not address the question of conflicting directions of selection at the within and between host level, describing in-host changes in virulence instead as random drift. We hope to address these important questions in future work.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this paper, we developed a multi-strain evolutionary epidemiological model of HIV-1 virulence, and showed that it could accurately reproduce observations on the distribution of viral load and its heritability in transmitting couples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002185-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). We were able to estimate the proportion of variance in set-point viral load explained by viral genetic factors (26%, 1−(<italic>σ<sub>E</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>+<italic>σ<sub>M</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>)/<italic>σ<sub>P</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>), and separately how much these factors change (‘mutate’) from one infection to the next. Our best estimate is that virulence changes slowly towards an evolutionary optimum over decades, but we cannot rule out faster changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002185-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002185-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>).</p>
      <p>Our aim here was to develop a simple, parsimonious ‘broad-brush’ model to understand the principles of HIV-1 virulence evolution in a generalised epidemic using data currently available. Most of the parameters were derived from Sub-Saharan African studies (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002185.s005">Table S1</xref></bold>), suggesting that the model has most direct relevance for this context. This is our intention, as this is where most of the adaptation of HIV-1 to the human population has occurred. The parameters determining the curve of survival from disease progression were derived from European data, and since these data predate antiretroviral therapy they are not expected to differ substantially from parameters derived from Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p>We do not expect the epidemic in other contexts to differ drastically. Two studies which have observed a change in virulence in the Netherlands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gras1">[20]</xref> and Italy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller1">[21]</xref> appear to support our hypothesis as the virulence in both situations has risen from a sub-optimal level towards equilibrium, as predicted in our model. The same trend was not seen in Switzerland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller2">[22]</xref>, however, and further work is required to apply the model rigorously to the European context with a view to explaining these trends. More realistic predictions will require more detailed models, and by necessity more data. We list some factors that could be included in a more detailed analysis.</p>
      <p>Describing the differences between subtypes of HIV-1 seems like one of the biggest challenges to the model presented here. We considered virulence evolution on a single dimension of low-to-high, with single functions describing the relationship between viral load, infectiousness and duration of asymptomatic infection. HIV-1 subtypes in fact differ in their transmission parameters independently of their differences in SPVL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Baeten1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Kiwanuka1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Ng1">[8]</xref>. Subtype A shows a slower disease progression when compared to other subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Kanki1">[34]</xref>. More specifically, data from the Rakai study showed that subtype A infection results in slower disease progression than subtype D even though the distribution of SPVL is the same <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Baeten1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Kiwanuka1">[7]</xref>. From the same cohort it was shown that subtype A is also more transmissible than subtype D even when viral load and other confounding variables are controlled for in a regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Kiwanuka2">[35]</xref>. Subtype A is therefore fitter than D in both duration and transmissibility, and the evolutionary hypothesis would predict the gradual replacement of subtype D by subtype A, which has been observed in Uganda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Conroy1">[36]</xref> and Greece <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Paraskevis1">[37]</xref>. Other noteworthy trends include the dominance of subtype C in southern Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Tebit1">[38]</xref>, which may be a result of an extended period of high viraemia in primary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Novitsky1">[39]</xref>. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that HIV-1 virulence can change in ways not fully reflected by set-point viral load, and thus that more data are needed to identify other appropriate surrogate measures (or determinants) of virulence. More generally, the theoretical challenge is then to explain in terms of these other determinants of infectiousness and survival, how differences in virulence are maintained in different viral subtypes.</p>
      <p>There are a number of other directions in which our model could be developed. In this study the mutational variance, the extent to which the viral genotype changed from one infection to the next, was considered independent of the age of infection (AOI). At first, this may seem a paradoxical choice, since mutation which occurs between hosts must be the result of mutations and selection occurring within the infected host. It would reasonable to suggest that the size of between-host mutation is positively related to the AOI, since nucleotide divergence from the founding strain has been shown to occur at a constant rate during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Shankarappa1">[40]</xref>. If this were the case, the between-host mutation rate would be the same regardless of the generation time and consequently of the virulence of the virus. However, a study of within-host evolution over time found that the rate of divergence from the founding genotype was positively correlated with viral load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Bello1">[41]</xref>, suggesting that higher virulence infections diverge more rapidly. A model with a mutational variance independent of the AOI allows for this, as a higher virulence virus will have more generations in a given amount of time and therefore more between-host mutation events.</p>
      <p>An accurate functional representation of mutational variance as a function of AOI thus requires more detailed understanding than seems currently possible. To resolve this, and for the sake of parsimony, we assume that the two effects described above cancel each other out, and thus that the mutational variance is independent of AOI. To test the sensitivity to this assumption, we changed the model to include AOI-dependent mutational variance (linearly increasing as a function of time), and the results were qualitatively and quantitatively similar (data not shown).</p>
      <p>An additional problem with this model is that the data to which the model is fitted consists of transmission pairs, for most of whom the age of infection at which transmission occurs is unknown. Assuming an AOI-independent mutational variance considerably reduces the complexity of the analysis. There is however little doubt that extending the model to include a more detailed description of within-host processes and also resolving the effects of conflicting selection at the within and between host levels will be enlightening.</p>
      <p>The pattern of mutation was modelled as a log-normal distribution. It may be reasonable to assume that the distribution is negatively skewed because deleterious mutations are much more frequent than beneficial ones, for example in the case of protease gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Parera1">[42]</xref>. However, it is misleading to compare the between-host mutation process to the mutation of individual viral genomes because deleterious mutations may be counterbalanced by within-host selection for viable viruses and there is no evidence for asymmetry in the net effect.</p>
      <p>The host effect in this study was also modelled by a log-normal distribution which is justified if there are a large number of host effects and they are assumed to each have a multiplicative effect on SPVL. Host effects are known to account for a certain quantity of SPVL variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gao1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Richardson1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Fellay1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Jones1">[43]</xref> and a very low estimate of the environmental variance would not be consistent with these studies. The maximum likelihood estimate of <italic>σ<sub>E</sub></italic> was encouragingly high (<italic>σ<sub>E</sub></italic> = 0.66, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002185-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>), contributing 71% of the total variance in SPVL. As more is understood about how the host contributes to variation in SPVL, this source of variance may be further decomposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Fellay1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The epidemiological component of this model could be made more realistic. The model could for example be structured by age, sex, location, sexual activity, HLA type and include stochastic effects. It is not clear to us what effect on virulence these heterogeneities will have, but they might help for example explain the persistence of diversity between subtypes and help provide reasonable initial conditions, since a stochastic model could elucidate which viruses are more likely to have started the epidemic. The analysis could be further developed by relaxing the assumption that the SPVL is at an evolutionary optimal equilibrium, though we note that this assumption provides good agreement with data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002185-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). We note that the mean log<sub>10</sub> SPVL and its heritability do not change substantially in the later stages of the epidemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002185-g004"><bold>Figure 4a–c</bold></xref>), and the mean log<sub>10</sub> SPVL of the Ugandan data (4.51) is close to the predicted equilibrium value (4.52), suggesting that even if the observed data do not represent an equilibrium, they represent something close enough to render the maximum likelihood parameter estimations reasonable.</p>
      <p>Despite being simple and parsimonious rather than detailed, our model provides a general framework that makes use of the most recent data on the heritability of set-point viral load, and that can be used to interpret past and predict future trends in SPVL.</p>
      <p>One interesting trend is that the mean log<sub>10</sub> SPVL can be observed to increase above the equilibrium value for a short while during the early stages of the epidemic. Epidemic growth is expected to favour a higher virulence than at equilibrium as a result of the cumulative advantage of rapid transmission when hosts are abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Fraser1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Bolker1">[44]</xref>. This is better demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002185-g005"><bold>Figure 5(c)</bold></xref> which shows the evolution of the mean log<sub>10</sub> SPVL from a founding virulence very close to the equilibrium mean. At this level of resolution the temporary spike in virulence can be seen, and this corresponds to the period of epidemic growth. As the number of susceptible individuals grows and the epidemic begins to slow, the virulence decreases in response towards equilibrium as longer-lived genotypes are favoured.</p>
      <p>This suggests that if SPVL can evolve at the between-host level then a growing epidemic could select for higher virulence viruses. Bolker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Bolker1">[44]</xref> model this phenomenon and suggest that the peak of this transient virulence is likely to occur late within the first exponential growth phase of the epidemic, so if this were observable the virulence is likely still to be in this transient state above the equilibrium. Whether this phenomenon has contributed to the recent increase in virulence in Italy and the Netherlands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gras1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Mller1">[21]</xref> cannot be distinguished from an increase in virulence as a result of the founder having sub-optimal virulence. A future slight decrease in virulence as an epidemic saturates would provide evidence for this hypothesis, if it could be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Bolker1">[44]</xref>. The optimum virulence could also be shifted by a widespread intervention which affects the nature of transmission such as circumcision, vaccination, or antiretroviral therapy. In the current study we introduced a model which may be used to predict such effects on virulence.</p>
      <p>Recently published studies reporting the development of a reasonably effective vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-RerksNgarm1">[45]</xref> and a protective vaginal gel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Karim1">[46]</xref> are promising in the fight against HIV transmission. Hypothetically, a vaccine may offer more protection against lower virulence genotypes and select for more virulent ones, or vice versa. Gandon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Gandon1">[47]</xref> produced simple models which suggested that vaccines which target infection or transmission should have a negligible or negative effect on virulence as reducing the rate of transmission benefits pathogens which keep their host alive longer. However they also modelled vaccines which reduce the growth or the toxicity of the pathogen and suggest that this would select for pathogens which have higher virulence which would have a negative effect when unvaccinated individuals were infected.</p>
      <p>Antiretroviral therapy during asymptomatic infection reduces transmission rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Attia1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-HIV1">[49]</xref>, presumably by reducing viral load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Reynolds1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002185-Donnell1">[51]</xref>. Antiretroviral therapy would therefore modify the relationship between SPVL, transmission and duration of asymptomatic infection, and it is possible to construct hypothetical scenarios that could select for either increased or decreased SPVL. In summary, our model could be used to predict (in general terms) the effects different interventions would have on virulence. These changes are expected to be relatively modest compared to gains obtained by curtailing transmission, but nonetheless some consideration should be given to the possibility of increased virulence and whether it could be mitigated.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Our results support the hypothesis that the distribution of SPVL, and by implication of HIV-1 virulence, can plausibly be explained by selection for increased transmission in populations, though differences between viral subtypes needs to be elucidated in future work. Our method disaggregates the effects of viral factors acting to determine SPVL, the effect of mutation (and thus indirectly within-host evolution), and other environmental and host factors. The best estimates indicate a relatively high proportion of SPVL explained by viral factors (26%), as well as a modest rate of evolution of putative viral virulence factors. Reconciling these findings with data on within-host viral evolution may yet shed further light on the role of viral factors in HIV-1 pathogenesis.</p>

        <p>In order to simplify simulations, we modelled a discrete finite set of viral strains (‘genotype’), each capable of producing a finite range of possible SPVL (‘phenotype’).</p>
        <p>Each infected host in the model carries a viral genotype, <italic>i</italic>, and has a phenotype, <italic>j</italic>.

        <p>Each genotype is defined by a predisposition to give rise to higher or lower SPVL.
