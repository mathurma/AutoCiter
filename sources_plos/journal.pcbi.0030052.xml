Using an exactly solvable lattice model, we design sequences with selected thermal properties. Compositional analysis of designed model sequences and natural proteomes reveals a specific trend in amino acid compositions in response to the requirement of stability at elevated environmental temperature: the increase of fractions of hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues at the expense of polar ones. We show that this “from both ends of the hydrophobicity scale” trend is due to positive (to stabilize the native state) and negative (to destabilize misfolded states) components of protein design. Negative design strengthens specific repulsive non-native interactions that appear in misfolded structures. A pressure to preserve specific repulsive interactions in non-native conformations may result in correlated mutations between amino acids that are far apart in the native state but may be in contact in misfolded conformations. Such correlated mutations are indeed found in TIM barrel and other proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>What mechanisms does Nature use in her quest for thermophilic proteins?

In particular, the physical basis for the ability of proteins to achieve an adaptation to a wide variety of external conditions is still poorly understood. While several attempts to design proteins with a desired fold were successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b003">3</xref>], rational design of proteins with desired thermal properties is still an elusive goal. However, Nature apparently succeeds in doing so by “designing” proteins in hyperthermophiles that are stable and functional up to 110 °C. Thus, in the absence of the complete solution of the protein design problem, it is tempting to get clues from Nature as to how thermal properties of proteins can be modulated by proper sequence selection and which physical factors play a role in this process.</p><p>A clear manifestation of thermophilic adaptation can be found in a highly statistically significant variation of amino acid compositions of proteomes between meso- and thermophilic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b007">7</xref>]. Recently, we showed that the total concentration of seven amino acids, I, V, Y, W, R, E, and L, is highly correlated with optimal growth temperature (OGT) of an organism (<italic>R</italic> = 0.93) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b008">8</xref>]. The total concentration of IVYWREL combination of amino acids serves as a predictor of OGT with mean accuracy of 8.9 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b008">8</xref>]. In this work we seek a fundamental theoretical explanation as to why Nature requires an elevated concentration of both hydrophobic and charged amino acids to design hyperthermostable proteins.</p><p>Our first goal here is to develop a minimalistic physical model of protein design that could help us to rationalize comparative proteomic analysis of thermo- and mesophiles. A crucial question is how to incorporate the environmental temperature in the model of protein design. Two factors may play a role. The first effect is due to fundamental statistical mechanics of proteins that posit that stable and foldable proteins should have an “energy gap” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b012">12</xref>]. Specifically, the stability of the native state of a protein is determined by the Boltzmann factor exp(−ΔE/k<sub>B</sub>T), where ΔE is the energy gap between the native state and lowest energy completely misfolded structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b015">15</xref>]. Therefore, to maintain their stability at elevated temperature, the thermophilic proteins should have a greater energy gap. In principle, the increase of the energy gap can be achieved by lowering the energy of the native state (positive design), raising the energy of misfolds (negative design), or both. Another factor that may affect protein thermostability is a possible dependence of fundamental interactions (e.g., hydrophobic forces) on temperature. However, the temperature dependence of different types of interactions may be very complex, and it remains a subject of controversy as to how and to what extent it influences the stability of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b019">19</xref>]. Our approach to this complex issue is simple: consider first how far one can go based on purely statistical–mechanical analysis of protein thermostability without resorting to explanations based on temperature dependence of various interactions. Specifically, here we use the 27-mer cubic lattice model of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b021">21</xref>]. The model features 20 types of amino acids that interact when they are nearest neighbors on the lattice; interaction energy depends on types of amino acids involved. The potential is derived from known protein structures and is temperature-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b022">22</xref>]. For this lattice model all compact conformations can be enumerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b020">20</xref>] and, therefore, exact statistical–mechanical analysis is possible. Previously, protein thermodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b023">23</xref>], folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b025">25</xref>], and evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b027">27</xref>] were extensively studied by using this model. We simulate the process of thermal adaptation by the design of 27-mer sequences with selected (at a given environmental temperature <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>) thermal properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b015">15</xref>]. The algorithm of design (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) carries out simultaneous unrestricted search in conformational, sequence, and amino acid composition spaces. In our analysis we will focus on the amino acid composition of designed sequences as a function of the environmental temperature and we will compare the model findings with amino acid trends in real proteomes. Our main result is that thermal adaptation utilizes both positive and negative design. We show that by increasing the content of amino acids from both extremes of the hydrophobicity scale, thermostable proteins achieve exactly that goal: hydrophobic residues help with positive design while elevated concentration of charged residues helps to achieve stronger negative design. Further, we find an interesting and potentially important aspect of negative design: similar to positive design that strengthens certain native interactions, negative design can make specific non-native interactions strongly repulsive. This, in turn, may lead to emergence of correlated mutations between amino acids that are not in contact in native structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We design lattice model proteins with selected thermostability as a first step toward modeling thermal adaptation of organisms. There is a direct connection between OGT (environmental temperature, or <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>) of an organism and the melting temperature of its proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b029">29</xref>]. We used the P–design procedure to create model 27-mer sequences that are stable at selected <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).

The dependence of <italic>&lt;T<sub>melt</sub>&gt;</italic> on <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> is close to linear and qualitatively matches the empirical linear relationship, <italic>T<sub>melt</sub> =</italic> 24.4 <italic>+</italic> 0.93 <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>, between the average living temperature of the organism and melting temperature of its proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b028">28</xref>].</p><p>As expected, the amino acid composition of designed proteins does depend on <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> for which they were designed. To quantify the differences between “low-temperature” and “high-temperature” amino acid compositions, we plotted temperature dependencies of the fractions of hydrophobic (LVWIFMPC), weak hydrophophobic and polar (AGNQSTHY), and charged (DEKR) amino acids for designed lattice proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and natural (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) proteomes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows a significant increase in the amount of charged residues (red triangles) and a slight increase in hydrophobic amino acids (green squares) at the expense of polar ones (black dots). Remarkably, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g001">Figure 1</xref> suggest that increase of thermostability is accompanied by growth of amino acid content from both extremes of the hydrophobicity scale, adding both charged and hydrophobic residues. This observation is further highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g002">Figure 2</xref>, which shows—amino acid by amino acid—how compositions of model proteins with <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> in designed model proteomes for all 20 amino acids are ranked by their hydrophobicity according to the Miyazawa–Jernigan set of interaction parameters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030052-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030052-sg002">S2</xref>B for more detailed explanation). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g002">Figure 2</xref> clearly shows that addition of amino acids to thermophilic model proteomes occurs from the extremes of the hydrophobicity scale while the middle is depressed. The content of charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg; DEKR) and four of the hydrophobic (Ile, Leu, Phe, Cys; ILFC) residues is increased with temperature at the expense of other residues, mostly polar ones. This observation shows that combining amino acids with maximum variance in their hydrophobicity is crucial for creating hyperthermostable model proteins. We refer to this effect as the “from both ends of hydrophobicity scale” trend.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030052-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030052.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Temperature Dependences of the Fractions of Hydrophobic (LVWIFMPC), Weak Hydrophophobic and Polar (AGNQSTHY), and Charged (DEKR) Amino Acids Plotted Against Temperature <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> in the Design Experiment (A) and for Real Proteomes (B)</title><p>The data received in P-design procedure applied to sets of 5,000 27-mer sequences with random amino acid composition, using a different value of <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> for each set, 0.3 &lt; <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> &lt; 0.8 (<italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> is measured Miyazawa–Jernigan dimensionless units).

In this case, one (hydrophobic) end of the scale is responsible for positive design while another (hydrophilic) end provides negative design.

However, the question remains as to how positive and negative design is related to the “from both ends” trend in amino acid compositions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g002">Figure 2</xref>. To address this question, we plot the number of contacts between amino acids whose content grows with <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g002">Figure 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows how the average number of contacts (per structure) within both groups of amino acids, FILC and DEKR, in native conformations and in misfolded decoys, depends on <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>. Remarkably, we see that in decoy structures the growth of the number of contacts occurs only within the “charged” group DEKR, some of which—according to the Miyazawa–Jernigan potential—repel one another. On the other hand, the number of contacts in the hydrophobic group in decoys do not change despite an overall increase of concentration of these amino acids in sequences designed at higher <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>. This result shows that while strongly mutually attractive hydrophobic groups provide lower energies of native states for hyperthermophilic model proteins, the growth in concentration of “charged” (DEKR) groups mainly contributes to the negative design factor by raising average energy of misfolded conformations. Remarkably, the average number of contacts between hydrophobic groups (FILC) in misfolded conformations remain roughly the same in meso- and hyperthermophilic model proteins despite significant growth in overall concentration of these groups in hyperthermophiles. Therefore, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g005">Figure 5</xref> indicate that the “from both ends” trend in amino acid composition is directly related to positive and negative design in stabilization of hyperthermophilic model proteins.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030052-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030052.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Average Number of Contacts between Amino Acids Whose Fraction Increases in Thermophilic Model Sequences (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g001">Figure 1</xref>)</title><p>(A) Contacts in native structures.

However, a question arises whether negative design works by increasing “average” non-native interactions or by strengthening certain specific repulsive non-native interactions. Indeed, negative design may be based on introducing a few energetically disadvantageous non-native contacts that are persistent in many decoy structures, increasing their energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b030">30</xref>]. Therefore, non-native contacts responsible for negative design may well be specific for each sequence, making this effect more detectable if individual proteins are considered.</p><p>The exact nature of the lattice model makes a detailed residue-by-residue analysis of the action of both positive and negative design possible. To this end, it is instructive to identify interactions, native and non-native contacts, between residues that play especially important roles in stabilization of the native state and destabilization of decoys. The key idea here is that such important interactions should be conserved in all sequences that fold into a given structure. While identities of amino acids that form such a contact may vary from sequence to sequence, the strength (or energy) of key native or non-native contacts will be preserved: it will be either strongly repulsive or strongly attractive for all sequences that fold into a given structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b031">31</xref>]. Therefore, to identify such key contacts, distributions of energies of native and non-native contacts in multiple sequences that fold into the same native structure should be considered. Such analysis can reveal not only conserved strong native contacts but also possible conserved strong repulsive non-native contacts. To investigate such possibility, we designed 5,000 lattice proteins that all fold into the same (randomly chosen) native structure. To achieve that, we used the design algorithm similar to P-design (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), but for a fixed native structure, and checked a posteriori that the target structure is indeed the native state for all 5,000 sequences. We designed a set of 5,000 mesophilic sequences at <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> = 0.2 and 5,000 hyperthermophilic sequences that fold to the same structure but are much more stable (<italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> = 0.8).</p><p>The concept of native and non-native contacts for our lattice model is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g006">Figure 6</xref>A. It is a cartoon with a zoom-in into the contact matrix of the lattice structure used in simulations. The contact matrix of any compact lattice conformation contains all native (green, total 28 in any structure) and all possible non-native (blue, total 128) contacts. All other contacts (red) are prohibited according to the properties of the cubic lattice. To identify important native and non-native contacts whose energies are conserved, we applied the following procedure. First, for each of the 5,000 sequences that fold into selected structure, we calculated energies of 28 native and 128 possible non-native contacts in this structure (using the identities of residues and Myazawa–Jernigan potentials that were employed to design sequences). Next, for each contact we calculated average energy and its standard deviation over all 5,000 designed sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g006">Figure 6</xref>B for illustration of this calculation). Contacts whose energy shows a very low standard deviation over all designed sequences are apparently the ones that are most important for stability. This procedure was carried out both for mesophilic sequences (<italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> = 0.2) and for thermophilic sequences (<italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic> = 0.8). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g007">Figure 7</xref>, which presents standard deviation of interaction energies of each native and non-native contact over all 5,000 designed mesophilic sequences (A) and hyperthermophilic sequences (B), plotted against the average (over 5,000 designed sequences) energy of that contact. The plot consists of 28 + 128 = 156 points, covering all native and all possible non-native interactions. The native state clearly defines conserved low- and high-energy native contacts (shown in black) in most of the sequences, as the standard deviation is the lowest at the extreme values of the energy. Conserved attractive interactions are in the protein interior, corresponding to the lattice analog of the hydrophobic core; apparently, they emerge due to the action of positive design. The non-native contacts (red dots) follow a different pattern, with only a few conserved attractive interactions, suggesting the diversity of decoy structures. What is surprising to see, however, is that energies of certain most-repulsive (high-energy) non-native contacts show a very low standard deviation, indicating that such contacts may be as important for protein stability as conserved native ones. Comparison of meso- and hyperthermophilic sequences shows clearly that emergence of strong and conserved attractive and repulsive interactions in key native and non-native contacts is directly related to sequence design that generates stable sequences: design of hyperthermostable sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) results in stronger and more conserved (lower dispersion of energy) attractive and repulsive specific native and non-native interactions. The only reason that repulsive energies of non-native contacts are conserved is that such contacts persist in certain frequent decoy structures and contribute to the widening of the gap between the native state and decoys. Such repulsive contacts are indirectly (via the sequence) related to a particular native state and are not numerous. Their role may be completely obscured in a “high-throughput” analysis where sequences with different native states are considered together, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Therefore, we conclude that negative design involves a very specific strategic placement of repulsive contacts in certain decoy structures.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030052-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030052.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Illustration of the Calculation of Energy Dispersion of Native and Non-Native Contacts for the Lattice Model</title><p>(A) Zoom-in into contact matrix of one of the 103,346 compact lattice conformations, the cartoon.

The requirement to conserve the energy of key contacts in multiple sequences that fold into the same structure implies that amino acids forming such contacts can mutate in a correlated way, for example by swaps. The observation that mutations may occur often as swaps to preserve specific attractive native and specific repulsive non-native interactions leads to a prediction of a peculiar dependence between frequency of amino acid substitutions (as in, e.g., BLOSUM matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b032">32</xref>]) and interaction energy between amino acids. Indeed, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g008">Figure 8</xref>, a correlated mutation in the form of a swap can manifest itself in sequence alignment as a substitution between amino acids that are making the swap. The implication is that frequent substitutions will be observed between amino acids that strongly attract each other (to preserve specific stabilizing native contacts). More interesting and perhaps more surprising, frequent substitutions are also predicted between amino acids that strongly repel each other (to preserve specific non-native repulsive contacts). In other words, we predict that the scatter plot between elements of amino acid interaction energy matrix and substitution matrix will be non-monotonic with maxima at both extremes.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030052-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030052.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Schematic Illustration of the Concept of Mutations by Swaps</title><p>(A) A cartoon schematically shows how mutations by swaps preserve the contact energy for some important native (blue) and non-native (red) contacts in Sequence 2, which folds to the same native state as Sequence 1.

The striking feature of this dependence is that most frequent substitutions are observed not only between the most attractive amino acids but also between the most repulsive ones. One could argue, however, that the high frequency of substitutions between amino acids that repel each other may be a trivial consequence of conserved substitutions that preserve the charge (R to K and E to D). However, a detailed inspection of the upper right part of the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g009">Figure 9</xref>A shows that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030052-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Indeed, frequent substitutions are observed between mutually repulsive amino acids with vastly different physical–chemical properties and encoded by very dissimilar codons, such as Serine to Asparagine, Glutamin to Arginine, etc. Several highly nonconservative substitutions show about “random”frequencies (element of BLOSUM matrix close to zero, e.g., for Asn to Lys), but this may be due to compensation of two opposite effects: suppression of highly nonconservative substitutions (e.g., that change charge) and facilitation of correlated substitutions such as the ones in the form of swaps as illustrated here.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030052-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030052.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Scatter Plots Showing the Dependence of the Elements of the BLOSUM62 Substitution Matrix on Interaction Energies between Amino Acid Residues (Approximated by Miyazawa–Jernigan Parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b022">22</xref>])</title><p>Only nonsynonymous substitutions are presented.</p><p>(A) A complete plot showing all 190 possible nonsynonymous pairs.

In particular, our recent analysis of complete bacterial proteomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b008">8</xref>] revealed that proteomes of thermophilic bacteria are enriched in both hydrophobic residues (IVYLW) and charged ones (ER), while all polar residues are suppressed.

A question arises as to whether our observations are generic or are due to the specific potential used to design model proteins. A detailed comparison of several potentials—all atom and group-based derived by different methods—was carried out recently in our lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b044">44</xref>]. Remarkably, we found that despite differences in detail all these potentials reflect the same dominant contributions to protein stabilization.

Further, it was found that knowledge-based potentials derived using structures of meso- and thermophilic proteins are virtually indistinguishable (KZ and ES, unpublished data).

It was shown that charged residues can be effectively used in negative design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b030">30</xref>]. Another indirect evidence of the contribution of charged residues to negative design emerges from site-directed mutagenesis, where mutations of polar groups to charged ones on the surface of a protein lead to protein stabilization even in the absence of salt–bridge partners of the mutated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b049">49</xref>].

The dependence of substitution rates in sequences of natural proteins (BLOSUM62 substitution matrix) on interaction energies according to knowledge-based Miyazawa–Jernigan potential has a peculiar nonmonotonic shape showing elevated substitution rates between residues that attract each other as well as between residues that repel each other. The physical reason for this phenomenon is the same as for the “both ends of hydrophobicity scale” trend: simultaneous action of positive and negative design. Upon substitutions, energy of attractive contacts in native states should be preserved as well as energies of specific repulsive contacts in misfolded conformations. Apparently both these factors act in concert to preserve the energy gap in proteins.</p><p>Our study deepens an understanding of correlated mutations in proteins. With regard to native contacts, the fact that amino acids making strongly attractive native interactions should exhibit correlated mutations had been realized long ago. Several authors proposed to use correlated mutations as a tool to determine possible native contacts from multiple sequence alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b036">36</xref>]. However, this suggestion is complicated by the observation that correlated mutations are often found between residues that have no obvious functional role and are distant in structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b053">53</xref>]. Using the double mutant technique, Horovitz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b033">33</xref>] suggested a relation between correlated mutations and energetic connectivity (i.e., nonadditivity of stability effects in double mutation cycles) between corresponding amino acids. Green and Shortle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b054">54</xref>] showed that amino acids that are distant in structure may indeed be “energetically coupled,” attributing this effect to influence of mutations on the unfolded state of proteins, consistent with our findings. Lockless and Ranganathan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b038">38</xref>] suggested that a “pathway of energetic connectivity” exists between distant residues that exhibit correlated mutations. Fodor and Aldrich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b037">37</xref>], however, examined several other proteins and argued against the “general principle of isolated pathways of evolutionarily conserved energetic connectivity in proteins.” Here we show that negative design that destabilizes misfolded conformations of proteins may be responsible for correlated mutations between residues that are far apart in native structures.</p><p>In this work, we developed a simple exact model of thermophilic adaptation and discovered fundamental statistical–mechanical rules that Nature uses in her quest to enhance protein stability.

The melting temperature <italic>T<sub>melt</sub></italic> is found numerically from the condition <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>(<italic>T<sub>melt</sub></italic>) = 0.5. Note that if the energy spectrum <italic>E<sub>i</sub></italic> is sparse enough at low energies, the value of <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> is determined chiefly by the energy gap <italic>E<sub>1</sub> – E<sub>0</sub></italic> between the native state and the closest decoy structure that has no structural relation to the native state.
			</p><p>To design lattice proteins, we use here a Monte-Carlo procedure (P-design, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b015">15</xref>]) that maximizes the Boltzmann probability P<sub>nat</sub> of the native state by introducing mutations in the amino acid sequence and accepting or rejecting them according to the Metropolis criterion. As this procedure takes the environmental temperature T<sub>env</sub> as an input physical parameter, and generates amino acid sequences designed to be stable at T<sub>env</sub>, it is an obvious choice for modeling the thermophilic adaptation.</p><p>Initially, the sequence is chosen at random; the frequencies of all amino acid residues in the initial sequences are equal to 5%. At each Monte-Carlo step, a random mutation of one amino acid in a sequence is attempted and <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> of the mutated protein is determined. The native structure is determined at every step of the simulation; generally, the native state changes upon mutation of the sequence. If the value of <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> increased, the mutation is always accepted; if <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> decreased, the mutation is accepted with the probability exp[−(<italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>(old) − <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>(new))/<italic>p</italic>], with <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 (a Metropolis-like criterion). We chose <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 so that the average melting temperature of designed proteins is higher than the environmental temperature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030052-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), in agreement with experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b055">55</xref>]. The design procedure is stopped after 2,000 Monte-Carlo iterations. Such length of design runs is sufficient to overcome any possible effects of the initial composition of the sequences, so the amino acid composition of the designed sequences depends only on the environmental temperature <italic>T<sub>env</sub></italic>.</p><p>To relate the trends in amino acid composition with the physical properties and interaction energies of individual amino acids, we use hydrophobicity as a generic parameter characterizing an amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b042">42</xref>]. To characterize the hydrophobicity of amino acids in the simulations, we make use of the fact that the Miyazawa–Jernigan interaction energy matrix is very well approximated by its spectral decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b043">43</xref>]. Interestingly, it is sufficient to use only one eigenvector <italic>q,</italic> corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, so the interaction (contact) energy <italic>E<sub>ij</sub></italic> between amino acids of types <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> reads <italic>E<sub>ij</sub></italic> ≈ <italic>E<sub>0</sub> + λq<sub>i</sub>q<sub>j</sub></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b043">43</xref>]. In this representation, hydrophobic residues have the largest values of <italic>q,</italic> while hydrophilic (charged) residues correspond to small <italic>q</italic>.</p><p>All sequences of TIM–barrel folds with length less than 300 amino acid residues were extracted according to the SCOP database description [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b056">56</xref>]. Identical sequences were excluded from further consideration. Remaining sequences (total 39) were aligned against the sequence of the triosephosphate isomerase (7tim.pdb, chain a) by using Kalign Web-server for multiple alignment of protein sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://msa.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/msa.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://msa.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/msa.cgi</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b057">57</xref>]).</p><p>Correlated substitutions in the multiple alignments were determined by using the CRASP program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/crasp" xlink:type="simple">http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/crasp</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030052-b040">40</xref>]).
