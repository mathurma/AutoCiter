<p>A study of Huntington's disease reveals that neurons might fail to cope with maintaining their function during the pre-symptomatic, pathogenic phases of HD, possibly due to the early repression of key longevity-promoting transcription factors by abnormal developmental signaling.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The Wnt receptor Ryk is an evolutionary-conserved protein important during neuronal differentiation through several mechanisms, including γ-secretase cleavage and nuclear translocation of its intracellular domain (Ryk-ICD). Although the Wnt pathway may be neuroprotective, the role of Ryk in neurodegenerative disease remains unknown. We found that Ryk is up-regulated in neurons expressing mutant huntingtin (HTT) in several models of Huntington's disease (HD). Further investigation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and mouse striatal cell models of HD provided a model in which the early-stage increase of Ryk promotes neuronal dysfunction by repressing the neuroprotective activity of the longevity-promoting factor FOXO through a noncanonical mechanism that implicates the Ryk-ICD fragment and its binding to the FOXO co-factor β-catenin. The Ryk-ICD fragment suppressed neuroprotection by <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk loss-of-function in expanded-polyQ nematodes, repressed FOXO transcriptional activity, and abolished β-catenin protection of mutant htt striatal cells against cell death vulnerability. Additionally, Ryk-ICD was increased in the nucleus of mutant htt cells, and reducing γ-secretase PS1 levels compensated for the cytotoxicity of full-length Ryk in these cells. These findings reveal that the Ryk-ICD pathway may impair FOXO protective activity in mutant polyglutamine neurons, suggesting that neurons are unable to efficiently maintain function and resist disease from the earliest phases of the pathogenic process in HD.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neuronal cell decline in neurodegenerative disease can be caused by inherited mutations and involves neuronal dysfunction followed by neuronal death. The ability of neurons to cope with the chronic stress induced by mutant protein expression may determine the course of their decline and eventual demise. Although the pathophysiological importance of these stress responses has been previously shown, very little is known about the signaling networks that regulate neuronal homeostasis during the early presymptomatic—but pathogenic—phases of a neurodegenerative disorder such as Huntington's disease (HD). In particular, it remains unclear whether neuronal differentiation factors regulate stress response pathways during neurodegenerative disease and how this might impact the overall capacity of neurons to cope with stress and maintain their function. Here, we show that the Wnt receptor Ryk, a protein known to be important for neurogenesis, is increased in different animal models of HD, before or during the early phases of the disease process. Interestingly, increased levels of Ryk repress activity of the FOXO proteins—a family of transcription factors that play a role in cell survival/longevity and in neuronal homeostasis and protection. Ryk represses FOXO protective activity, possibly directly, through its intracellular domain, a product of γ-secretase–mediated cleavage previously implicated in the birth of new cortical neurons. This highlights the regulation of HD neuron survival by a Ryk-dependent pathway that is distinct from canonical Wnt/Ryk signaling. From our findings, we postulate that neurons are unable to develop an efficient FOXO-mediated survival response during the very early, pathogenic phases of HD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell stress response factors are important for cells to maintain function in a large variety of normal and pathological contexts, including diseases linked to proteotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Kikis1">[1]</xref>. Among these factors, the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors is central to longevity and cellular homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Eijkelenboom1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Salih1">[3]</xref>. Additionally, FOXO factors may be important to the regulation of neuron survival in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Neri1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parmentier1">[5]</xref>, a dominantly inherited CAG repeat disorder caused by expanded polyglutamines (polyQ) in the N-terminal portion of huntingtin (HTT) and characterized by striatal and cortical degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Gil1">[6]</xref>. FOXO may indeed promote neuron survival in simple models of HD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker1">[7]</xref> and cellular proteostasis in simple models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Cohen1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, the canonical Wnt pathway component β-catenin may functionally interact with FOXO in oxidative stress signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Essers1">[9]</xref> and has a neuroprotective role in models of the early phases of the pathogenic process in HD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker2">[10]</xref>. This suggests that the canonical Wnt pathway may interact with the FOXO pathway to promote diseased-neuron function and survival, which is in line with the notion that neuronal differentiation factors such as Wnts may promote adult neuron survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Inestrosa1">[11]</xref>. However, Wnt signaling effectors may be impaired in HD and AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Caricasole1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Gines1">[14]</xref>, raising the possibility that Wnt pathways may have a dual role in the regulation of neurodegeneration. Here, we hypothesized that alteration of Wnt pathways might antagonize the FOXO pathway to compromise cell stress response and neuronal resistance during the earliest phases of the pathogenic process in neurodegenerative disease such as HD. To test for this hypothesis, we used <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> transgenics that recapitulate an early phase of mutant HTT toxicity, namely neuronal dysfunction before cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker3">[15]</xref>. At the young adult stage, these animals show a dramatic loss of response to light touch produced by polyQ-expanded exon-1 like HTT fused to GFP in touch receptor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker3">[15]</xref>. To assess the mechanisms that underlie the dysfunction of these neurons, we performed a microarray analysis of primary neurons upon Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) of embryonic cells. This analysis emphasized the deregulation of neuronal differentiation genes, notably genes that are up-regulated in expanded-polyQ nematodes and in the brain of HD patients such as Ryk. Ryk is an evolutionary-conserved Wnt receptor (<italic>lin-18</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) that is important to neurogenesis and axon guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lyu1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Keeble1">[18]</xref> and that is involved in the regulation of developmental/postdevelopmental processes such as planar cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Macheda1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Andre1">[20]</xref>, regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Hollis1">[21]</xref>, and hematopoietic repopulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Povinelli1">[22]</xref>. Further investigation revealed that loss-of-function (LOF) of <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk in polyQ nematodes and reduction of Ryk levels in mouse striatal cells derived from HdhQ111 knock-in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Trettel1">[23]</xref> strongly protected from expanded polyQ/mutant HTT. Neuroprotection by <italic>lin-18</italic> LOF in expanded-polyQ nematodes, a cell-autonomous process, required the neuroprotective factor <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker1">[7]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>lin-18</italic> represses the neuroprotective activity of <italic>daf-16</italic> in these animals. The intracellular domain of Ryk (Ryk-ICD), a γ-secretase cleavage product that translocates in the nucleus to control neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lyu1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Zhong1">[17]</xref>, was found to bind to the FOXO partner β-catenin, suggesting that Ryk-ICD may trigger the repression of FOXO by increased levels of Ryk in mutant polyQ neurons. In support of this mechanism, Ryk-ICD overexpression was sufficient to repress the transcriptional activity of FOXO3a, a protein that promotes the survival of mutant htt striatal cells. Additionally, LIN-18 ICD expression was sufficient to suppress neuroprotection by <italic>lin-18</italic> LOF in expanded-polyQ nematodes. This mechanism was further supported by results in mutant htt cells showing that (<italic>i</italic>) Ryk-ICD overexpression abolished the protective activity of β-catenin, which is consistent with the possibility that an excess of Ryk-ICD may bind and block this survival protein; (<italic>ii</italic>) reducing presenilin PS1 levels (which is protective) compensated for the cytotoxicity of full-length Ryk but not that of Ryk-ICD, implicating this γ-secretase in the toxic effects of Ryk; and (<italic>iii</italic>) nuclear levels of endogenous Ryk-ICD were increased compared to normal htt cells, corroborating a role for the Ryk-ICD pathway in triggering abnormal Ryk signaling in mutant htt cells. Finally, Ryk was suggested to have a pathological role in HD as emphasized by the early stage (before or during the onset of pathology) increase of Ryk in expanded-polyQ nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker1">[7]</xref> and the neostriatum of 140CAG knock-in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Hickey1">[24]</xref>. Collectively, these results suggest that Ryk and its ICD fragment may reduce the ability of mutant polyQ neurons to handle cell stress and maintain function by repressing FOXO protective activity, which may occur during the earliest phases of the pathogenic process in HD.</p>

<title>Microarray Data Analysis Highlights Axon Guidance Pathways</title>
<p>To explore the pathways that underlie the early phases of expanded-polyQ neurotoxicity, we performed a microarray analysis of mRNAs extracted from <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor cells. To this end, we used transgenic nematodes expressing polyQ-expanded (128Q) and normal (19Q) N-terminal HTT fused to GFP under the control of the <italic>mec-3</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker3">[15]</xref>, and transgenic nematodes expressing only GFP under the control of the same promoter as a control. In this model, expanded polyQ expression produces a strong level of neuronal dysfunction not found in normal polyQ animals, namely the loss of response to light touch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker3">[15]</xref>. GFP-positive cells were purified by cell sorting from primary cultures of embryonic cells prior to mRNA extraction and microarray analysis. Forty-one genes were deregulated in 19Q cells compared to cells expressing GFP only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s011">Table S1</xref>). A total of 2,070 genes were deregulated in 128Q cells compared to 19Q cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s012">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, only 18 of the 2,070 genes were also deregulated in 19Q nematode cells, suggesting that our microarray analysis has provided clean and specific information on the transcriptomic effects of expanded-polyQ expression. To analyze the biological content of these data, we used several methods including Gene Ontology analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and a powerful network-based method based on Fourier analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s020">Text S2</xref>). In contrast to the GO analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the GSEA and Fourier analyses highlighted several processes previously suspected to be altered in HD (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s019">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s003">Figure S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s013">Tables S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s015">S5</xref>), suggesting that nematode data are relevant to HD pathogenesis. Additionally, cell differentiation pathways such as Wnt signaling were emphasized as components potentially involved in expanded-polyQ neuron dysfunction, a trend also emphasized by the network-based analysis of data resulting from a large-scale functional RNAi screen in our expanded-polyQ nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lejeune1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among the up-regulated Fourier modules, module 40 (Wnt/TGF-β signaling) was of particular interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

To enhance the prioritization of candidate genes, we focused on pathways and processes that were highlighted by GSEA and by the Fourier analysis and that contained evolutionary conserved druggable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Russ1">[28]</xref> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s016">Table S6</xref>). Up-regulated module 40 was again pointed out, as it contained the largest number of genes in common with the GSEA and Fourier analyses (see Wnt, cell cycle, and TGF-β in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s014">Table S4</xref>) as well as 3 of the 25 genes deregulated in 128Q nematode cells and in the caudate nucleus of HD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Hodges1">[29]</xref>, among which was <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk.</p>

<title>Reducing Ryk Levels Decreases the Vulnerability of Mutant htt Striatal Cells</title>
<p>Having observed that neuronal dysfunction was suppressed by <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk LOF in 128Q nematodes, we tested if Ryk inhibition could decrease the cell death caused by full-length mutant HTT. To this end, we used striatal cells derived from the HdhQ111 knock-in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Trettel1">[23]</xref>. Mutant htt (109Q/109Q) striatal cells are abnormally susceptible to cell death as induced by serum deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Trettel1">[23]</xref>, a phenotype suitable for identifying modifiers of cell vulnerability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Arango1">[30]</xref>.

To test whether reducing Ryk levels may promote mutant htt striatal cell survival, we subjected 109Q/109Q and 7Q/7Q cells to Ryk siRNA treatment. Ryk siRNA treatment enhanced the survival of 109Q/109Q cells with no effect on 7Q/7Q cells, an effect unrelated to a change in HTT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

<title>Neuroprotection by <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk LOF Requires <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO Activity</title>
<p>We next sought to examine the mechanisms underlying neuroprotection by Ryk inhibition. We first tested whether neuroprotection by <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk LOF in expanded-polyQ nematodes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) occurred in a cell-autonomous manner.

Ryk participates in canonical Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lu1">[26]</xref> and there is a functional interaction between β-catenin, a downstream effector of canonical Wnt, and FOXO in oxidative stress signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Essers1">[9]</xref>.

<title>The Ryk ICD Binds to β-Catenin</title>
<p>Ryk signals through multiple mechanisms such as the canonical Wnt pathway and the nuclear translocation of its cleaved ICD to regulate neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lyu1">[16]</xref>. This suggests that one mechanism for Ryk to repress FOXO in mutant polyQ neurons might be the deregulation of canonical Wnt, a neuroprotective pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Inestrosa1">[11]</xref>. However, LOF of <italic>pop-1</italic>/TCF does not appear to modulate 128Q neurotoxicity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes (unpublished data), suggesting that the outcome of the canonical Wnt pathway is not critical to mutant polyQ neuron survival. We thus hypothesized that another mechanism for Ryk to repress FOXO in mutant polyQ neurons could involve a noncanonical mechanism, namely the binding of the Ryk-ICD to FOXO or its partner β-catenin.</p>
<p>It was previously shown that β-catenin associates with Ryk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Berndt1">[31]</xref>. Consistent with these findings, we also observed that β-catenin binds to Ryk by using constructs that code for Ryk with a Myc tag at the C-terminal end or an uncleavable Ryk mutant (Ryk: EGFRRc, a chimeric construct in which the transmembrane region was replaced with that of the EGF receptor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lyu1">[16]</xref>. These constructs were transfected into 293T cells (derived from human kidney cells) and cell lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblotting. In the cells expressing Ryk or uncleavable Ryk, immunonoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Ryk pulled down endogenous β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), as expected.</p>

<p>To examine if Ryk-ICD binds to β-catenin, Flag-tagged Ryk-ICD constructs were transfected into 293T cells. β-catenin was detected in the anti-Flag immunoprecipitate, suggesting that Ryk-ICD is sufficient to associate with β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar experiments aimed at testing for binding of Ryk-ICD to FOXO3a, a neuroprotective FOXO protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-MojsilovicPetrovic1">[32]</xref>, did not detect any interaction (unpublished data). Together, these results suggested that Ryk might signal onto FOXO through binding of its ICD fragment to the FOXO co-factor β-catenin.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title>Ryk-ICD Represses FOXO3a Activity in Luciferase Reporter Assays</title>
<p>We then sought to test whether an excess of Ryk may repress FOXO transcriptional activity. We also tested whether an excess of the γ-secretase–cleaved ICD of Ryk may have a similar effect, as the Ryk-ICD fragment associates with β-catenin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), a protein that promotes FOXO transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Essers1">[9]</xref>. We examined the activity of FOXO3a, a protein that is neuroprotective in models of motor neuron disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-MojsilovicPetrovic1">[32]</xref>, also protecting against cell death associated with mutant HTT in striatal cells from HdhQ111 knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4A</xref>/B). From here, we further examined the molecular relationships between FOXO3a, β-catenin, and Ryk in mutant polyQ toxicity. To this end, constructs encoding FOXO3a together with a Forkhead responsive element (FHRE)-luciferase reporter and internal control reporter were utilized to transfect mouse striatal cells that express normal HTT. Reducing β-catenin levels reduced luciferase activity compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4C</xref>/D), which is consistent with the ability of β-catenin to promote FOXO transcriptional activity in mouse cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Essers1">[9]</xref>. Overexpressing Ryk reduced luciferase activity to levels comparable to those observed for β-catenin siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that Ryk up-regulation can repress FOXO3a transcriptional activity. Western blotting indicated that this effect might be attributable to full-length Ryk and to a Ryk C-terminal fragment (Ryk CTF) of ∼47 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). However, the CTF fragment is too large to be the γ-secretase cleavage product of Ryk (Ryk-ICD, ∼40 kDa). The size of this fragment suggests that Ryk CTF contains the ICD plus the transmembrane domain and a portion of the extracellular domain, which is consistent with the possibility that other proteases might cleave the extracellular domain of Ryk near the transmembrane domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref>. The Ryk-ICD fragment was not visible, which might be attributable to a very short half-life of this fragment similar to what has been observed for the γ-secretase–cleaved intracellular fragment of transmembrane proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Cupers1">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, Ryk-ICD overexpression produced a similar reduction of luciferase activity compared to Ryk overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4C</xref>/D), indicating that Ryk-ICD is sufficient to repress FOXO3a transcriptional activity. Furthermore, overexpressing a mutant form of Ryk that cannot undergo γ-secretase cleavage (Ryk: EGFRRc) showed no effect on luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Mutant Ryk was detected as one fragment corresponding to full-length Ryk and one fragment corresponding to Ryk CTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast to cells transfected with wild-type Ryk, the full-length Ryk precursor appeared to be more abundant in cells transfected with mutant Ryk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that blocking the γ-site of Ryk may also block Ryk CTF generation, an effect that was previously shown for APP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Sastre1">[35]</xref> and that further points to putative similarities between Ryk and APP processing. Collectively, these results suggested that the generation of the Ryk-ICD fragment is important for the cytotoxic action of Ryk.</p>

<title>Ryk-ICD Is Cytotoxic in Mouse Striatal Cells Expressing Mutant htt</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether overexpressing the Ryk-ICD fragment may be cytotoxic in striatal cells derived from HdhQ111 knock-in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Trettel1">[23]</xref> and whether this involves β-catenin activity. To this end, striatal cells were transfected with either a construct coding for Myc-tagged Ryk-ICD or a construct coding for V5-tagged β-catenin, or both, and these cells were subjected to serum deprivation. The overexpression of Ryk-ICD showed no effect on normal htt cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figure 5C</xref>/D). These results are consistent with the absence of toxicity for LIN-18 and LIN-18 ICD overexpression in normal-polyQ nematodes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), supporting a model in which Ryk up-regulation represses a mechanism (FOXO activity) that specifically promotes mutant polyQ neuron survival. Although mutant htt cells have high endogenous Ryk levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), overexpressing Ryk-ICD potentiated cell mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figure 5C</xref>/D). This effect was moderate, however, suggesting that Ryk toxicity is close to a maximum in these cells. Consistent with the pro-survival role of β-catenin, overexpressing β-catenin reduced the cell death of mutant htt cells with no effect detected in normal htt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figure 5C</xref>/D). The protective effect of β-catenin overexpression in mutant htt cells was abolished by Ryk-ICD overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figure 5C</xref>/D), suggesting that Ryk-ICD may antagonize β-catenin activity. There was no significant difference between the mortality of mutant htt cells transfected with Ryk-ICD alone and that of cells co-transfected with Ryk-ICD and β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figure 5C</xref>/D). Nonetheless, cells co-transfected with Ryk-ICD and β-catenin showed similar levels of mortality compared to cells transfected with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figure 5C</xref>/D), suggesting that β-catenin overexpression may compensate for Ryk-ICD cytotoxicity to that extent. As such, these results might just reflect the parallel activity of two proteins with antagonistic properties in the regulation of cell survival. However, given that Ryk-ICD binds to β-catenin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g003">Figure 3</xref>), these results supported a model in which a functional cross-talk between Ryk-ICD and β-catenin contributes to Ryk-ICD cytotoxicity.</p>

<title>Reducing Presenilin 1 Levels Compensates for the Cytotoxicity of Full-Length Ryk in Mutant htt Mouse Striatal Cells</title>
<p>Our results in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons and mouse striatal cells suggest a model in which the repression of FOXO3a activity by Ryk in mutant polyQ cells is mediated by the Ryk-ICD fragment, a γ-secretase cleavage product. The γ-secretase complex has been previously implicated in HD through its role in HTT cleavage and production of N-terminal fragments CpA and CpB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Kegel1">[36]</xref>. Here, we sought to investigate the protective role of the γ-secretase complex relative to the pathological activity of Ryk in mutant polyQ cells. To this end, we tested whether decreasing the activity of the γ-secretase complex might promote the survival of mutant htt mouse striatal cells and whether this effect might compensate for Ryk toxicity in these cells. At this point in our study, we elected to measure caspase 3/7 activity instead of counting picnotic nuclei in order to perform faster and complementary measures of striatal cell mortality. We observed that reducing the expression of presenilins PS1 or PS2 enhanced the viability of mutant htt striatal cells, with no effect detected in normal htt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g006">Figure 6A</xref>/B). Most importantly, reducing the levels of PS1 compensated for the cytotoxic effect of overexpressing full-length Ryk but not that of overexpressing Ryk-ICD in mutant htt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The compensatory effects of reducing PS1 levels on Ryk cytotoxicity was accompanied by an apparent increase of full-length Ryk levels as inferred from Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). A decrease of the CTFs that may be generated by the sequential proteolysis of Ryk such as Ryk-CTF and Ryk-ICD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref> was also apparent, however to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Given that Ryk-ICD may result from PS1 cleavage, as previously investigated in PS1-deficients cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lyu1">[16]</xref>, these results suggested that Ryk toxicity may be triggered by the production of Ryk-ICD in mutant htt cells, which led us to analyze endogenous Ryk-ICD levels in these cells.</p>

<title>Ryk-ICD Is Increased in the Nucleus of Mutant htt Striatal Cells</title>
<p>The model supported by our data for Ryk to be toxic in HD suggests that Ryk-ICD levels might be increased in mutant polyQ cells. To explore this possibility, we used a newly obtained rabbit polyclonal Ryk-ICD antibody (anti-Ryk<sup>ICD</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref> to perform immunocytostaining of mouse striatal cells followed by confocal analysis. This antibody was raised against the Ryk-ICD fragment, and it recognizes Ryk species that contain the ICD including full-length Ryk and the Ryk-ICD fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref>. Depending on the type of cells and level of expression in these cells, this antibody may detect one or more of all possible Ryk species. The detection of Ryk species is also dependent on the methods used for expression analysis (see Western blot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s006">Figure S6</xref>) and likely to be dependent on epitope accessibility. Immunocytostaining of mouse striatal cells indicated that Ryk-ICD immunoreactivity was primarily localized in the nucleus, with little signal detected in the cytoplasm and no signal detected at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g007">Figure 7A</xref>/B). Additionally, the intensity of nuclear staining was decreased if Ryk expression is reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These results suggested that full-length Ryk might be rapidly processed to produce intracellular fragments that localize to the nucleus. Interestingly, nuclear Ryk-ICD levels appeared to be increased by about 25% in mutant htt cells compared to normal htt cells, with no change detected in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g007">Figure 7A</xref>/B). This effect was observed for normal and mutant htt cells cultured on the same slides and for cell nuclei having similar sizes between genotypes. We further investigated the possibility that nuclear Ryk-ICD levels may be increased by using an internal control for improved comparison of Ryk-ICD levels between normal and mutant htt cell nuclei. We elected to use Pol2 immunostaining as a second antigen, as we observed that Pol2 levels are similar between normal and mutant htt cells. Nuclear Ryk-ICD levels were increased by about 40% in mutant htt cells in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g007">Figure 7C</xref>/D). Collectively, these observations suggested that nuclear Ryk-ICD levels may be significantly increased in mutant htt cells, corroborating the <italic>C. elegans</italic> and striatal cell data on the toxic effects of Ryk-ICD overexpression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g006">6</xref>) and further supporting a model in which the ICD of Ryk triggers the detrimental effects of Ryk increase in mutant polyQ cells.</p>

<title>Striatal Ryk Expression Profiles in 140CAG Knock-in Mice and HD Patients</title>
<p>In 128Q nematodes, <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk is up-regulated at an early stage of touch receptor neuron genesis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s004">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s015">Table S5</xref>)—that is, before the onset of pathology (loss of touch response) as detected in late larvae/young adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker1">[7]</xref>. This led us to explore whether Ryk might be increased before or at an early stage of pathology in HD mice. Although there are a number of fragment and full-length genetic mouse models of HD, each possessing useful experimental outcomes that can be used to provide a greater understanding of the human disease process, full-length knock-in HD mice such as 140CAG mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Hickey1">[24]</xref> may provide the best possible genetic comparability to human HD. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from the striatum of 140CAG mice using a N-terminal Ryk antibody showed that Ryk can be detected as two bands, one band corresponding to full-length Ryk and a weaker band of ∼28 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). The weaker band likely corresponds to an extracellular fragment of Ryk that is generated by proteolytic cleavage near the transmembrane domain, illustrating again (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001895-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) the possibility that Ryk may be cleaved by several proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref>. Densitometric analysis of Ryk showed an increase of immunofluorescence activity in the neostriatum of 140CAG HD mice at 8 mo of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). To explore the chronological features of Ryk increase in the striatum of 140CAG mice, we performed immunohistochemical analysis and observed a significant age-dependent increase of Ryk levels at 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s008">Figure S8C</xref>). Because running wheel and sensorimotor deficits may begin at 4 mo in the 140CAG HD mice with climbing deficits detected at 1.5 mo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Hickey1">[24]</xref>, this observation suggested that Ryk might be increased prior to the onset or during the early phases of motor decline in these mice.</p>
<p>We next explored striatal Ryk expression in HD brains. Human HD brain tissue specimens were age-matched and postmortem interval-matched. Densitometric analysis of Ryk showed a significant increase of immunofluorescence in grade 1/2 HD patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). In contrast to large cholinergic neurons and medium-sized NADPH-diaphorase aspiny neurons, medium-sized spiny GABAergic projection neurons of the HD striatum are affected early and most severely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Hersch1">[37]</xref>. To further explore Ryk immunoreactivity within the striatum of HD patients, we performed double immunofluorescence for Ryk in combination with either calbindin or NOS immunoreactivities, labeling degenerating and relatively unaffected striatal neurons, respectively. Ryk co-localized with calbindin-positive striatal neurons, with no cross-reactivity with spared NOS-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s009">Figure S9B</xref>), suggesting that Ryk immunoreactivity might correlate with the selective neuronal loss observed in HD. Additionally, we tested whether Ryk immunoreactivity might correlate with HD severity. Little positive Ryk immunoreactivity was present in the control specimens, with marked expression of Ryk immunoreactivity in all HD tissue samples in neurons, neuropil, and other cell types with increased degrees of neuropathological severity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s009">Figure S9C</xref>). Densitometric analysis showed grade-dependent increases in Ryk immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s009">Figure S9C</xref>). Finally, we used combined Ryk GFAP immunofluorescence to test whether Ryk might be increased in cells other than neurons for the most severe HD grade (grade 4), in which few medium spiny neurons are left in the caudate nucleus. Compared with age-matched normal specimens, Ryk immunofluorescence was increased within astroglia from caudate nucleus grade 4 HD, but not on a one-to-one basis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Although Ryk immunofluorescence signals were observed in the GFAP-negative area, and although there were glial figures without co-localized Ryk, Ryk immunoreactivity appeared to be predominantly from astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s010">Figure S10</xref>), a possibility also suggested by the densitometric analysis of Ryk immunoreactivity in mouse striata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s008">Figure S8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results suggested that Ryk may have discrete patterns of increased expression in striata and caudate nuclei, an aspect that will the subject of future studies that include additional Ryk antibodies and brain samples.</p>

<p>Wnt signaling regulates several developmental processes, including synaptic differentiation, as well as adult neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Inestrosa1">[11]</xref>.

Studies of polyglutamine expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker1">[7]</xref> and Aβ toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Cohen1">[8]</xref> indicates that the same applies to the activation of the FOXO pathway, a pathway that is central to cell survival/longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Landis1">[38]</xref> as well as neuronal cell homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Renault1">[39]</xref>. Here, we found that Ryk, a Wnt receptor important to axon guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Liu1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Bovolenta1">[41]</xref>, is increased in mutant polyQ neurons and represses FOXO neuroprotective activity, highlighting a pathological situation in which the Wnt and FOXO pathways interact to promote neuron dysfunction and degeneration. The Ryk protein is involved in canonical Wnt to regulate neurite outgrowth, being required for TCF-driven transcription through binding to Frizzled and Dishevelled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lu1">[26]</xref>. This raised the possibility that Ryk might repress FOXO activity via the alteration of the canonical Wnt/Fzd–β-catenin pathway. However, Wnt ligands such as <italic>cwn-1</italic>/WNT4, <italic>cwn-2/</italic>WNT5, and <italic>egl-20/</italic>WNT16 and the transcription factor <italic>pop-1</italic>/TCF did not appear to modulate 128Q neurotoxicity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that canonical Ryk signaling may not contribute to the toxicity of Ryk in mutant polyQ neurons. Besides its ability to signal through the planar cell polarity pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Macheda1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Andre1">[20]</xref>, the Ryk protein can also signal through another noncanonical pathway, namely the nuclear translocation of its ICD (Ryk-ICD), a γ-secretase cleavage product that is required for cortical neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lyu1">[16]</xref>. Here, we provide a model in which the repression of FOXO by Ryk in mutant polyQ neurons may primarily occur through the nuclear translocation of the Ryk-ICD fragment. Our data noticeably indicate that (<italic>i</italic>) the free Ryk-ICD fragment may be sufficient to repress FOXO activity in mutant polyQ cells, (<italic>ii</italic>) the <italic>lin-18</italic>/Ryk ICD fragment is sufficient to suppress the protective effects of <italic>lin-18</italic> knock-out on the function of polyQ-expanded nematode neurons, and (<italic>iii</italic>) the free Ryk-ICD fragment may bind to β-catenin, and there is a functional cross-talk between Ryk-ICD and β-catenin in the modulation of Ryk-ICD cytotoxicity. These data support the possibility that abnormally high amounts of Ryk-ICD may prevent the activity of β-catenin, a survival protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Essers1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Gines1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Zhang1">[42]</xref> that promotes FOXO transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Essers1">[9]</xref> and protects against the early phases of mutant polyQ cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker2">[10]</xref>. This model is further supported by our data linking Ryk and γ-secretase PS1 in the modulation of mutant htt striatal cell viability, and by our data on the increase of endogenous Ryk-ICD levels in the nucleus of these cells. Collectively, these observations point to the Ryk-ICD fragment as an important mediator of the detrimental effects of Ryk increase. The γ-secretase complex is involved in the role of Ryk in cortical neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lyu1">[16]</xref> and has been previously implicated in HD through its effect on HTT proteolysis and production of N-terminal HTT species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Kegel1">[36]</xref>. Our data suggest that γ-secretases may also have a role in the regulation of cell stress response in HD by mediating the detrimental effects of Ryk increase on FOXO3a activity. Here, it is noticeable that <italic>aph-1</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of APH-1B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Francis1">[43]</xref>, may be up-regulated by expanded polyQs, as suggested by our microarray data from touch receptor cells, which might further contribute to the toxicity of the Ryk-ICD pathway in mutant polyQ cells. Future research will build on these observations to further investigate the mechanisms that may underlie the pathological role of the Ryk-ICD/FOXO3a pathway in HD. Besides testing whether Ryk cytotoxicity might be modulated by mammalian Wnt ligands or Ryk inhibitory antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref> and studying whether an excess of the Ryk-ICD fragment might tether β-catenin away from FOXO, it will be interesting to identify the FOXO3a transcriptional targets that may be deregulated by Ryk in mutant polyQ neurons and understand how this may impact brain longevity mechanisms as the pathogenic process develops in HD. The type and activity of FOXO target genes may greatly depend on the cellular context in which FOXO operates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Neri1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Webb1">[44]</xref>, which may also be true in HD, as suggested by the study of context dependence in FOXO interaction networks across mouse and human datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Lejeune1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, the transcriptomic signature of 128Q nematode touch receptor cells contains 84 genes that were previously identified as putative <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO targets in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including 31 genes that are highly conserved in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s017">Table S7</xref>), suggesting that FOXO target genes may be altered by mutant polyQ expression. The deregulation status of most of these 31 genes appeared to be greatly context-dependent, as evaluated by using entropy-based feature selection across 14 HD-associated conditions including murine striatum and human (postmortem brains, blood samples, induced pluripotent stem cells) datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s017">Table S7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parmentier1">[5]</xref>, which emphasizes the importance of context (e.g., cell type, time requirement) in future analyses of the physiological impact of abnormal Ryk signaling on FOXO activity in HD.</p>
<p><italic>Lin-18</italic>/Ryk is up-regulated in 128Q nematode touch cells before the loss of touch response—that is, prior to pathology in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In the neostriatum of 140CAG mice, Ryk increase is first detected during the early phases of pathology in these mice, which further links increased expression of Ryk with the early phases of HD pathology. The alteration of Ryk may also be associated with the human disease, as suggested by the grade-dependent increase of Ryk immunoreactivity in the human HD caudate nucleus. However, although the increase of Ryk detected in the neostriatum of 140CAG mice is unlikely to result from abnormal Ryk degradation or age-dependent accumulation of Ryk as it was observed in young mice, Ryk immunoreactivity in postmortem HD brains might be influenced by several factors such as alteration of cyto-architectural structure and disease-unrelated factors. Similarly to other membrane proteins, Ryk might be processed by several proteases that cleave Ryk in the vicinity of its transmembrane domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref>, which might generate Ryk C-terminal and N-terminal fragments with distinct localization and half-life in brain tissues. Selective Ryk antibodies such as inhibitory anti-Ryk antibody RWD1 were recently described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Halford1">[33]</xref>, and these antibodies will be useful in additional studies of Ryk expression in the HD mouse and human HD brain.</p>
<p>The Ryk protein is solely represented in several genomes, and reducing its pathological levels is anticipated to ameliorate neurological disease, which makes this receptor an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention. Ryk is acutely induced in models of CNS injury and in concert with Wnt signaling proteins inhibits axon regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Li1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Liu2">[46]</xref>, suggesting that Ryk inhibition may promote axon regeneration upon injury. Our findings identify the inhibition of Ryk-ICD signaling as a therapeutic strategy to restore cell stress response and neuronal function in HD and perhaps in other neurodegenerative diseases. The up-regulation of Ryk prior to pathology in 128Q nematodes, the up-regulation of Ryk at the mRNA and protein levels in mutant htt striatal cells derived from HdhQ111 mice, and the converging evidence for nuclear Ryk-ICD to mediate Ryk neurotoxicity by altering FOXO activity suggest that the inhibition of the Ryk-ICD pathway may have therapeutic potential in HD.</p>
<p>In summary, our study reveals that Ryk activity is altered in mutant polyQ neurons, with Ryk up-regulation promoting neuronal dysfunction via the early-stage repression of FOXO neuroprotective activity. Regardless of a possible contribution from other mechanisms, our findings support a model in which the ICD of Ryk, a γ-secretase cleavage product, may be important for the neurotoxic action of Ryk increase by altering the protective activity of the β-catenin/FOXO complex. These data highlight a pathological process in which neurodevelopmental pathways may be altered during the early stages of the pathogenic process in neurodegenerative disease to repress cell stress response and “neuronal longevity” mechanisms such as those controlled by FOXO and its co-factors. Importantly, our data reveal that neurons may be unable to develop an efficient FOXO-mediated survival response against the earliest stages of mutant HTT toxicity. This suggests that the early-stage restoration of neuronal resistance capacity through the stimulation of cell-stress response networks and mechanisms that are under FOXO control might efficiently delay the pathogenic process in HD, which may have significant implications for the prioritization of disease-modifying strategies and identification of disease modifiers.</p>

<p>Nematode strains were handled using standard methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Brenner1">[47]</xref>.

Some nematode strains used in this work were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources. The complete list of strains used in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001895.s018">Table S8</xref>. Constructs encoding LIN-18 were generated as follows. The <italic>lin-18</italic> cDNA was obtained from wild-type animals by RT-PCR, using lin-18_attB5 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATACAAAAGTTGATGTTCATCAGCAAAGAGGA</named-content>) and lin-18_attB2 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTATTAGATGTATTGACTGAGT</named-content>) primers. These primers contain, respectively, attB5 and attB2 sequences for recombination in the pDONR221-P5-P2 vector, using the Gateway system (Invitrogen).

To produce the construct coding for the LIN-18 ICD, we used the same strategy. Briefly, we used as a reverse primer lin-18_attB2, and a forward primer located after the sequence that encodes LIN-18 ICD, RV61 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATACAAAAGTTGAAAATGTTCAAGCGCTCTAAAAAAGAAGA</named-content>).

We isolated at least two independent strains from each construct based on GFP expression in the pharynx to perform touch assays and axonal swelling assays. Touch response assays were carried out as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker1">[7]</xref>. Touch tests involved scoring for the response to light touch at the tail by using a fine hair. Touch test were performed by scoring 10 touches at the tail of the animal for a minimum of 200 animals per genotype. Ordinarily, wild-type animals will respond by backing away from the touch. The responses were recorded for every animal such that, for example, 3 responses out of 10 at the tail is given as 30% responsiveness, and the mean values for responsiveness were retained for comparison of nematode groups. Touch tests were performed by two groups of two experimenters, and maximum baseline variation was 9%. Axonal swelling was scored as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Parker1">[7]</xref>. Briefly, 128Q nematodes were mounted on agar pads and immobilized using levamisole 20 mM, prior to examination on a 40× objective of a Leica Axioplan microscope, equipped with fluorescence. A total of more than 150 animals per strain were examined for axonal swelling in PLM neurons. Animals containing at least one swollen axon were scored as positive. For strains expressing extrachromosomal arrays, only animals expressing the transgenic marker (i.e., GFP expressed in the pharynx under the control of <italic>myo-2p</italic>) were assayed. Extraction of protein from whole worms and Western blotting was conducted using standard methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Duerr1">[50]</xref> and the following primary antibodies: GFP antiserum (Abcam, 1∶5,000) and actin antibody (Molecular Probes, 1∶5,000).

The siRNAs (si-Ryk, si-Foxo3a) and scramble RNAs were obtained from QIAGEN and Operon, respectively. Mixes of 3–4 different siRNA sequences per gene (each sequence at 25 or 33 nM) were systematically tested for modulation of cell survival and target gene expression, followed by the evaluation of individual siRNA sequences at optimal concentration (100 nM). Effects on cell survival were considered to be reliable if two different siRNAs showed similar effects on target expression and cell survival and if the scramble RNAs (100 nM; unique sequence that does match with any sequence in the mouse genome) did not show any effect. The active siRNA sequences shown in the figures are as follows: si-Ryk, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCAAATTAGTAGAAGCCAA-3′</named-content> (100 nM); si-Foxo3a, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCTTCATGCGCGTTCAGAA-3′</named-content> (100 nM); siPS1, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGAGCATTCTAACGAGTGA-3′</named-content> (100 nM); and siPS2, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTATCAAGTCTGTGCGTTT-3′</named-content> (100 nM).

<p>Cell mortality assays were performed as described previously by counting picnotic nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Gauthier1">[52]</xref> or measuring caspase 3/7 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001895-Miller1">[53]</xref>. Briefly, low passage number (P9–P12) 7Q/7Q and 109Q/109Q cells were subjected to a 24-h serum deprivation 48 h after cell transfection. Cells were then fixed and subjected to DAPI staining, and cell mortality was scored by counting picnotic versus normal nuclei in DAPI- and jetPEI-FluoR–, or JetSI-ENDO–positive cells. Alternatively, caspase assays were used and transfected cells were plated on collagen-coated 96-well plates for 48 h. After 24-h serum starvation, the activation of caspase 3/7 was measured in cells using the Apo 3/7 HTS High Throughput Screen Assay kit (Cell Technology).
