<abstract>
<p>Central mechanisms by which specific motor programs are selected to achieve meaningful behaviors are not well understood. Using electrophysiological recordings from pharyngeal nerves upon central activation of neurotransmitter-expressing cells, we show that distinct neuronal ensembles can regulate different feeding motor programs. In behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, activation of 20 neurons in the brain expressing the neuropeptide hugin, a homolog of mammalian neuromedin U, simultaneously suppressed the motor program for food intake while inducing the motor program for locomotion. Decreasing hugin neuropeptide levels in the neurons by RNAi prevented this action. Reducing the level of hugin neuronal activity alone did not have any effect on feeding or locomotion motor programs. Furthermore, use of promoter-specific constructs that labeled subsets of hugin neurons demonstrated that initiation of locomotion can be separated from modulation of its motor pattern. These results provide insights into a neural mechanism of how opposing motor programs can be selected in order to coordinate feeding and locomotive behaviors.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In the animal kingdom, two of the most essential behaviors are locomotion and feeding. The motor programs underlying these behaviors are controlled by higher-order circuits in the central nervous system. However, how an organism selects a particular motor program based on inputs from the information-processing higher brain centers to generate an adaptable behavior is not well understood. Here, we analyze the behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae after activating a small cluster of neurons in the brain and show that the animals simultaneously stop eating and start moving. These neurons express the neuropeptide hugin, which is homologous to the mammalian neuromedins. We show that the reduction of food intake depends on hugin and that the cluster of hugin neurons is functionally divided into distinct subgroups that both accelerate the motor program for locomotion and decelerate the motor program for feeding. We propose that hugin neurons represent a control system between the higher brain circuits that process information and those that execute motor programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recruitment of appropriate motor programs to changing environmental conditions is an essential aspect of animal behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Grillner1">[1]</xref>. The nervous system of invertebrates and vertebrates includes a broad variety of motor programs with neuronal circuits having the intrinsic property to generate rhythmic motor output, termed central pattern generators (CPGs). These motor programs underlie the spatial and temporal activation of specific muscle groups that characterize movements like chewing, swallowing, walking, breathing, and locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Delcomyn1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-HarrisWarwick1">[3]</xref>. The mechanisms by which a specific motor program is selected from a repertoire of potential motor programs are not well understood.</p>
<p>In vertebrates, the motor system for locomotion has been extensively studied with various methods including pharmacological, electrophysiological, and more recently genetic tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Grillner2">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Bschges1">[9]</xref>. Isolated spinal cord preparations have been used to demonstrate the existence of locomotive CPGs in the mammalian spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Kiehn2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Whelan1">[11]</xref>. The neural networks comprising the motor programs and the motor neurons for the single limbs are located in the spinal cord, and the motor network of a limb can be divided into motor subprograms and sets of motor neurons for each joint of a limb. These spinal–cortical networks are activated via reticulospinal neurons by command centers in the mesencephalon and diencephalon, which in turn are controlled by neuronal structures in basal ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Grillner1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Takakusaki1">[12]</xref>. Neurotransmitters such as serotonin, for example, have been shown to be necessary to induce motor patterns in isolated brainstem–spinal preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Cazalets1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Jiang1">[14]</xref>. Specific neurotransmitter-expressing cells that are involved in regulating the speed of locomotion have also been identified by genetic tools in lamprey, zebrafish, and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Gosgnach1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Zagoraiou1">[19]</xref>. Currently, little is known about the cellular circuits in the brainstem or descending cortical pathways which regulate the locomotion CPGs in the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Miri1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the highly conserved locomotor motor behaviors, those related to feeding are critical for growth and survival. These encompass movements involving the whole body for searching and getting access to food sources, local parts of the body for actual food intake, as well as organ-specific movements for post-ingestive phases of feeding. In invertebrates, the rhythmic nature of swallowing and food transport has been utilized as a model to study the structure of CPGs that generate oscillating motor patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-HarrisWarwick1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Marder1">[21]</xref>, as well as providing insights into the physiological parameters that drive feeding behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Hirayama1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Taghert1">[25]</xref>. This has also been the case in mammalian systems, where the discovery of leptin provided a major nucleation point for analyzing how peripheral signals influence central circuits that regulate food intake behavior and energy homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Belgardt1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Oury1">[27]</xref>. Simpler genetic systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are increasingly being used to study the genes and neural circuits that control feeding and feeding-related processes. These studies include the identification of the first gene involved in food search behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Sokolowski1">[28]</xref>, metabolic genes that influence feeding, as well as numerous neuropeptide- and neurotransmitter-encoding genes, to name a few <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Avery1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Avery3">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have, to date, focused mostly on analyzing feeding behavior in response to chemosensory or metabolic cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Buch1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Mann1">[39]</xref>.These studies have used sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate specific neuronal populations in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Olsen1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Simpson1">[41]</xref>, but what has lagged behind is a high resolution readout of such manipulations on motor programs. Most have used behavioral paradigms as readout assays, for example extension of the proboscis towards a food source, measurement of food ingested, the direction a fly takes in two-choice food assays. Although providing valuable information, these approaches determine the summation of many motor programs, and it is difficult to deconstruct the distinct motor programs that produce the observed behavioral output. In addition, most of the feeding behavior assays are performed in response to sensory stimuli, and it is not possible to distinguish which step in the sensorimotor pathway is primarily being affected. Thus, it is not surprising that, in comparison with chemosensory circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Scott1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Su1">[44]</xref>, much less is known about the motor circuits that underlie feeding behavior.</p>
<p>Recently, an electrophysiological approach was used in semi-intact preparations to monitor the rhythmic motor patterns that comprise the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval feeding cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Schoofs1">[45]</xref>. These analyses led to the identification of three motor patterns derived from three distinct nerves that innervate the feeding apparatus and which together comprise larval feeding behavior: motor output of antennal nerve (AN) results in pharyngeal pumping, motor output of maxillary nerve (MN) drives mouth hook movements, and that of prothoracic accessory nerve (PaN) causes head tilting movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Schoofs1">[45]</xref>. In addition to providing higher resolution dissection of feeding motor patterns, this approach also overcomes an important issue relevant for studying motor circuits in general: it eliminates external inputs provided by a wide variety of sensory organs, as well as by internal peripheral tissues that can affect feeding responses, such as the gut, fat body, or the oenocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-SarovBlat1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Gutierrez1">[48]</xref>. The approach provides an opportunity to combine molecular genetics with electrophysiology in order to study how the central nervous system (CNS) selects and executes motor programs.</p>
<p>In this study, we used behavioral, genetic, imaging, and electrophysiological approaches to study central mechanisms that modulate feeding-related behaviors. We first identified neurotransmitter and neuropeptide clusters that modulate subsets of motor programs for feeding. This revealed that a small neuronal cluster can oppositely regulate feeding and locomotive motor programs. The cells of this cluster express the gene <italic>hugin</italic>, which encodes a neuropeptide homolog to mammalian neuromedin U and which was previously proposed as being involved in food intake and food search behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Melcher1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Melcher2">[49]</xref>. Increased neuromedin U signaling in mammals has been shown to suppress feeding and increase locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Nakazato1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Nixon1">[51]</xref>. We show here that activation of hugin neurons suppresses the motor program for feeding and simultaneously initiates the motor program for locomotion. Our results provide a model for how selection of coordinately regulated motor programs can be brought about through activation of a single cluster of neurons in the brain.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological Analysis of Central Neurons that Alter Feeding Motor Patterns</title>
<p>We previously characterized the major muscles and the nerves driving the movements that underlie feeding behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Schoofs1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Zinke1">[47]</xref>: AN, MN, and the PaN (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Our next goal in characterizing the feeding motor system was to identify central components of the motor hierarchy that could modulate the motor pattern recorded from the three pharyngeal nerves. The strategy was to activate specific neurotransmitter- and neuropeptide-expressing neurons in an inducible manner, and assay their effect on motor programs of feeding-related behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Directing the expression of the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTrpA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Hamada1">[52]</xref> via the Gal4-UAS system enabled us to characterize the effect of activating distinct neuronal populations in a temporally controlled manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We initially prescreened 11 lines, representing major neurotransmitter and selected neuropeptide lines, by a food intake assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s002">Figure S2</xref>); those that showed significant effect on food intake were taken for electrophysiological as well as additional feeding analysis. Five lines selected for this study were those labeling glutamatergic (Glu), cholinergic (ACh), serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA), and hugin (Hug) neurons. The effect of temperature-induced activation of neuronal populations on the motor patterns was then monitored with single extracellular recordings of the three pharyngeal nerves (AN, MN, and the PaN) to distinguish neuronal populations that would affect the feeding motor pattern either globally or as just a subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We then compared the changes in cycle frequency, which is a crucial feature of rhythmic behavior: classical studies on crustacean stomatogastric nervous systems revealed that all known modulatory inputs affect the cycle frequency of pyloric motor rhythm by altering the endogenous properties of at least one component of the CPG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-HarrisWarwick1">[3]</xref>.</p>

<p>Neuronal activation of the Glu population resulted in a reversible state of tonic excitation in the motor patterns of all three pharyngeal nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This was expected since the Gal-4 driver line (OK371) drives target gene expression in nearly all Glu neurons of the CNS that comprise the motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Mahr1">[53]</xref>. Activating the ACh neurons showed a significant increase in cycle frequency of all motor patterns; in some instances the pattern approached the tonic excitation seen for Glu neurons. Activation of 5-HT neurons also caused an increase in cycle frequency; the effect on the 5-HT neurons stood out because of the remarkable regularity of the accelerated motor pattern in all three pharyngeal nerves. By contrast, activation of DA and Hug neurons decreased rhythm frequency. Moreover, these showed differential effect on the feeding motor patterns: only the AN motor pattern was affected, and not the MN or the PaN. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicated that certain neuronal classes affected all, whereas others affected only a subset, of the feeding motor programs.</p>
<p>Food intake studies further confirmed the roles of these neurones in feeding behavior. A short-term yeast intake assay was used in order to minimize longer-acting peripheral influence on the feeding response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Four neuronal populations significantly decreased yeast intake: Glu, ACh, DA, and Hug neurons. Only one increased yeast intake: 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Contraction of the cibarial dilator muscles (CDM), which is due to the AN motor program, is the movement most dedicated to food intake per se as compared to those driven by MN or PaN motor programs. Contractions of CDM presumably generate a negative pressure, resulting in ingestion of liquidized food: ‘pharyngeal pumping’. Thus, we also performed video-based monitoring of the CDM contractions in semi-intact larvae to see how this particular movement could be correlated with the electrophysiology and food intake data (CDM tracking, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). There is indeed a good correlation between the CDM contraction pattern and the AN recordings, which may explain the food intake results. For Glu, the tonic-like excitation resulted in convulsive contractions of the CDM, leading to essentially no food intake. For ACh, the CDM relaxed incompletely between successive contractions, causing less effective pharyngeal pumping, which likely accounts for the decreased food intake despite increased pumping rate. For DA and Hug, the frequency of the contraction was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g002">Figure 2B</xref>); the effect was more drastic for Hug, as seen by the strength of each contraction. The decreased food intake in both cases is as expected. For 5-HT, there was a rapid increase in the rate of CDM contractions, consistent with the increase in AN recording cycle frequency and food intake.</p>

<title>Effect on yeast intake and CDM contractions by Gal4-directed dTrpA1-mediated activation of neuronal networks.</title>
<p>(A) Experimental setup: yeast intake of larvae (% of body stained) was determined after 20 min of dTrpA1 activation (upper picture). All tested Gal4-lines showed a decreased relative change in yeast intake except 5-HT (TRH-Gal4) line, which showed an increase (lower panel; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: ***p≤0.001). (B) CDM contractions were tracked by measuring the length difference of pharyngeal lumen (Δd) at 32°C relative to the maximal contractions at 18°C (upper picture). Tracking of the CDM contractions correspond to deduced muscle activity based on the AN recordings (lower left panel). CDM contractions were quantified as relative change in contractions/min (lower right panel).

<p>The combined electrophysiological and behavioral analyses opened up several avenues to pursue, as all the lines revealed interesting features relating to selection and modulation of motor patterns. For example, the unique finding that the serotonergic line, when activated, was the only one of 11 lines tested which resulted in increased food intake. The dopaminergic and hugin lines were interesting since they affected only a subset of the motor programs (i.e., the AN, but not MN or PaN motor programs), thus demonstrating a specificity in recruitment of different motor programs that comprise the feeding system. For the current study, we decided to focus on the hugin neuronal cluster for one critical reason, namely the relative simplicity of the expression pattern generated by the HugS3-Gal4 line in both numerical and spatial terms. Previous studies showed that this line drives reporter gene expression precisely in 20 cells, all tightly clustered in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Melcher2">[49]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and send projections to the ventral nerve cord and the protocerebrum, which is the higher brain center.</p>

<title>Activation of Neurons Expressing Hugin Neuropeptide Suppresses Feeding and Increases Wandering-like Behavior</title>
<p>We first wanted to verify the effect of hugin on the feeding motor system using an independent method to activate neurons. Thus, we used NaChBac and recorded the AN motor pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Luan1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Nitabach1">[55]</xref>. The recordings showed a significant suppression of AN motor activity, further strengthening the view that hugin neurons suppress feeding motor patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We also wanted to perform the converse experiment by inhibiting hugin neuronal activity through the use of temperature-sensitive shibire (shibire<sup>ts</sup>), which blocks synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Kitamoto1">[56]</xref>. However, we did not observe any difference in the frequency of the AN motor pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). This indicated that activating hugin neurons suppresses AN motor activity, but inhibiting them does not increase it. We do not think this is due to the normal larval feeding motor system operating at a maximal level (since larvae are continuous feeders), since we can in fact observe an increase in motor activity when serotonergic neurons are activated. Instead, we believe that this reveals insights into the mechanism by which hugin neurons function in modulating the feeding motor system (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). Consistent with this view, ablating the hugin cells (by expressing reaper-hid to induce apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Buch2">[57]</xref>) or inhibiting the neuronal activity using Kir2.1 also had no effect on the AN motor pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we next wanted to analyze the alterations in feeding behavior when hugin neurons were activated in more detail. Specifically, we wanted to determine if the suppressed food intake was accompanied by alterations in a food-related locomotory behavior, namely the wandering-like behavior. This is a behavior that is observed in certain mutant larvae which are defective in food intake, where they move away from the food source and wander about the surrounding area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Zinke1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Melcher2">[49]</xref>. Indeed, in addition to suppression of food intake, a significant wandering-like behavior is also observed when hugin neurons are activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to the alteration in locomotive behavior, we next asked if the activity of the abdominal segmental muscles that underlie locomotion were affected by activating the hugin neurons. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junctions of the ventral longitudinal muscle (M6 and M7) are well established and have provided valuable insight into synapse function and muscle membrane excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Ataman1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Jan1">[59]</xref>. The rhythmic motor outputs recorded from abdominal muscle M6 are representative for locomotory patterns generated by the larval CNS and likely reflect crawling behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Cattaert1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Barclay1">[61]</xref>. We therefore monitored the activity of the abdominal muscle M6 by intracellular recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed an accelerating effect on abdominal muscle contraction pattern upon activation of the hugin neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g004">Figure 4B–D</xref>). We note at this point that we also recorded the M6 muscle motor pattern when shibire<sup>ts</sup> was used to silence hugin neurons, but as with the pharyngeal motor pattern above, no effect was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).</p>

<p>We then asked if pharyngeal pumping and abdominal activity could be coordinately regulated. Therefore, we performed double intracellular recordings of the CDM and the abdominal muscle M6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Remarkably, hugin neuron activation resulted in a concomitant decrease in feeding and increase in locomotion motor program: the post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) of CDM are completely suppressed, whereas those of abdominal muscle (M6) persist and the motor pattern increased in cycle frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g004">Figure 4F–H</xref>). In wild type situations, an increase in temperature results in the usually observed temperature effect where both activities are increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). It is well established that temperature has a profound effect on intrinsic network properties that influence the setting of rhythm frequencies in the CNS of invertebrates and vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Calabrese1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Marder2">[63]</xref>. In HugS3&gt;dTrpA1, the increased abdominal motor activity is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in CDM motor activity. These results indicated that hugin neurons can modulate two opposite motor programs simultaneously: the feeding program and the locomotory program. Consistent with the previous results, shibire<sup>ts</sup> also had no effect on the CDM motor pattern recordings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s005">Figure S5A</xref>) and the underlying feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Hugin Neuropeptide Is Required to Suppress the Feeding Motor Program</title>
<p>Since the results described above indicated that activation of the hugin neurons leads to suppression of feeding, we next wanted to determine if the hugin neuropeptide is required for this suppression. The strategy was to decrease hugin neuropeptide levels in the hugin neurons through RNA interference (RNAi) and see if activating the hugin neurons would still result in suppression of feeding behavior. First we determined the effectiveness of several RNAi lines to decrease hugin neuropeptide levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

LacZRNAi serves as control RNAi construct. (B) Analysis of AN motor pattern was quantified as relative change in cycle frequency (upper panel). Recordings revealed that HugS3&gt;dTrpA1,HugRNAi1A showed a complete, and HugS3&gt;dTrpA1,TRiP.JF03122 a partial, rescue by the RNAi on the motor output most dedicated to food ingestion. Analysis of M6 muscle recording results (lower panel) is presented as relative change in cycle frequency). HugS3&gt;dTrpA1,HugRNAi1A and HugS3&gt;dTrpA1,TRiP.JF03122 showed a significant difference compared with the control and no significant difference to the HugS3&gt;dTrpA1. In contrast to AN motor pattern and wandering-like behavior, the effect of HugS3&gt;dTrpA1 on motor pattern of muscle M6 could not be rescued by the knock down of the hugin neuropeptide (see text for <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref>, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: n.s., nonsignificant; ***p≤0.001). (C) Analysis of food intake behavior (upper panel). Results are presented as relative change in yeast intake. HugS3&gt;dTrpA1,HugRNAi1A and HugS3&gt;dTrpA1,TRiP.JF03122 showed a significant difference to control and HugS3&gt;dTrpA1, indicating partial rescue by two independent RNAi constructs.

Knock down of hugin neuropeptide in the two <italic>hugin</italic> RNAi harboring animals prevented induction of wandering-like behavior; the effect is similar to Control (OrgR, OrgR x dTrpA1), and significantly different to HugS3&gt;dTrpA1,lacZRNAi (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: n.s., nonsignificant; ***p≤0.001).</p>

<p>Animals which only expressed the <italic>hugin</italic> RNAi gene construct did not show any alterations in the feeding phenotype, in line with the results, described in the previous section, showing that inhibiting or ablating hugin neurons also had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s005">Figure S5</xref>). However, if hugin neurons were activated with dTrpA1 in animals expressing the HugRNAi construct, the suppression of AN motor pattern was no longer observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, top panel). Similar results were observed with food intake and wandering-like behavior. In both cases, the HugRNAi lines significantly prevented the hugin neurons from exerting their suppressive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the increase in cycle frequency of M6 motor pattern was not affected—that is, activating the hugin neurons still resulted in increased cycle frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom panel). Thus, the induction of wandering-like behavior can be decoupled from modulation of the locomotory motor program. Taken together, these results show that hugin neuropeptide is required for modulating food intake but not for the locomotion motor program; it is also required for initiating wandering-like behavior.</p>

<title>Distinct Cells of the Hugin Cluster Modulate Speed of Abdominal Muscle Contraction</title>
<p>The hugin neuronal cluster comprises just 20 cells, whose soma are all located in the SOG. Earlier work showed that the hugin neurons form four distinct subclasses, each having different projection targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Melcher1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Melcher2">[49]</xref>. One subclass sends projections down the entire length of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Bader1">[64]</xref>, suggesting a possible role in locomotion. To explore this, we made several deletion constructs of the hugin cis-regulatory region in order to see if the different subclasses were under the control of separable enhancers. In one construct (Hug0.8) there was a complete absence of expression in the four hugin cells that project to the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g006">Figure 6A–C; G</xref>), whereas the other 16 neurons were present. Furthermore, using this promoter element in cell ablation experiments resulted in the loss of the 16 cells, whereas the four hugin VNC neurons remained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s008">Figure S8</xref>), demonstrating the specificity of this promoter element. To analyze the behavioral consequence, we carried out both food-intake and wandering-like locomotion assays. The 16-cell construct (Hug0.8), in which the VNC projections were missing, could still suppress food ingestion as well as induce wandering-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g006">Figure 6H,I</xref>).</p>

<p>We then performed the converse experiment: to determine the function of the 4-cell hugin cluster that projects to the VNC. We therefore made a promoter construct from a region that was deleted in Hug0.8 construct relative to the HugS3 construct. This line drove target gene expression in precisely the four hugin cells that project down the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g006">Figure 6D–F, G</xref>). dTrpA1 activation of this 4-cell VNC cluster had no effect on food intake or wandering-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g006">Figure 6 H,I</xref>).</p>
<p>Next we measured cycle frequency of the AN motor pattern after dTrpA1 activation of these two nonoverlapping neuronal clusters.

However, when M6 abdominal muscle recordings were performed, we observed the acceleration of the motor pattern with the 4-cell element but not with the 16-cell element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g007">Figure 7D–F</xref>).

<p>Taken together, these results indicated that food intake (motor program for pharyngeal pumping) and initiation of wandering-like behavior can be decoupled from modulation of the speed of abdominal muscle contraction. The 4-cell hugin VNC cluster can thus regulate locomotion speed separately from pharyngeal pumping. Therefore, although activation of the entire 20-cell hugin cluster coordinately suppresses feeding and enhances locomotion speed, the two motor programs are under the control of distinct hugin neuronal subclasses. Both the suppression of food intake and the induction of wandering-like behavior are performed by the 16-cell cluster, whereas the 4-cell VNC cluster is required to increase the cycle frequency of the locomotor motor pattern.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>Action Selection of Motor Programs for Different Behavioral Modules</title>
<p>Behavioral modules can be seen to be composed of distinct motor programs that are differentially recruited based on adaptive needs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Grillner1">[1]</xref>. These can be cooperative or antagonistic, and the right combinations must be selected in order to bring about the required behavior. For feeding, this requires motor programs that allow actual ingestion of food as well as those locomotor programs involved in food search or food avoidance behaviors. This implies that animals must distinguish motor programs that run serially or in parallel, and those that are essentially mutually exclusive. In humans for example, feeding normally requires arm movements to bring the food to the mouth, followed by biting and chewing, and finally swallowing; but the act of swallowing can occur in the absence of the earlier movements; conversely, similar arm movements to those made during eating can be observed during running. Within a given motor program there are additional levels of modulation—for example, the speed with which a given movement is made.</p>
<p>The behavioral module that comprises <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval feeding is also composed of distinct motor programs, as shown by motor patterns of three pharyngeal nerves, the AN, MN, and the PaN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Schoofs1">[45]</xref>. Our electrophysiology screen reveals distinct populations of central neurons that can regulate motor patterns in a different manner. Some, such as serotonergic neurons, affect all three motor programs; others, like hugin neurons, act on a subset. These differences can be viewed as having varying degrees of functional overlap. Pharyngeal pumping (due to the AN motor program) is the movement most dedicated to food intake; at the other end of the functional spectrum, the segmental longitudinal muscle contractions would be most dedicated to locomotion. Mouth hook and head tilt movements (due to MN and PaN motor programs, respectively) are likely involved in both feeding and locomotion. These motor programs can be separately regulated and recruited for different behavioral modules. Such mechanisms have been demonstrated at the CPG level in other invertebrates, where the same neurons can be used in different CPGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Marder1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Kristan1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>For both feeding and locomotion, the cellular identities of the CPGs remain largely unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of feeding CPG(s) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Schoofs1">[45]</xref>. We have now localized one of these, the AN motor pattern underlying pharyngeal pumping, to the SOG by lesion experiments. Spieß et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Spie1">[66]</xref> has provided evidence that the motor neurons of the AN are also located in the SOG. Although the lesioning of VNC or brain hemisphere can still generate a rhythmic motor pattern, it is not identical to that generated when both are present, indicating that inputs from the VNC and brain hemispheres have a modulatory effect on the pharyngeal pumping CPG. Our results on feeding are complementary to earlier findings on the motor program for locomotion. Forward crawling of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is composed of repetitive wave-like contractions of the segmental body wall musculature from posterior to anterior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Lahiri1">[67]</xref>. Several studies indicated that the neural networks of the crawling motor program (CPGs for crawling) are located in the thoracic and abdominal segments of the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Cattaert1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Berni1">[68]</xref>, and genetic manipulations showed that the brain hemispheres and the SOG are not required to produce a rhythmic motor pattern in the VNC and crawling behavior, although the rhythmic motor pattern is required for directed movements in response to chemosensory cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Berni1">[68]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this context, a major issue is that of cellular specificity: which of the cells targeted by these neurotransmitter Gal4 lines are responsible for the observed effects on the feeding and locomotor program? For example, serotonin is expressed in about 84 cells in the larval CNS: ∼56 in the VNC, ∼8 in the SOG, and ∼20 in the protocerebrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Valls1">[69]</xref>. As mentioned above, the activation of the serotonergic cells results in an increased cycle frequency of all three motor programs; it also enhances the locomotion program in the VNC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001893.s009">Figure S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). However, we do not know which of the serotonergic cells contribute to which of these programs. In addition, different groups of serotonergic cells may have different, even opposite functions, and it may be that the promoting effect dominates when all groups become activated. The various sparse lines and intersectional strategies to narrow down the types of cells being manipulated will be valuable in addressing this issue. This can be combined with the ability to record, from isolated CNS, both feeding and locomotor motor patterns, permitting the identification of central neurons that coordinate the motor programs underlying different behavioral modules.</p>

Hugin neurons affect a subset (pharyngeal pumping), whereas serotonergic neurons affect all feeding motor patterns (head tilting, mouth hook movement, and pharyngeal pumping). Hugin neurons also regulate in an opposite manner the motor program for segmental contraction, whereas serotonergic neurons affect segmental contraction in the same manner as the feeding motor pattern.

<title>Neuropeptide Modulation of Mutually Exclusive Actions</title>
<p>A striking finding from our study is the fact that activating a small cluster of 20 neurons in the SOG, all expressing the neuropeptide hugin, leads to a simultaneous suppression of a motor program for feeding and induction of one for locomotion. This is observed both at the behavioral and electrophysiological level. Thus, the hugin cluster can regulate two essentially competing programs since larvae, as with most animals, do not feed and move at the same time. A notable feature of the hugin neuronal cluster is that we have not been able to observe any difference to the control situation when hugin neuronal activity is decreased. For both pharyngeal pumping and wandering-like behavior, it is only when the hugin neurons are activated that we see a modulatory effect. Similarly, the increase in the frequency of M6 abdominal muscle contraction is observed only under activation of hugin neurons. We believe these observations provide insights into the mechanism by which the hugin neurons act. This can be illustrated in terms of how a brake and gas pedal function to coordinate two mutually exclusive operations of a car. Activating hugin neurons decreases feeding, but inhibiting them does not increase feeding: applying a brake causes deceleration, but removing it does not cause acceleration. Similarly, activating the hugin neurons enhance abdominal muscle contraction, but their inhibition does not slow down contraction: stepping on the gas pedal increases speed, but taking it off does not actively decrease speed. This scenario can be used to explain the requirement of hugin neuropeptide in our RNAi experiments. Lowering the level of hugin neuropeptide in activated hugin neurons no longer affected the motor patterns underlying food intake and locomotion, indicating that hugin neuropeptide is necessary for the hugin neurons to suppress feeding and induce wandering-like behavior.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note that hugin neuropeptide does not seem to be required for speeding up the motor program for locomotion. This could be because of the residual quantity of hugin neuropeptide or to some compensation mechanism; more likely, the accelerating effect is due to a different neurotransmitter. At this point, we do not know which classical neurotransmitters are expressed in the hugin cells. In mammals, it has been shown that serotonergic and cholinergic systems influence the speed of motor neuron firing in the spinal cord that underlies locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Grillner4">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Kiehn2">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, our results show that modulation of the speed of locomotion motor program can be decoupled with the initiation of wandering-like behavior. The decision to both stop feeding and to move out of the food is mediated by a separate cluster of 16 hugin cells, eight of which project to the protocerebrum. A possible scenario is that the cells which adjust the speed of locomotion are recruited during or after the selection of motor programs for suppressing food intake and initiating wandering-like behavior.</p>

<title>Neural Substrate of Action Selection: the Protocerebrum–SOG Corridor</title>
<p>In many vertebrates, the center for swallowing is thought to be localized in the brainstem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Miller1">[70]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Bieger1">[72]</xref>. The cranial nerves that innervate muscles involved in chewing and swallowing descend from the brainstem. The neuronal components are much less understood relative to the spinal cord, although identifying the specific brain areas that regulate food intake is a focus of intense study in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Williams1">[73]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the larval SOG occupies a central position within the CNS to integrate information on feeding and locomotion, as it connects the VNC with the brain hemispheres. The pharyngeal nerves that innervate the feeding musculature originate from the SOG, and gustatory sensory neurons send projections to the SOG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Vosshall1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Schoofs1">[45]</xref>. The brainstem in vertebrates is analogously positioned, being located at the junction between the brain and the spinal cord, and the cranial nerves that innervate the pharynx originate from this part of the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Shepherd1">[74]</xref>, suggesting that the SOG could represent an analogous structure to the vertebrate brainstem.</p>
<p>It has recently been postulated that the insect central complex might play an analogous role to the basal ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Strausfeld1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Wessnitzer1">[77]</xref>. Although a canonical central complex has not yet been identified in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain, a functional analogue is probably located in the protocerebrum. The neuroanatomy of the hugin neurons, especially exemplified by the projection pattern that connects the SOG to the protocerebrum, suggests that the SOG/protocerebrum corridor encompassing the hugin neuronal projections may play an important role in action selection of motor programs underlying feeding and locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001893-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). The hugin projections to the protocerebrum and the connections to the gustatory cells and the insulin-producing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Melcher2">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Bader2">[78]</xref>, would process external and internal sensory cues, and determine which motor programs modulating feeding and locomotion are selected.</p>
<p>A major future challenge will be to determine how the different neuronal components of the feeding motor hierarchy are interconnected. One essential effort will be to analyze the receptor for the hugin neuropeptides. Two putative receptors have already been identified and it would be necessary to determine the cells that express the receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Rosenkilde1">[79]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Park1">[80]</xref>. Another effort will be to localize the classical neurotransmitters that may be expressed in the different hugin cells. Complementary to these would be to exploit the high-resolution connectivity mapping of the larval CNS that is currently being done through serial EM reconstructions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-Cardona1">[81]</xref>, as has been done in the classic work for <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001893-White1">[82]</xref>.

<p>For <italic>en passant</italic> extracellular recording, the nerve was insulated with a surrounding petroleum jelly border on a piece of Parafilm.

Motor output was measured by differential recordings of the deafferented nerve with a preamplifier connected to a four-channel amplifier/signal conditioner (Model MA 102/103; Ansgar Büschges group electronics lab). All recorded signals were amplified (amplification factor: 5000) and filtered (bandpass: 0.1–3 kHz). The recordings were sampled at 20 kHz.

<p>For intracellular muscle recordings, semi-intact CDM/M6 preparations of third instar larvae were used.

The dTrpA1-experiments revealed an endogenous temperature effect which could mask the impact of dTrpA1-activated GAL4-driver lines on the rhythmic motor output.
