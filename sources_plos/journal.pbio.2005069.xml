<article-title>Zinc: A small molecule with a big impact on sperm function</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Sperm activation is a fascinating example of cell differentiation, in which immotile spermatids undergo a rapid and dramatic transition to become mature, motile sperm. Because the sperm nucleus is transcriptionally silent, this transition does not involve transcriptional changes. Although <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a leading model for studies of sperm activation, the mechanisms by which signaling pathways induce this transformation remain poorly characterized. Here we show that a conserved transmembrane zinc transporter, ZIPT-7.1, regulates the induction of sperm activation in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes. The <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites cannot self-fertilize, and males reproduce poorly, because mutant spermatids are defective in responding to activating signals. The <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> gene is expressed in the germ line and functions in germ cells to promote sperm activation. When expressed in mammalian cells, ZIPT-7.1 mediates zinc transport with high specificity and is predominantly located on internal membranes. Finally, genetic epistasis places <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> at the end of the <italic>spe-8</italic> sperm activation pathway, and ZIPT-7.1 binds SPE-4, a presenilin that regulates sperm activation. Based on these results, we propose a new model for sperm activation. In spermatids, inactive ZIPT-7.1 is localized to the membranous organelles, which contain higher levels of zinc than the cytoplasm. When sperm activation is triggered, ZIPT-7.1 activity increases, releasing zinc from internal stores. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic zinc promotes the phenotypic changes characteristic of activation. Thus, zinc signaling is a key step in the signal transduction process that mediates sperm activation, and we have identified a zinc transporter that is central to this activation process.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Sperm are specialized cells with transcriptionally silent DNA that has been packaged for delivery into the egg. In their final step of development, immature sperm undergo a rapid transition from nonmotile cells to mature, motile sperm capable of fertilization. The signals that trigger this change are not clearly understood. By identifying mutants in the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that are defective in sperm activation, we discovered a conserved transmembrane protein, ZIPT-7.1, that transports zinc and promotes sperm activation in both sexes. ZIPT-7.1 is expressed in the germ line and functions there to control sperm activation. When expressed ectopically in mammalian cells, the protein specifically transports zinc across membranes and localizes primarily to membranes within the cell. Previous genetic studies had identified two pathways that mediate sperm activation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, and our results suggest that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> acts at the end of one of these two, the <italic>spe-8</italic> pathway. We propose that when this pathway triggers sperm activation, it acts through ZIPT-7.1, which mediates the release of zinc from internal stores in the immature sperm. This released zinc functions as a second messenger to promote the differentiation of mature, motile sperm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In animals, each differentiated cell type expresses a unique set of genes, resulting in the characteristic array of proteins that together confer its identity. These proteins equip the cell for the specific functions it needs to perform its role within a complex animal. Sperm provide a fascinating example of how multiple specializations combine to promote one distinct function—delivering the male pronucleus to the egg to produce a fertilized zygote. One specialization is that sperm chromatin has been compacted to prepare for its delivery into the egg, resulting in transcriptional silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref002">2</xref>]. As a result, changes in sperm phenotype or behavior must be accomplished without new gene transcription. A second specialization is that inactive sperm from many species are stored until ejaculation, when they undergo dramatic postmeiotic transitions called sperm activation, capacitation, or spermiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref004">4</xref>]. In this process, the immotile spermatid becomes a mature, motile sperm. Precisely regulated activation conserves energy until it is needed to drive motility and fertilization.</p>
<p>Only the early stages of spermatogenesis involve changes in gene expression; thus, sperm activation occurs in cells with transcriptionally silent nuclei. Because well-established pathways such as wnt, hedgehog, receptor tyrosine kinase, TGFβ, and Notch do not appear to mediate activation, sperm are likely to use novel signaling pathways to induce this phenotype. And because sperm activation is widespread in animals, the mechanisms that control it might be ancient and conserved. To date, these mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is ideal for studies of sperm differentiation and activation. In this species, inactive spermatids are round and immotile, with membranous organelles located just beneath the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref005">5</xref>]. During activation, these organelles fuse with the plasma membrane, and major sperm protein (MSP) is reorganized into filaments that generate a pseudopod for crawling. This amoeboid movement is common in nematode sperm and may be adapted to the folded surfaces of the female or hermaphrodite reproductive tracts.</p>
<p>Forward genetic screens for sterile animals have resulted in the identification of many genes that are essential for one or more steps of sperm development in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref007">7</xref>]. The molecular analysis of these genes has identified proteins that participate in two distinct signal transduction pathways that regulate sperm activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref004">4</xref>]. One of these pathways is triggered by a secreted trypsin protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref008">8</xref>], but the signal for the other pathway remains elusive. Although several chemicals that can activate sperm in vitro have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref010">10</xref>], they have not resolved this problem. Here we demonstrate that the zinc transporter ZIPT-7.1 plays a critical role in this second sperm activation pathway.</p>
<p>To identify new genes involved in sperm biology, we analyzed mutations that cause hermaphrodites to become self-sterile. The new mutations <italic>hc130</italic> and <italic>as42</italic> cause a loss-of-function in <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, resulting in partial or complete sterility in both sexes. This defect is due to a failure of sperm activation, a function conserved in the related nematode <italic>C</italic>. <italic>tropicalis</italic>. The ZIPT-7.1 protein is homologous to mammalian ZIP7, a zinc transporter from the ZIP family. We confirmed that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ZIPT-7.1 can act as a zinc-selective importer in cultured cells. Moreover, ZIPT-7.1 is expressed in the nematode germ line, consistent with a function in sperm. Genetic studies indicate that it interacts with other genes involved in sperm activation and functions downstream of <italic>spe-6</italic>. Finally, ZIPT-7.1 can bind the presenilin SPE-4.</p>
<p>Thus, we propose a new model for sperm activation. In spermatids, inactive ZIPT-7.1 is localized to the membranous organelles, which contain much higher levels of zinc than the cytoplasm. When activation is triggered, a signal transduced by the SPE-8 group of proteins opposes SPE-4 and SPE-6. As their function decreases, ZIPT-7.1 becomes active and transports zinc into the cytoplasm. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic zinc promotes the phenotypic changes that are characteristic of activation, including motility. Thus, the release of zinc from internal stores is a key part of the signal transduction process that mediates sperm activation.</p>
<p>These discoveries have important implications for the fields of zinc biology and sperm activation. Zinc is essential for all life and has well-established functions as a cofactor for numerous proteins. Zinc binding is necessary for the tertiary structure of many of these proteins, such as zinc finger transcription factors, and zinc binding to many enzymes is critical for catalysis. Although it has been suggested that changes in zinc concentration in specific compartments might have second messenger effects, it has been difficult to demonstrate this type of signaling. The best-established setting is the extracellular release of zinc during synaptic transmission, which changes the concentration of zinc in the synaptic cleft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref011">11</xref>]. By contrast, examples of zinc signaling that control cell fate and development are lacking. Our demonstration that a zinc signal controls sperm activation places zinc signaling in a specific biological context, in which changes in cell identity cannot be mediated by changes in gene expression. Furthermore, we have identified a zinc transporter that is central to this activation process. Finally, our discoveries show that signal transduction using zinc can control how cells differentiate during development.</p>

<title>Identification of the nematode <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> gene</title>
<p>Two independent lines of investigation converged on <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> as a critical regulator of fertility. The first approach was based on a forward genetic screen for sterile <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> hermaphrodites, which led to the identification of the recessive mutation <italic>hc130</italic>. Genetic mapping experiments were used to position this mutation to the right of <italic>dpy-4</italic>, near the end of chromosome <italic>IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and whole genome sequencing revealed a missense mutation that eliminated the ATG start codon of T28F3.3, a gene located in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The second approach was designed to elucidate mechanisms of zinc biology by conducting a reverse genetic study of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genes encoding ZIP proteins. Homology searches identified 14 such genes, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that many are closely related to human proteins. Thus, we named these genes ZRT- and IRT-like protein transporters (<italic>zipt</italic>) and assigned numbers corresponding to the most similar human genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s005">S1 Table</xref>). By analyzing deletion alleles, we discovered that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1(ok971)</italic>, which deletes T28F3.3, caused hermaphrodite sterility. Complementation tests showed that <italic>hc130</italic>/<italic>ok971</italic> heterozygotes were sterile, confirming that the missense mutation identified in T28F3.3 causes the <italic>hc130</italic> phenotype.</p>
<p>Finally, we used a screening procedure in which sterile mutants were identified by their failure to form “bags-of-worms” when prevented from laying eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref012">12</xref>] to identify another mutation that causes this phenotype. This allele, <italic>as42</italic>, has a G797A mutation in T28F3.3, which changes a glycine to glutamic acid within a predicted transmembrane domain. Taken together, these three alleles identify a previously uncharacterized <italic>zipt</italic> gene required for nematode fertility.</p>

<title><italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is needed to promote sperm function in both hermaphrodites and males</title>
<p>To analyze <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> function, we studied the null allele <italic>ok971</italic>, which deletes the entire coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Whereas wild-type hermaphrodites had an average brood size of 225 self progeny, and individuals were invariably fertile, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mutants had significantly smaller broods, and most individuals were completely sterile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Thus, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> loss-of-function causes a fully penetrant reduction in the number of self progeny and partially penetrant sterility. Furthermore, these mutant hermaphrodites laid large numbers of unfertilized oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), which implies that the MSP signal that stimulates ovulation is intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref013">13</xref>].

<p>To characterize this fertility defect, we used differential interference contrast (DIC) optics to view live animals. In wild-type hermaphrodites, sperm actively moved into the two spermathecae. As a result, each ovulation resulted in fertilization and the release of a new embryo into the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites the spermathecae were empty and scattered spermatids and unfertilized oocytes were visible in the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We infer that the mutant sperm retained the ability to stimulate ovulation but were unable to migrate back to the spermathecae after being pushed into the uterus during ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>To study male sperm, we used crosses with self-sterile hermaphrodites or females. We first tested the ability of male sperm to compete with <italic>spe-8</italic> hermaphrodite sperm, which fail to activate unless stimulated by male seminal fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref014">14</xref>]. The wild-type male sperm competed efficiently with <italic>Trans</italic>-activated <italic>spe-8</italic> hermaphrodite sperm, fertilizing all of the oocytes and yielding only cross progeny. By contrast, the <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> male sperm competed poorly, fertilizing only a minority of the oocytes and resulting in numerous self progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>To learn if the <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> male sperm were defective in competition or had an absolute decline in function, we measured the ability of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> males to fertilize <italic>fog-2</italic> females, which make no self-sperm. Even though the <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mutant sperm had no competition, we observed a dramatic decrease in successful fertilizations compared to wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Thus, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> activity promotes the function of sperm in both hermaphrodites and males, and it appears to regulate either activation or motility.</p>

<p>Nematode spermatids remain round and immotile until they receive an activating signal, which causes them to extend a pseudopod and begin to crawl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref004">4</xref>].

<p>It was technically challenging to visualize the ZIPT-7.1 protein in situ. Two different polyclonal antibodies raised against ZIPT-7.1 peptides were unable to detect ZIPT-7.1 expression in situ, although they could detect ZIPT-7.1 expressed in human cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s003">S3 Fig</xref>); thus, in vivo expression levels might be low. Multiple attempts to insert epitope tags into the endogenous locus were unsuccessful. Ultimately, we used gene editing to insert sequences encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the endogenous <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> locus to encode a fusion protein with GFP inserted in the first predicted cytoplasmic loop, between amino acids 25 and 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Animals homozygous for the modified allele developed normally, demonstrating that this GFP::ZIPT-7.1 fusion protein is functional. Protein expression could only be detected with anti-GFP antibodies, because the expression level was too low to observe GFP fluorescence. We found that GFP::ZIPT-7.1 expression levels were highest in developing spermatocytes, consistent with the analysis of transcript expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Furthermore, it appeared to be excluded from the nucleus and concentrated in puncta in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it localized to subcellular organelles. GFP::ZIPT-7.1 could not be visualized in spermatids or mature sperm with this protocol, which could be due to its low level of expression.</p>
<p>Based on these data, we hypothesized that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> functions cell autonomously to promote sperm activation. To test this model, we used RNA interference (RNAi) in <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutants. Wild-type animals are susceptible to RNAi in the germ line and most somatic cells. By contrast, <italic>rrf-1</italic> function is required for RNAi to work in most of the somatic tissues, so <italic>rrf-1(</italic>−<italic>)</italic> mutants are mainly susceptible to RNAi in the germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref019">19</xref>]. RNAi directed against <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> caused similar sterility in both wild-type and <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Thus, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is necessary in the germ line to promote fertility.</p>
<p>Taking all of these results together, we conclude that ZIPT-7.1 functions in developing sperm to regulate activation, rather than in the soma to control an activating signal.</p>

<title>ZIPT-7.1 regulates intracellular zinc levels</title>
<p>Many ZIP family proteins specifically transport zinc, but some transport iron or other metals. Thus, we investigated the role of ZIPT-7.1 in zinc biology. To analyze levels of labile zinc in vivo, we isolated male spermatids and stained them with Zinpyr-1, a dye that fluoresces when it binds zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref020">20</xref>]. Wild-type spermatids displayed punctate fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref010">10</xref>].

<p>If <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> functions in zinc biology, then its expression might be regulated by the level of available zinc. To test this prediction, we cultured wild-type animals with the zinc-specific chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) to induce zinc deficiency and analyzed <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> transcript levels. Although the expression of control genes did not change, levels of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mRNA increased 4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), consistent with the model that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> plays an in vivo role in zinc biology. This finding is consistent with a recent report by Dietrich and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref021">21</xref>] that the <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> locus contains a low zinc activation (LZA) enhancer motif that mediates transcriptional activation in response to low dietary zinc.</p>
<p>To test the prediction that ZIPT-7.1 transports zinc, we expressed it in mammalian cells and measured its subcellular localization and zinc uptake using radioactive <sup>65</sup>Zn. We used human HeLa cells for localization studies because of their well-defined cellular architecture. Antibody staining revealed that ZIPT-7.1 was expressed in a punctate pattern, and some puncta appeared to colocalize with the <italic>Cis</italic>-Golgi marker GM130 and the lysosomal marker LMP2. In addition, some ZIPT-7.1 appeared to be localized on the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g005">Fig 5D–5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We used human HEK293T cells for uptake studies because of their high efficiency of transfection. The expression of ZIPT-7.1 significantly increased the uptake of radioactive <sup>65</sup>Zn from the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g005">Fig 5J–5L</xref>). Furthermore, this transport activity was zinc specific, because it was effectively competed by nonradioactive zinc but not by several other metal ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g005">Fig 5K and 5L</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, three lines of evidence suggest that ZIPT-7.1 is a zinc-specific transporter. (1) The expression of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> transcripts in nematodes is regulated by zinc, (2) it controls intracellular zinc levels in developing spermatids, and (3) it is capable of specifically transporting zinc across membranes when assayed in mammalian cells.</p>

<p>To see if the function of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is conserved, we used gene editing to alter exon #1 of the <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> gene in the related hermaphroditic species <italic>C</italic>. <italic>tropicalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref025">25</xref>]. We recovered seven mutant alleles, including two frameshift mutations predicted to eliminate gene function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Both of these frameshift mutations caused hermaphrodite sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). We tested one allele in males, for whom it also caused sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Finally, Zinpyr-1 staining showed that this mutation resulted in reduced zinc accumulation in spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>).

<p>In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, multiple genes can be mutated to block sperm activation or cause constitutive activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref004">4</xref>]. These genes have been organized into two genetic pathways, and the subcellular localizations of several proteins have been identified. In hermaphrodites, sperm activation is controlled by an unknown signal that acts through five proteins located at the cell membrane of the spermatid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref004">4</xref>]. Mutations in any of these five genes (<italic>spe-8</italic>, <italic>spe-12</italic>, <italic>spe-19</italic>, <italic>spe-27</italic>, or <italic>spe-29</italic>) prevent activation. By contrast, mutations in <italic>spe-6</italic> and <italic>spe-4</italic> suppress the defective activation phenotype produced by these <italic>spe-8</italic> group genes and also cause male sperm to activate prematurely, prior to ejaculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref027">27</xref>].

(B) Model of the biochemical function of ZIPT-7.1 at three times during sperm activation: (1) Primed spermatid: prior to activation, spermatids are primed to respond—ZIPT-7.1 (dark blue) is inactive and localized to the membrane of a vesicle that has a high internal concentration of stored zinc (orange circles) and is presumably the membranous organelle (light blue). The cytoplasm has a low concentration of zinc, and the equilibrium of zinc-regulated proteins (purple) is shifted towards unbound. (2) Release: a sperm-activating signal results in activation of ZIPT-7.1 (orange arrow), zinc begins to flow into the cytoplasm, and zinc-regulated proteins begin binding zinc. (3) Activated spermatozoon: the cytoplasmic concentration of zinc is now high, and zinc-regulated proteins are bound to zinc. The pseudopod extension begins (lower), and the membranous organelles fuse with the plasma membrane. Fusion of membranous organelles is based on previously published observations of this event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref028">28</xref>], and our results do not directly address whether ZIPT-7.1 is relocalized during this process.</p>

<p>In males, sperm can also be activated by the extracellular protease TRY-5, which is likely to act through the membrane protein SNF-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref029">29</xref>]. Prior to ejaculation, TRY-5 is inhibited by the SWM-1 protease inhibitor, which prevents premature activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref030">30</xref>]. Thus, <italic>swm-1</italic> mutant males have abnormally active sperm crawling inside the reproductive tract, similar to <italic>spe-6</italic> or <italic>spe-4</italic> mutant males. The phenotype of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1(</italic>−<italic>); swm-1(</italic>−<italic>)</italic> double mutant males was intermediate between that of each single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), so <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> might function in parallel to the <italic>try-5</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>To complement these genetic experiments, we performed biochemical studies using the split-ubiquitin two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

Thus, SPE-4 might directly inhibit ZIPT-7.1 function in spermatids to prevent premature sperm activation, and relief of this inhibition by the sperm activation pathway might allow ZIPT-7.1 to transport zinc, elevating the zinc concentration in the cytoplasm and promoting sperm activation.</p>

<title><italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> encodes a ZIP family zinc transporter that plays a critical role in sperm activation</title>
<p>The analysis of three mutations demonstrates that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> promotes sperm activation. Two are molecular null alleles—<italic>hc130</italic> eliminates the start codon and <italic>ok971</italic> deletes the entire coding region—whereas <italic>as42</italic> changes a glycine to glutamic acid in a predicted transmembrane domain. All three mutations severely reduced production of hermaphrodite self progeny, and rescue by crossing with wild-type males indicates a defect in hermaphrodite sperm. There is also a defect in male sperm, because <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mutant males were impaired in fertilizing hermaphrodites. Spermatids dissected from <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> hermaphrodites had failed to activate, and mutant spermatids from either sex responded poorly to triggering agents like zinc, Pronase, or trypsin, pinpointing the problem to sperm activation.</p>
<p>Whereas other animals such as fruit flies and humans have a single ZIP7 gene, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> has two—<italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>2</italic>—suggesting a gene duplication occurred in nematodes. These two genes have separate functions, because the <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>2(ok960)</italic> mutation causes lethality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wormbase.org" xlink:type="simple">wormbase.org</ext-link>), indicating that somatic functions of ZIP7 are necessary for survival and are provided by <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>2</italic>. To determine if these specializations have been conserved in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, we obtained mutations of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> in the related nematode <italic>C</italic>. <italic>tropicalis</italic>. As observed with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>tropicalis zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mutations caused a decrease in hermaphrodite and male fertility, indicating a sperm defect in both sexes, and abnormal zinc staining of spermatids, indicating a defect in zinc biology. Thus, the duplication of the ZIP7 genes during <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> evolution appears to have been accompanied by the specialization of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> to control sperm development. As a result, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> z<italic>ipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is a powerful model for studying ZIP7 genes during reproduction, because the essential functions of ZIP7 transporters are covered by its sister, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>2</italic>, thereby avoiding the complexities of pleiotropic phenotypes and inviable mutants.</p>
<p><italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is the first zinc transporter to be implicated in sperm activation, and this discovery opens up exciting new models for the role of zinc in this process of rapid cell differentiation. We hypothesize that ZIPT-7.1 mediates the regulated release of zinc from the lumen of intracellular vesicles, and that released zinc functions as a second messenger to promote sperm activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). A variety of approaches have led to the identification of multiple genes that are involved in sperm development in worms, but <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is the first of these genes to have a clear role in zinc biology. In other animals, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates, zinc transporters have not been demonstrated to function in sperm activation, highlighting the novelty of this discovery.</p>

<title>Zinc may act as a second messenger to induce sperm activation in nematodes</title>
<p>Sperm activation is a unique cell differentiation process that is rapidly induced in response to extracellular cues but does not involve transcriptional changes. Despite extensive investigations in multiple species, the signaling cascade that initiates sperm activation remains poorly defined. Here we propose that ZIPT-7.1 mediates the release of zinc from intracellular organelles in spermatids and that zinc may function as a second messenger that promotes sperm activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ZIPT-7.1 is similar to human ZIP7 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Catsup, which implies that it transports a divalent cation. When expressed in mammalian cells, ZIPT-7.1 robustly increased zinc uptake, and competition experiments demonstrated that this transport was relatively specific for zinc. Thus, the zinc transport activity of ZIPT-7.1 was predicted by homology and confirmed by biochemical studies. Furthermore, ZIPT-7.1 protein localized primarily to internal membranes of mammalian cells, including the lysosome and Golgi, so it is likely to control release of zinc from internal stores. This localization pattern is similar to that of vertebrate ZIP7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref031">31</xref>], which implies that it is an evolutionarily conserved property of ZIP7 family members.</p>
<p>In nematodes, the expression and function of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> are restricted to germ cells. First, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mRNA was predominantly expressed in the germ line. Second, a GFP::ZIPT-1 fusion protein expressed from the endogenous locus was localized in developing spermatocytes. Third, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1(RNAi)</italic> caused sterility in an <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutant background, in which sensitivity is restricted primarily to the germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref019">19</xref>], indicating that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> functions in germ cells. These results suggest that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> does not act in the soma to produce an activation signal but in sperm to mediate their response.</p>
<p>Two additional observations link <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> to zinc biology. First, <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mRNA levels increased in response to zinc deficiency. Dietrich and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref021">21</xref>] discovered an LZA enhancer element in the <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> gene that likely mediates this regulatory response. Second, the levels of labile zinc were reduced in spermatids from mutant animals, showing that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is required for the uptake and storage of wild-type levels of zinc in developing spermatocytes. Taken together, these observations pinpoint the expression pattern of ZIPT-7.1 (gonad), its site of action (gonad), its biochemical activity (zinc transporter increasing cytoplasmic zinc), and its subcellular localization (primarily internal membranes).</p>

Both pathways contain negative regulatory genes that, when mutated, cause spermatids to activate constitutively and prematurely: <italic>spe-6</italic> and <italic>spe-4</italic> in the SPE-8 pathway and <italic>swm-1</italic> in the TRY-5 pathway. We took advantage of these alleles to perform genetic epistasis studies. A <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mutation strongly suppressed the <italic>spe-6</italic> phenotype, suggesting that <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> acts downstream of <italic>spe-6</italic> if these genes act in a linear pathway. It remains possible that they function in parallel.</p>
<p>To characterize ZIPT-7.1 interactions with the SPE-8 pathway further, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate protein–protein interactions. ZIPT-7.1 specifically bound SPE-4, a nematode presenilin that localizes to internal membranes in spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref032">32</xref>]. The role of presenilins in the regulation of zinc has formed an important area of research in Alzheimer disease for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref033">33</xref>]. The fact that SPE-4 also acts late in the sperm activation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref027">27</xref>] and can bind ZIPT-7.1 supports the model that ZIPT-7.1 functions downstream of other known proteins in the SPE-8 pathway. Taken together, these results are consistent with the model that ZIPT-7.1 acts inside spermatids at the end of the known SPE-8 pathway to transmit an extracellular signal that triggers sperm activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005069.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>

<title>Zinc signaling might play a conserved role in sperm activation</title>
<p>The effects of zinc on sperm have been investigated in several animals, including vertebrates (human, mouse, hamster), sea urchin, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Our results extend previous studies by (1) identifying the relevant zinc transporter and (2) providing a unified model for the function of zinc during sperm activation.</p>
<p>Sea urchin spermatids are normally ejaculated into sea water, and diluting them into sea water triggers activation and sperm motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref034">34</xref>]. Further studies demonstrated that zinc is the active ingredient in sea water and that zinc causes an increase in intracellular pH and intracellular calcium levels, triggering the acrosome reaction, a membrane fusion event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref035">35</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which zinc activates sea urchin sperm has not been defined, and no zinc transporters have thus far been implicated. The role of zinc in vertebrate sperm activation has been controversial; experiments with zinc chelators and the addition of supplemental zinc have suggested a variety of roles for zinc, indicating its importance, but specific functions have remained elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>High levels of extracellular zinc can activate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> sperm in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref010">10</xref>], but the direct mechanism was not previously defined. We propose that physiological sperm activation involves zinc release from intracellular stores, which increases the cytoplasmic concentration of zinc and causes activation. High extracellular zinc leads to zinc entry into spermatids, thereby mimicking this physiological signal. The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> model is similar to sea urchins in that rising concentrations of zinc stimulate sperm activation, with the difference that extracellular zinc is the physiological source in sea urchins, whereas intracellular stores are likely to be the physiological source in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Although high levels of extracellular zinc can activate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> sperm in a <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic>–dependent manner in vitro, our results suggest this is unlikely to be the physiological trigger, because <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> acts downstream of SPE-8 pathway proteins located at the spermatid membrane.</p>

<title>Sperm activation opens up new biology for zinc signaling</title>
<p>Well-established functions for zinc involve stable binding to proteins to influence tertiary structure or facilitate catalysis. In addition, zinc has been proposed to act as a second messenger, like calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref037">37</xref>], but this function is just beginning to be explored and many questions remain. Proposed examples of zinc signaling can be divided into extracellular and intracellular. In the vertebrate nervous system, zinc is concentrated in synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters and released into the synaptic cleft upon nerve stimulation, where it may modulate the activity of neurotransmitter receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref011">11</xref>]. The second example of extracellular release is the “zinc spark” that has been visualized during mammalian oocyte fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref038">38</xref>]. This spark is caused by the synchronous fusion of many zinc-containing vesicles. In both cases, zinc is released to the extracellular space by vesicle fusion. By contrast, Yamasaki and colleagues visualized an intracellular “zinc wave” in vertebrate mast cells that had been stimulated to undergo degranulation by an extracellular ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref039">39</xref>]. This zinc wave appeared to originate from the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, a rapid increase in cytoplasmic zinc has been observed in T lymphocytes and leukocytes responding to extracellular signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref041">41</xref>]. Finally, Hogstrand and colleagues proposed that the vertebrate ZIP7 is localized to intracellular membranes and mediates a zinc signal in breast epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>The results presented here identify a new biological system for zinc signaling—sperm activation. It is intriguing that the “zinc wave” in mast cells mediates degranulation, a vesicle fusion event, and the zinc signal in sperm also mediates vesicle fusion. These results raise the possibility that intracellular zinc signals have a conserved function in promoting vesicle fusion. Our results are consistent with the model of vertebrate ZIP7 mediating an intracellular zinc signal, although the cell type and biological consequences are entirely different. Because nematode sperm activation can be dissected by forward and reverse genetics and manipulated both in vivo and in vitro, it offers a powerful model to define mechanisms of zinc signaling.</p>

<title>Multiple ion fluxes during sperm activation</title>
<p>A critical question in sperm biology is how the rapid and dramatic changes that define activation are controlled without transcriptional regulation. The answer may involve converging lines of research on ion fluxes. First, it is well established for many animals, including nematodes, that intracellular pH increases during sperm activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref009">9</xref>]. Lishko and Kirichok identified a voltage-gated proton channel that mediates this pH rise in human sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref043">43</xref>]. Second, calcium signaling has been repeatedly implicated in sperm activation and plays an important role in nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref045">45</xref>]. The CatSper channel mediates this increase in intracellular calcium in mammalian sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref046">46</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> does not have an obvious homolog of CatSper, but they do contain multiple predicted calcium channels; thus, calcium signaling in worms could be mediated by an alternative channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref048">48</xref>]. Third, we propose here that zinc is a second messenger that activates sperm, and ZIPT-7.1 is the relevant transporter.</p>
<p>Considering our results in light of the documented roles of other ions, we speculate that sperm activation might be caused by a coordinated change in the cytoplasmic levels of three different ions: H<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and Zn<sup>++</sup>. According to this model, a sperm activation signal results in the activation of an H<sup>+</sup> exporter, a calcium importer, and the zinc importer ZIPT-7.1. The activity of these transporters changes the cytoplasm from a high concentration of H<sup>+</sup> and low concentrations of Ca<sup>++</sup> and Zn<sup>++</sup> (the spermatid state) to a low concentration of H<sup>+</sup> and high concentrations of Ca<sup>++</sup> and Zn<sup>++</sup> (the activated state). Changes in protein activity could result from alterations of pH and interactions with zinc and calcium cofactors without the need for altered transcription. Individual proteins might be influenced by one or more of these ion changes, and the combination of all three ion changes might rapidly alter the activity of a large number of proteins. Future work will be required to identify specific target proteins and determine whether pH, calcium, zinc, or a combination causes changes of protein activity.</p>

The target site conformed to the sequence G(N19)NGG; the initial G optimizes transcription driven by the U6 promoter, and the NGG (PAM) motif is required for Cas9 activity.</p>
<p>To insert the sgRNA sequence into the CRISPR-Cas9 vector pDD162 (Addgene, #47549), the vector was amplified using primers that had a 15-bp overlap sequence (primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s006">S2 Table</xref>) and Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Next, the PCR products were treated with <italic>Dpn</italic>I to remove the vector template and transformed into TOP10 competent cells. The plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>To insert <italic>gfp</italic> into the endogenous <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> locus, we built a homologous recombination template comprised of left-arm sequence (1,031 bp), GFP deleted-stop-codon sequence with a 6 amino acid linker, and right-arm sequence (1,316 bp). The left- and right-arm sequences were amplified from genomic DNA using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase and primers P1 and P5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s006">S2 Table</xref>) and inserted into the pPD95.77 backbone by In-fusion cloning (ClonTech). Next, the GFP sequence was amplified and inserted between the left and right arms. Positive clones were identified by the PCR, and the final plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>We injected Cas-9-sgRNA, homologous recombination template, and the selection marker pRF4 (<italic>rol-6</italic>) into N2 hermaphrodites at 50 ng/μL concentration. F<sub>1</sub> Rol progeny were placed on individual dishes and harvested for PCR analysis after laying eggs for one to two days. We used primers P3 and P6 to identify worms that contained the <italic>gfp</italic> insert, and primers P2, P3, and P4 to screen their progeny for homozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s006">S2 Table</xref>). The <italic>gfp</italic> knock-in worms were confirmed by DNA sequencing the PCR product of primers P2 and P4.</p>

<title>Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid analysis</title>
<p>The split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assay used the DUALmembrane kit (Dualsystems Biotech) per manufacturer's instructions. The <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> gene was amplified from <italic>him-5</italic> cDNA using primers Sp24-1Forward and Sp24-1179Reverse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Next, we amplified a truncated portion of <italic>zipt-7</italic>.<italic>1</italic> using primers Sp24-1Forward and C-Sfi-Sp24-1116Reverse, and cloned this fragment into the bait plasmid pBT3-STE. This construct expresses a form of ZIPT-7.1 lacking the last 21 C-terminal amino acids, which includes the final predicted transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005069.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Based on the predicted topology of ZIPT-7.1, this alteration is necessary to localize the ubiquitin tag (which is fused to the C-terminal end of ZIPT-7.1) in the cytoplasm. Details describing the constructs for each prey protein are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref062">62</xref>].</p>
<p>The yeast strain NMY51 was transformed with ZIPT-7.1 bait plasmid and selected on synthetic medium lacking leucine. These yeasts were then transformed with prey plasmid and selected on synthetic medium lacking both leucine and tryptophan. Each resulting strain harbored the bait plasmid and one type of prey plasmid; the ability to turn on reporter genes was tested by plating on synthetic medium lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ade. Yeast cells transformed with bait plasmid and pAI-Alg5, which expresses wild-type Nub (N-terminal ubiquitin), served as a positive control. Yeast cells transformed with bait plasmid and empty prey vectors pPR3-STE or pPR3-N were used as negative controls.</p>

<title>ZIPT-7.1 localizes to internal cell membranes.</title>
<p>(A) Model showing the location of peptides in ZIPT-7.1 used to generate antibodies in rabbits: residues 68–82 (blue) and 138–150 (green). Numbers indicate predicted transmembrane segments. The model shows a predicted membrane topology based on TMpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref063">63</xref>], but other algorithms give somewhat different results regarding the number of transmembrane domains (varies from 6 to 8) and whether there is a signal peptide, so the diagram shows only one of several possibilities. The illustration was generated using Protter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005069.ref064">64</xref>]. (B, C) HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing ZIPT-7.1, whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and ZIPT-7.1 protein was detected with the indicated antibodies by western blotting. MW markers in kDa are shown at left. Lanes 1–4 had decreasing amounts of lysate (shown as μL input) from cells expressing ZIPT-7.1 (+), and lane 5 had lysate from untransfected control cells (−). A red arrowhead marks ZIPT-7.1 based on its predicted molecular weight (43.3 kDa) and absence from the control. (D–R) HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing ZIPT-7.1, fixed in formaldehyde, and double labelled with antibodies against ZIPT-7.1 (68–82) (D, G, green), ZIPT-7.1 (138–150) (J, M, green), or against both ZIPT-7.1 (68–82) and ZIPT-7.1 (138–150) (P, green), and <italic>Cis</italic>-Golgi marker protein GM130 (E, K, red), lysosomal marker protein LMP2 (H, N, red), or ER marker protein calnexin (Q, red). Confocal fluorescence micrographs of representative HeLa cells show that (1) ZIPT-7.1 did not colocalize with the ER marker (R), (2) the epitope recognized by aZIPT-7.1 (68–82) colocalized primarily with the Golgi marker (F) and minimally with the lysosome marker (I), and (3) the epitope recognized by aZIPT-7.1 (138–150) colocalized primarily with the lysosome marker (O) and minimally with the Golgi marker (L). Arrowheads indicate apparent colocalization of ZIPT-7.1 with GM130 or LMP2 (yellow). Bar, 5 μm. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; kDa, kilodalton; MW, molecular weight.</p>
