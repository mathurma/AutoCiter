</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Male and female sexes have evolved repeatedly in eukaryotes but the origins of dimorphic sexes and their relationship to mating types in unicellular species are not understood. Volvocine algae include isogamous species such as <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, with two equal-sized mating types, and oogamous multicellular species such as <italic>Volvox carteri</italic> with sperm-producing males and egg-producing females. Theoretical work predicts genetic linkage of a gamete cell-size regulatory gene(s) to an ancestral mating-type locus as a possible step in the evolution of dimorphic gametes, but this idea has not been tested. Here we show that, contrary to predictions, a single conserved mating locus (<italic>MT</italic>) gene in volvocine algae—<italic>MID</italic>, which encodes a RWP-RK domain transcription factor—evolved from its ancestral role in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> as a mating-type specifier, to become a determinant of sperm and egg development in <italic>V. carteri</italic>. Transgenic female <italic>V. carteri</italic> expressing male <italic>MID</italic> produced functional sperm packets during sexual development. Transgenic male <italic>V. carteri</italic> with RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdowns of <italic>VcMID</italic> produced functional eggs, or self-fertile hermaphrodites. Post-transcriptional controls were found to regulate cell-type–limited expression and nuclear localization of VcMid protein that restricted its activity to nuclei of developing male germ cells and sperm. Crosses with sex-reversed strains uncoupled sex determination from sex chromosome identity and revealed gender-specific roles for male and female mating locus genes in sexual development, gamete fitness and reproductive success. Our data show genetic continuity between the mating-type specification and sex determination pathways of volvocine algae, and reveal evidence for gender-specific adaptations in the male and female mating locus haplotypes of <italic>Volvox</italic>. These findings will enable a deeper understanding of how a master regulator of mating-type determination in an ancestral unicellular species was reprogrammed to control sexually dimorphic gamete development in a multicellular descendant.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Sexual differentiation in eukaryotes is manifested in two fundamentally different ways. Unicellular species may have mating types where gametes are morphologically identical but can only mate with those expressing a different mating type than their own, while multicellular species such as plants and animals have male and female sexes or separate reproductive structures that produce sperm and eggs. The relationship between mating types and sexes and whether or how an ancestral mating-type system could have evolved into a sexually dimorphic system are unknown. In this study we investigated sex determination in the multicellular green alga <italic>Volvox carteri</italic>, a species with genetic sex determination; we established the relationship of <italic>V. carteri</italic> sexes to the mating types of its unicellular relative, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. Theoretical work has suggested that sexual dimorphism could be acquired by linkage of gamete size-regulatory genes to an ancestral mating-type locus. Instead, we found that a single ancestral mating locus gene, <italic>MID</italic>, evolved from its role in determining mating type in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to determine either spermatogenesis or oogenesis in <italic>V. carteri</italic>. Our findings establish genetic and evolutionary continuity between the mating-type specification and sex determination pathways of unicellular and multicellular volvocine algae, and will enable a greater understanding of how a transcriptional regulator, <italic>MID</italic>, acquired control over a complex developmental pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In many unicellular and simple multicellular eukaryotes sexual interactions are governed by mating types. Among sexually reproducing organisms mating types are thought to have evolved before gamete size differences and separate sexes evolved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Hoekstra1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Parker1">[2]</xref>. Mating types (defined below) control sexual differentiation and specialized roles of cells that function as gametes in a diverse range of taxa including fungi, algae, ciliates, and cellular slime molds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ni1">[3]</xref>–. In mating-type systems gametes can be isomorphic but can only mate with partners that express a different mating type than their own. Male and female gametes, on the other hand, are a hallmark of multicellular organisms such as metazoans and land plants. Males and females have developmentally specialized gamete types: large immotile eggs that are produced by females or female reproductive organs, and small motile sperm produced by males or male reproductive organs. The groundbreaking theory proposed by Parker and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Parker2">[7]</xref> modeled the evolution of anisogamy (asymmetric-sized gametes) from a starting population of isogametes (i.e., mating types) and identified the evolutionary forces that might cause a mating-type system to evolve into anisogamy (large and small gamete types) or oogamy (eggs and sperm). Additional theories and modifications to the original ideas of Parker and colleagues have been proposed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Hoekstra1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Randerson1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Blute1">[10]</xref>), but very little attention has been given to the mechanism through which natural selection might act on a mating-type system to drive the transition to anisogamy or oogamy. One model involves the establishment of genetic linkage between a polymorphic locus that affects gamete size and a mating-type locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Charlesworth1">[11]</xref>. However, the genetic basis for the evolution of anisogamy/oogamy has not been determined in any experimental system, and it is not known whether it requires the addition of size control genes or other genes to an ancestral mating locus as the model proposes.</p>
<p>Volvocine algae are an excellent model for investigating the evolution of sexual dimorphism. They form a monophyletic clade encompassing a progression from unicellular species to multicellular forms with increasing organismal size and cell-type specialization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Kirk1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Bell1">[13]</xref>. Volvocine algae all have a haploid vegetative reproductive cycle, but under specific conditions can be induced to undergo sexual differentiation and mating to form dormant diploid zygospores. Zygospores undergo meiosis and produce haploid progeny that reenter the vegetative phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Umen1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Goodenough1">[14]</xref>. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and smaller colonial volvocine genera are isogamous, while larger colonial forms are anisogamous or oogamous as is the case with the genus <italic>Volvox</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Nozaki1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Coleman1">[16]</xref>. Some species of <italic>Volvox</italic> and other anisogamous volvocine algae are heterothallic with genetically determined male and female sexes, while others are homothallic with a single clone producing a mixture of all-male and all-female colonies (dioecy), or homothallic with a single clone producing colonies containing both male and female gametes (monoecy) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Coleman1">[16]</xref>). Previous studies have made use of volvocine algae to evaluate theories relating to the evolution of anisogamy and oogamy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Bell1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Knowlton1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Wiese1">[19]</xref>, but the genetic basis for sexual dimorphism in this clade is still unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Umen1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Nozaki2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, the two genetically determined mating types, <italic>plus</italic> and <italic>minus</italic>, are morphologically similar, but express mating-related genes that allow fusion with a partner of the opposite mating type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Goodenough1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ning1">[22]</xref>. Gametic differentiation in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> is triggered by absence of nitrogen (−N) and is governed by a mating locus (<italic>MT</italic>) whose two haplotypes, <italic>MT+</italic> and <italic>MT−</italic>, are large, rearranged multigenic regions, which are suppressed for recombination and therefore segregate as Mendelian alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-DeHoff1">[24]</xref>. The <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> gene <italic>MID</italic> (<italic>CrMID</italic>) is present only in the <italic>MT−</italic> haplotype and encodes a putative RWP-RK family transcription factor whose expression is induced by −N and that governs gametic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris3">[25]</xref>. The presence of <italic>MID</italic> activates the <italic>minus</italic> differentiation program and represses the <italic>plus</italic> program, while the absence of <italic>MID</italic> causes activation of the <italic>plus</italic> program and repression of the <italic>minus</italic> program. A second <italic>MT−</italic> gene, <italic>MTD1</italic>, also contributes to <italic>MT−</italic> gametic differentiation but is not essential for it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Lin1">[26]</xref>. <italic>MID</italic> is a rapidly evolving gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris4">[27]</xref>, but orthologs have been found in <italic>MT−</italic> strains or in males of all volvocine algae examined to date including <italic>VcMID</italic> in <italic>V. carteri</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Nozaki2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris4">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Hamaji2">[30]</xref>. However, the role of <italic>MID</italic> in sex determination has not been investigated outside of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Volvox carteri f. nagariensis</italic> (hereafter <italic>V. carteri</italic>) is a spheroidal multicellular alga whose vegetative form is identical for males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Each vegetative spheroid contains ∼2,000 sterile flagellated somatic cells on the periphery that provide motility, while inside the spheroid are ∼16 large immotile reproductive cells called gonidia. All of the cells are embedded within a clear extracellular matrix that comprises most of the spheroid volume. The two-day vegetative reproductive cycle begins with mature gonidia undergoing embryogenesis to form new miniature juvenile spheroids. During embryogenesis a programmed series of symmetric and asymmetric cleavage divisions occurs to produce a hollow ball of 2,000 small cells with 12–16 large cells on the anterior surface. The process of inversion then turns the embryo inside out so that the large cells end up on the interior of the spheroid where they will differentiate into new gonidia, and the small cells end up oriented with their basal bodies facing outward, and will begin to grow flagella as they undergo somatic differentiation. Over the next 1.5 days the juveniles grow, mature into adults, hatch, and begin the cycle again (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Kirk2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Kirk3">[32]</xref>). Unlike <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> that uses a nutrient trigger for gametogenesis, sexual differentiation in <italic>V. carteri</italic> is triggered by a diffusible glycoprotein hormone called sex-inducer that is active on both sexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Kochert1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Mages1">[35]</xref>. In response to sex-inducer, gonidia from vegetative females and males undergo modified embryogenesis programs to produce sexual spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr2">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Kochert2">[37]</xref>. Sexually induced female spheroids have ∼2,000 somatic cells similar to vegetative females, but inside contain 32–48 large egg cells that are formed during embryogenesis through altered timing of asymmetric cell divisions. Sexually induced male spheroids develop with 128 somatic cells and 128 large cells called androgonidia that are also produced through modification of asymmetric embryonic division patterning. The day after male sexual embryogenesis each androgonidial cell undergoes additional cleavage divisions to form a packet of 64 or 128 sperm cells. Sperm packets hatch and swim together to a sexual female where they break apart into individual sperm that enter the female through a fertilization pore. Sperm swim within the female until they find an egg and then fuse with it to form a diploid zygospore. Upon germination a single vegetative meiotic progeny is formed while the remaining three meiotic products are discarded as polar bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr3">[38]</xref>.</p>

(B) Key stages of the two-day vegetative reproductive cycle are depicted with relative timing indicated by the interior clock diagram showing the 16 h light and 8 h dark phases. Starting from ∼6:00 and going clockwise vegetative gonidia undergo embryonic cleavage followed by inversion to make new juvenile spheroids. Juveniles grow and eventually hatch and mature into the next generation of parental spheroids. The vegetative cycle is identical for males and females. (C) Key stages of the sexual cycle are depicted top to bottom starting with vegetative male or female gonidia that have been exposed to sex-inducer. Sexually induced gonidia undergo modified embryogenesis to produce sexual males with 128 large androgonidia and 128 somatic cells, or sexual females with 32–48 eggs. Subsequent cleavage of androgonidia produces sperm packets that are released and swim to a female whereupon they dissolve into single sperm and enter the female spheroid to fertilize eggs. Diploid zygotes differentiate into environmentally resistant, orange-pigmented, dormant zygospores that when germinated undergo meiosis and produce three polar bodies plus a single haploid vegetative progeny that can reenter the vegetative reproductive cycle.</p>

<p>Sexual differentiation in <italic>V. carteri</italic> is controlled by a dimorphic sex-determining locus (<italic>MT</italic>) with haplotypes designated <italic>MTM</italic> (male) and <italic>MTF</italic> (female). <italic>V. carteri MT</italic> occupies an equivalent chromosomal position to <italic>C. reinhardtii MT</italic> based on flanking syntenic gene content, but is at least 5-fold larger. Compared with <italic>C. reinhardtii MT V. carteri MT</italic> contains more sequence rearrangements between haplotypes, more repeat sequences, and has gametolog pairs (genes with an allele in both <italic>MT</italic> haplotypes) that are far more differentiated from each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-DeHoff1">[24]</xref>. <italic>V. carteri MTF</italic> and <italic>MTM</italic> haplotypes can thus be considered a UV sex chromosome pair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Bachtrog1">[39]</xref>. As described above, it has been proposed that anisogamy or oogamy could evolve through a size-regulatory gene becoming linked to an ancestral mating locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Charlesworth1">[11]</xref>. Both <italic>MTM</italic> and <italic>MTF</italic> haplotypes contain a putative cell-size regulatory gene, <italic>MAT3</italic>, whose alleles are highly dimorphic in sequence and expression between the sexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>. However, it is now apparent that anisogamy and oogamy in volvocine algae predate the appearance of <italic>MAT3</italic> allelic dimorphism in the lineage meaning that other mating locus genes probably underlie the origins of anisogamy and oogamy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Hiraide1">[40]</xref>. Although <italic>MTM</italic> contains a <italic>MID</italic> homolog, <italic>VcMID</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), its role in sexual differentiation is unclear because <italic>VcMID</italic> mRNA is expressed constitutively in both vegetative and sexual stages of males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>. The apparent uncoupling of <italic>VcMID</italic> expression from the sexual cycle suggests that the VcMid protein might have a function outside of the sexual cycle or that its function might be regulated differently than that of <italic>CrMID</italic> whose expression is induced by −N.</p>
<p>In this study, we tested the role of <italic>VcMID</italic> in <italic>V. carteri</italic> sex determination by making transgenic females that express VcMid protein or by knocking down its expression in males using RNAi. We found that expression of <italic>VcMID</italic> in females is sufficient to convert eggs to sperm packets, while its absence in males causes androgonidial cells to differentiate into eggs. However, alteration of VcMid expression did not affect female or male early embryonic patterning during which the number and location of germ-cell precursors is established. We found that <italic>VcMID</italic> mRNA is expressed in all cell types, but VcMid protein accumulation is regulated by cell type and its subcellular localization is restricted to nuclei of differentiating and mature male gametes. Swapping experiments with CrMid demonstrated that the VcMid DNA binding domain and N-terminal domain are both required for its function in directing spermatogenesis in <italic>V. carteri</italic>. Crosses with sex-reversed strains revealed sexually antagonistic interactions between genes in <italic>MT</italic> and the sexual development pathway controlled by VcMid that negatively impacted reproductive fitness when gamete type did not match the mating locus genotype.</p>

<p>We tested the role of VcMid protein in sexual differentiation by generating female transgenic lines with an autosomally integrated <italic>VcMID</italic> transgene (pVcMID-BH) expressed under its own promoter and fused to a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) and a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at its C-terminus to detect expression (<italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s001">S1B</xref>). Female transformants carrying an untagged version of <italic>VcMID</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s001">Figure S1C</xref>) had identical phenotypes as those carrying the tagged version, and all subsequent work was done with tagged strains and untagged transformants as a negative control for detection of VcMid protein. <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> lines showed a normal vegetative phenotype and constitutively expressed the mRNA for the <italic>VcMID-BH</italic> transgene, an expression pattern identical to the endogenous <italic>VcMID</italic> mRNA in males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>. As described above, when wild-type vegetative female gonidia are exposed to sex inducer they undergo modified embryogenesis and develop into sexual spheroids with 32–48 eggs and ∼2,000 sexual somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). When wild-type vegetative male gonidia are exposed to sex inducer they undergo modified embryogenesis and develop with 128 sperm packets and 128 somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). When vegetative gonidia from <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> lines were exposed to sex inducer they developed into progeny spheroids with a novel pseudo-male sexual phenotype: They produced ∼2,000 somatic cells and 32–48 sexual germ-cell precursors in a pattern similar to that of female eggs; but each of the 32–48 germ-cell precursors in the <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> lines underwent additional cleavage divisions like male androgonidia to produce sperm packets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, the sperm produced in <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> lines were capable of fertilizing wild-type female eggs to produce characteristically orange-pigmented, thick-walled zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). However, male function was incomplete as fertility defects were noted (see next section). Similar to wild-type sperm (and unlike wild-type female eggs) the <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> sperm cells were terminally differentiated and could not revert back to vegetative growth if left unfertilized. Another male-specific phenotype exhibited by <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> lines was frequent spontaneous occurrence of sexual differentiation in vegetative cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr2">[36]</xref>, a trait whose underlying basis is not clear, but which appears to be under the control of <italic>VcMID</italic>.</p>

<title>VcMid Is Required for Spermatogenesis and Represses Oogenesis in Males</title>
<p>In order to test whether <italic>VcMID</italic> is necessary for sexual differentiation of males we developed a new strategy for gene knockdown on the basis of RNAi-inducing hairpin constructs. The hairpin-forming portion of the construct corresponding to <italic>VcMID</italic> sequences was inserted directly into the 3′ UTR of the <italic>nitA</italic> selectable marker gene to allow direct and simultaneous selection of both NitA+ and hairpin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g004">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s010">S10</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s015">Text S1</xref>). This strategy has been successful for other loci besides <italic>VcMID</italic> (unpublished data), but only the results for <italic>VcMID</italic> are presented here. We also note that the <italic>VcMID</italic> knockdown phenotype was gene specific and did not occur when hairpins targeting other loci were introduced into <italic>V. carteri</italic> (unpublished data). Two hairpins targeting <italic>VcMID</italic> (<italic>VcMID-hp1</italic> and <italic>VcMID-hp2</italic>) were introduced into a <italic>V. carteri</italic> wild-type male strain <italic>AichiM</italic> to generate <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp1</italic> and <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp2</italic> transgenic lines (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). All transgenic male strains had normal vegetative phenotypes, and both hairpin constructs reduced <italic>VcMID</italic> expression; but <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp1</italic> lines had lower <italic>VcMID</italic> transcript levels than <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp2</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We note that unlike wild-type males or pseudomales (see above), vegetative cultures of <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp1</italic> lines did not undergo spontaneous sexual induction. Sexually induced <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp1</italic> lines with strong knockdowns showed a novel phenotype: Their early sexual development proceeded as it would for a wild-type male strain and resulted in spheroids that contained 128 small somatic cells and 128 large cells that resembled uncleaved androgonidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), but the large cells never underwent further cleavage into sperm packets. Instead, many of them could be successfully fertilized with wild-type male sperm to make <italic>MTM/MTM</italic> diploid zygospores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The ability to differentiate as zygospores when fertilized indicates that the presumptive androgonidia in <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp1</italic> strains were converted to functional eggs and that these strains were behaving as pseudo-females. However, unlike normal zygotes from a wild-type cross, 30%–50% of the zygotes from <italic>AichiM</italic>×<italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp1</italic> pseudo-female crosses died and bleached shortly after fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), a phenotype that depended on addition of exogenous sperm. The surviving zygotes from these crosses produced some viable meiotic progeny, but germination and survival of the progeny were reduced compared with normal wild-type zygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s011">Table S1</xref>). 29/43 viable progeny inherited the <italic>VcMID-hp1</italic> transgene and developed as pseudo-females, while 14/43 lacked the transgene and developed as normal males. The apparent deviation from a 1∶1 inheritance pattern of the transgene was noted but was not pursued further in this study. The high mortality of pseudo-female eggs—whose mating loci are genetically male—suggest that <italic>MTF</italic> contains genes that promote female gamete and/or zygote fitness that are absent from <italic>MTM</italic>. If left unfertilized, the eggs from <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp1</italic> lines could de-differentiate and reenter the vegetative reproductive cycle as do unfertilized female eggs. A similar phenotype as our pseudo-male strain was reported previously for a male mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr4">[41]</xref>, but the mutant strain is no longer available for characterization.</p>

<title>Deep Homology between Mating Types and Sexes</title>
<p>Although it was reasonable to predict that the route for evolving sexual dimorphism would be through addition of new genetic functions and pathways to a core mating locus as proposed originally by Charlesworth for the evolution of anisogamy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Charlesworth1">[11]</xref>, we found instead that a single conserved volvocine algal mating locus gene, <italic>MID</italic>, is largely responsible for controlling male versus female sexual differentiation in <italic>V. carteri</italic>. It is notable that <italic>VcMID</italic> controls multiple sexual traits in <italic>V. carteri</italic> that have no analogs in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. The male traits controlled by <italic>VcMID</italic> include specialized cleavage divisions of androgonidia, sperm packet inversion, sperm packet hatching, specialized sperm cell morphology, and gamete recognition without flagellar adhesion.</p>
<p>The term deep homology is used to describe ancient and conserved genetic mechanisms that control traits that, on the surface, appear disparate or have no obvious homology relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Shubin1">[44]</xref>. Metazoan eye development is a classic example; across phyla with very different eye architecture, it is controlled by the conserved transcription factor, eyeless/Pax6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Gehring1">[45]</xref>. In the case of volvocine algae Mid proteins control two very different manifestations of sexual reproduction in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>V. carteri</italic> whose <italic>MID</italic> orthologs have been diverging for as long as 200 million years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Herron1">[46]</xref>. Sexually dimorphic gametes have evolved from isogamous ancestors several times in independent multicellular taxa, and the mechanism could be similar to, or different from, that in volvocine algae where a master regulatory gene acquired the ability to direct sperm-egg dimorphism. Oogamy was likely established very early in the Streptophyte lineage before the split between Charophyte algae and land plants, but the origins and bases of oogamy in Charophytes remain unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-McCourt1">[47]</xref>. The recent identification of an anisogamous sexual cycle in a Choanoflagellate—a unicellular relative of metazoans—introduces the potential for investigating the early evolution of gamete size dimorphism in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Levin1">[48]</xref>.</p>

<p>Transcriptional regulatory network evolution has been studied in various developmental contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Pires1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Monteiro1">[53]</xref>, but very little is known about how regulatory networks are modified or coopted during unicellular to multicellular transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Aravind1">[54]</xref>. The Mid system in volvocine algae represents a new opportunity for understanding how a cell-type specification pathway in a unicellular ancestor evolved to control a complex developmental program in a multicellular descendant. While mating-type differentiation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> appears to involve differential expression of a small number of genes between the <italic>plus</italic> and <italic>minus</italic> gametes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Goodenough1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ning1">[22]</xref>, a larger set of differentially expressed genes might be expected to specify sperm and eggs, which are developmentally very different from each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Kochert2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr5">[55]</xref>.

<p>Another interesting question is whether <italic>MID</italic>-like genes function in sex determination in green algae outside of the volvocine lineage. The molecular bases for sex determination in most green algae and protists are poorly understood, but RWP-RK family proteins are found throughout the green eukaryotic lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Schauser1">[56]</xref>, including small Mid-like proteins in Prasinophyte algae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Worden1">[57]</xref>, and even in distantly related Cryptophyte algae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Curtis1">[58]</xref>. It remains to be seen whether these Mid-like proteins in non-volvocine species function in sex determination.</p>

<title>Evolution of Mid and Sexual Cycles in the Volvocine Lineage</title>
<p>As described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>, volvocine algae exhibit wide diversity in their sexual cycles: There are isogamous, anisogamous, and oogamous species with sexual cycles that can be heterothallic or homothallic. Among homothallic species some are dioecious (producing a mixture of all male and all female sexual offspring) or monoecious (producing sexual offspring containing gametes of both sexes in one individual) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Coleman1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr5">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>V. carteri</italic> is a heterothallic species with genetically determined sexes; but, a remarkable phenotype was produced by a partial RNAi knockdown of <italic>VcMID</italic> in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Rather than developing as male or female, the partial-knockdown male spheroids became self-fertile monoecious hermaphrodites that produced sperm and eggs in a single individual. On the basis of this observation, it can be inferred that sexual differentiation in <italic>V. carteri</italic> is bi-stable and highly sensitive to initial <italic>MID</italic> dosage. Once the Mid-sensitive step of development is initiated (which may coincide with nuclear translocation of VcMid protein), positive and negative feedback loops may be used to lock the sex determination program into a male or female state. This state could be achieved either independently of VcMid concentration, or through positive/negative reinforcement of initial expression states. The phenotype of hermaphroditic development by partial <italic>VcMID</italic> knockdown may be relevant to the evolution of homothallism, which appears to have arisen in all three major clades of <italic>Volvox</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Coleman1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr5">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Smith1">[59]</xref>. We speculate that naturally evolved homothallic volvocine algae possess a <italic>MID</italic> gene whose expression is insufficient to specify 100% male gamete production—much like our <italic>VcMID-hp2</italic> strains. Moreover, the timing of <italic>MID</italic> expression in homothallic species of <italic>Volvox</italic> could play a role in determining monoecious versus dioecious reproductive development: If the Mid-sensitive developmental switch is triggered relatively late in development after germ-cell precursors are formed then a mixture of male and female gametes could develop within a single spheroid as we found with <italic>VcMID-hp2</italic> strains (i.e., homothallism, monoecy). In contrast, if the Mid-sensitive step occurred very early in development before individual germ cells were established, then the fate of all germ cells within a mature spheroid might be locked into a male or female program and the resulting population would produce a mixture of all-female or all-male spheroids (i.e., homothallism, dioecy).</p>
<p>The bi-stability of sex determination at intermediate levels of <italic>MID</italic> expression in <italic>V. carteri</italic> is also reminiscent of the <italic>iso1</italic> mutant phenotype in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> where <italic>MT− iso1</italic> cells differentiate into a mixture of <italic>plus</italic> and <italic>minus</italic> gametes that iso-agglutinate but cannot self-fertilize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Campbell1">[60]</xref>. The self-infertility of <italic>iso1 MT−</italic> strains is due to the absence of <italic>FUS1</italic>, a gene from the <italic>MT+</italic> haplotype that is required for gamete fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris5">[61]</xref>. In contrast, there are no essential genes in <italic>MTF</italic> of <italic>V. carteri</italic> that are absolutely required for fertilization and subsequent germination of progeny from matings between pseudo-females (<italic>VcMID</italic> knockdown strains) and males. This lack of essential female <italic>MT</italic> genes for completing the sexual cycle may have facilitated transitions from heterothallism to homothallism in volvocine algae.</p>

<title><italic>V. carteri</italic> Has Evolved New Regulatory Inputs for Mid</title>
<p>In volvocine genera other than <italic>Volvox</italic>—including the anisogamous genus <italic>Pleodorina</italic>— sexual differentiation and <italic>MID</italic> expression are both triggered by the absence of nitrogen (−N) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Nozaki2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris3">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Hamaji1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Nozaki3">[62]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>V. carteri f. nagariensis</italic> and other <italic>Volvox</italic> species use species-specific pheromones called sex inducers to trigger sexual differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Coleman1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Starr5">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-AlHasani1">[63]</xref>. A seemingly parsimonious evolutionary route for rewiring input into the Mid pathway in <italic>V. carteri</italic> would simply place <italic>VcMID</italic> transcription under the control of sex inducer instead of nitrogen availability. Unexpectedly, however, <italic>VcMID</italic> mRNA and VcMid protein are both expressed constitutively at all life cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s004">S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>, and unlike the case in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, VcMid appears to be under at least three types of posttranscriptional control: (i) Although <italic>VcMID</italic> mRNA is present in both vegetative cell types (somatic and gonidial cells), VcMid protein is only translated or stably produced in somatic cells and is absent from vegetative gonidia and vegetative embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g003">Figures 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s006">S6B</xref>). (ii) The VcMid protein produced in somatic cells is excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g003">Figures 3L–3O</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s006">S6I–S6P</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s009">S9C–S9J</xref>). (iii) In response to the presence of sex inducer, VcMid protein accumulates in the nuclei of cleaving androgonidial cells and in the nuclei of sperm cells where it is presumed to function in specifying sperm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g003">Figure 3B–3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s005">S5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s006">S6C–S6H</xref>).</p>
<p>In depth study will be required to determine how cell-type–regulated production and localization of VcMid are achieved, but it seems reasonable to infer that one or more factors are produced in sexually induced spheroids that promote the translation and/or stability of VcMid and its nuclear localization in androgonidia and sperm. The factor may interact directly with VcMid as a partner and may help specify its localization at promoters of target genes, but this idea remains to be tested. The absence of VcMid protein in vegetative gonidia despite its message accumulating to the same extent as in somatic cells seems puzzling at first glance. However, the block in stability or translation of VcMid in gonidia may have evolved as a failsafe mechanism to prevent sexual differentiation during vegetative embryogenesis. Such a mechanism would be unnecessary in vegetative somatic cells that are already terminally differentiated, but could potentially be important for vegetative gonidial cells because male sexual differentiation is irreversible and would be fatal if it occurred at the wrong time. However, why vegetative somatic cells express VcMid remains a mystery. As noted in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>, we observed no obvious vegetative phase phenotypes in <italic>AichiM::VcMID-hp</italic> strains whose somatic cells were missing VcMid, or in <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> strains that contained VcMid in somatic cells, but a definitive conclusion about whether cytoplasmic VcMid has a role in vegetative somatic cells awaits more in depth examination.</p>

<title>Uncoupling of Gender from Sex Chromosome Identity Uncovers Possible Sexually Antagonistic Interactions in the <italic>MT</italic> Locus</title>
<p>Our results show that the presence or absence of <italic>VcMID</italic> is the key determinant of differentiation in <italic>V. carteri</italic> sexual spheroids; yet the <italic>MT</italic> locus of this alga has around 70 additional genes, many of which show sex-biased gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>. Some of the <italic>MT</italic> genes are present only in the male or only in female haplotype, while the majority are male and female gametolog pairs that are highly diverged in sequence and expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>. Our ability to uncouple gender from sex chromosome identity by manipulation of <italic>VcMID</italic> expression allowed us to uncover potential contributions of male and female <italic>MT</italic> genes to sexual dimorphism and reproductive fitness. Haploid sex chromosome systems have received less attention than diploid systems, but there are several predictions about them that our results begin to address. Under haploid dioecy, recessive mutations in sex-linked genes are not sheltered from selection as they are in the heterogametic sex of diploid systems, and are therefore expected to degenerate equally and lose only genes required for the opposite sex and not their own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Bull1">[64]</xref>. We note, however, that in <italic>V. carteri MT</italic> there is no evidence for an allele of a gametolog pair having been eliminated from one mating haplotype and retained in the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>. Haploid sex chromosomes are predicted to be similar to diploid systems in that both should accumulate sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit one sex, but harm the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Bachtrog1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Rice1">[65]</xref>, and should accumulate repeat sequences, as appears to have occurred in both <italic>Volvox</italic> and in the bryophyte <italic>Marchantia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Yamato1">[66]</xref>. Accumulation of sexually antagonistic alleles has not been tested for haploid sex chromosomes, but the extensive divergence between <italic>V. carteri MT</italic> gametologs suggests that this phenomenon may contribute to the developmental and fitness defects we observed in pseudo-male and pseudo-female strains.</p>
<p>Although none of the sex-limited <italic>MT</italic> genes besides <italic>VcMID</italic> appear to be essential for <italic>V. carteri</italic> sex determination and completion of the sexual cycle, they clearly impact sexual development and reproductive fitness. A striking phenotype for both the pseudo-male and pseudo-female strains was the patterning of their germ-cell precursors formed during sexual development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g002">Figures 2B–2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g006">6A–6C</xref>). It is clear from these phenotypes that sexual germ cell patterning (i.e., the number and distribution of germ-cell precursor cells and ratio of germ-cell precursors to sexual somatic cells) is separable from germ cell differentiation and is not controlled by the VcMid pathway. Instead, this sexual patterning trait must be controlled by other <italic>MT</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g006">Figure 6</xref>). One candidate for this male-female patterning difference is the <italic>MAT3</italic> gene that encodes the retinoblastoma-related homolog in <italic>V. carteri</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Ferris1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Prochnik1">[67]</xref>. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, Mat3 protein controls the multiple fission cell cycle by establishing the threshold size at which division can occur and by coupling the extent of cell division to mother cell-size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Umen3">[68]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Fang1">[69]</xref>. Although not directly involved in determining gamete cell-size as we had originally predicted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001904-Hiraide1">[40]</xref>, it is possible that the male and female alleles of <italic>VcMAT3</italic> dictate the timing of asymmetric cell divisions by coupling embryonic blastomere cell-size to the asymmetric division machinery.

<title>Summary of the roles of <italic>VcMID</italic> and the mating locus in sexual differentiation.</title>
<p>The upper section shows the process of sexual differentiation, top to bottom, starting from vegetative spheroids that are treated with sex inducer. The fate of a single sexually induced gonidia is shown in each case with its phenotype after embryogenesis and after sexual differentiation. Labels to the left show the stages depicted. Labels to the right show the developmental events that are controlled independently by the mating locus (early embryonic patterning) and the VcMid pathway (germ cell differentiation). (A–D) The four columns depict the fates of wild-type females (A), wild-type males (B), females expressing VcMid (pseudo-males) (C), and males with VcMid knocked down (pseudo-females) (D). The table below summarizes mating locus genotype, early embryonic patterning, VcMid expression, germ cell differentiation, and phenotypic outcome for each of the four strains. Male and female patterns are colored in blue and red, respectively.</p>

<p>In addition to defects in germ cell patterning in <italic>Volvox</italic> pseudo-males and pseudo-females, these strains show other reproductive defects. These include abnormal sperm cell shape and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001904-g002">Figures 2H, 2I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s003">S3B–S3F</xref>), low efficiency of sperm packet hatching (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s003">Figure S3D</xref>), and delayed timing of androgonidial cleavage into sperm packets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001904.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). In depth study may reveal other defects in pseudo-male sperm related to cytoskeletal organization, gamete recognition, motility, and fertilization dynamics. Although egg cells lack distinct morphological features like sperm, we noted a very high mortality rate in pseudo-female eggs that occurred when we attempted fertilization. The mortality we observed under these conditions could be due to pre-zygotic defects in the eggs caused by their smaller size than wild-type female eggs or by a mismatch between the male mating locus and the female sexual differentiation pathway. The mortality might also be due to zygotic defects that occur when a copy of the female mating locus is absent from the zygote immediately after fertilization. Future work aimed at developing quantitative assays for distinct steps of fertilization will allow us to document in more detail the fitness contributions of male and female <italic>MT</italic> genes to the sexual cycle.</p>

Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 250 mg/ml anti-HA, 1∶2,000; and 2 mg/ml anti-α-tubulin, 1∶20,000, all diluted in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. Blocking was performed with 40 ml of 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for one hour. Blots were incubated overnight at 4°C min (anti-HA antibody). Blots were washed three times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 10 min, then horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) was used at 1∶2,500 dilution and incubated with blots at room temperature in PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. Blots were then washed three times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 10 min and then briefly rinsed with deionized water. Antigen was detected by chemiluminescence (Luminata Forte Western HRP Substrate, Millipore) using autoradiographic film (HyBlot CL autoradiography film, Denville Scientific Inc.)</p>

<p><italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> or <italic>Eve::VcMID</italic> (as a negative control) samples were processed in parallel and imaged under identical conditions. Spheroids were collected using a magnetic funnel with a 25 µm nylon mesh filter (Pall Scientific). Sexual spheroids were fixed with 2% or 4% paraformaldehyde with 1× plant protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) (10 µl/ml), 1 µm ALLN (catalog number 208719, VWR International), 1 µm MG132 (catalog number 133407-82-6, Cayman Chemical), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h on ice. Spheroids or cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in cold methanol (−20°C) for five minutes. The methanol wash was repeated two more times and then samples were washed again with PBS and rehydrated in PBS at room temperature for 15 min after which they were adhered to poly-L-lysine–coated cover slips. Cover slips were blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (5% BSA and 1% cold-water fish gelatin) and incubated for 30 min in the same buffer with 10% (v/v) normal goat sera (Antibodies Incorporated). Cover slips were incubated overnight in anti-HA 1∶500 (1∶300 for somatic cell staining) in 20% blocking buffer at room temperature or at 4°C and washed 6×10 min with 20% blocking buffer in PBS 0.05% Tween 20. After washing out unbound primary antibody cover slips were incubated with AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) 1∶500 (1∶300 for somatic cells staining) in 20% blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (for 4 h at 4°C for somatic cells staining) in the dark. Following six washes with 20% blocking buffer diluted in PBS and 0.05% Tween20, the cover slips were incubated for 15 min in 2 µg/ml DAPI and then washed for 5 min in PBS. Excess liquid was removed, and the cover slips were mounted with VectaShield (Vector Labs) or Mowiol∶PPD (PPD = p-phenylenediamine 1,4-Benzenediamine hydrochloride [Sigma P1519]) with a 9∶1 ratio. Microscopy was performed with a Leica DMI6000 B using DIC optics or using the following filter cube sets and illumination with a Prior Lumen 200 light source: A4: excitation BP 360/40; dichroic 400; emission BP470/40, L5: excitation BP 480/40; dichroic 505; emission BP 527/30. Where indicated Z stacks were subject to deconvolution using the Leica Advanced Fluorescence Application Suite. Images are representative of results from at least three independent experiments.</p>

<p><bold>Sperm development in wild-type male strain </bold><bold><italic>AichiM</italic></bold><bold> and pseudo-male strain </bold><bold><italic>Eve::VcMid-BH</italic></bold><bold>.</bold> (A) The diagram shows a comparison of the developmental chronology for spermatogenesis in wild-type male (<italic>AichiM</italic>) and pseudo-male (<italic>Eve::VcMid-BH</italic>) strains. Dark and light boxes in the middle depict successive diurnal cycles (16 h light∶8 h dark). The developmental chronologies start with newly formed, post-embryonic juvenile sexual spheroids (far left). In both strains the timing of development up to this stage is the same. The upper sequence depicts a wild-type male whose androgonidia begin dividing about one day post-embryogenesis. Fully mature sperm packets are formed by the end of the second dark cycle. The sperm packets are released from their parental vesicle and eventually dissociate into individual sperm cells by the middle of the next light cycle. The lower part of the panel shows the same sequence of events for pseudo-male strains whose androgonidia take a full extra day to begin dividing into sperm packets, and whose fully formed sperm packets are delayed in hatching from the parental vesicle. Scale bars for juvenile spheroids = 20 µm, early cleaving androgonidia = 10 µm, mature sperm packets = 25 µm, released sperm = 5 µm. (B) Dissociating sperm packet with wild-type mature sperm from <italic>AichiM</italic>. Black arrowhead shows a single mature sperm cell. Scale bar = 10 µm. (C) Two individual wild-type sperm cells from <italic>AichiM</italic> at higher magnification. Scale bar = 5 µm. (D) Dissociating mature sperm packet from <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> pseudo-male. The location of the mostly intact vesicle wall surrounding the sperm packet that would normally be dissolved in wild-type males is shown with a dashed line. Black arrowheads indicate cells with relatively normal elongated sperm-like morphology. Black arrows indicate rounded non-sperm-like cells that are only observed in sperm packets of pseudo-males. Scale bar = 20 µm. (E) and (F) Single sperm cells from <italic>Eve::VcMID-BH</italic> pseudo-males. The sperm cell in (E) is abnormally large while the sperm cell in (F) has a mislocalized eye-spot in the center rather than apical end of the cell. Scale bar = 5 µm.</p>
