<article-title>Plant Antiviral Defense Disables Other Defenders</article-title>

<abstract>
<p>Small RNAs play essential regulatory roles in genome stability, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in most eukaryotes. In plants, the RNaseIII enzyme DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) produces miRNAs, whereas DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 produce various size classes of siRNAs. Plants also encode RNASE THREE-LIKE (RTL) enzymes that lack DCL-specific domains and whose function is largely unknown. We found that virus infection induces RTL1 expression, suggesting that this enzyme could play a role in plant–virus interaction. To first investigate the biochemical activity of RTL1 independent of virus infection, small RNAs were sequenced from transgenic plants constitutively expressing RTL1. These plants lacked almost all DCL2-, DCL3-, and DCL4-dependent small RNAs, indicating that RTL1 is a general suppressor of plant siRNA pathways. In vivo and in vitro assays revealed that RTL1 prevents siRNA production by cleaving dsRNA prior to DCL2-, DCL3-, and DCL4-processing. The substrate of RTL1 cleavage is likely long-perfect (or near-perfect) dsRNA, consistent with the RTL1-insensitivity of miRNAs, which derive from DCL1-processing of short-imperfect dsRNA. Virus infection induces <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA accumulation, but viral proteins that suppress RNA silencing inhibit RTL1 activity, suggesting that RTL1 has evolved as an inducible antiviral defense that could target dsRNA intermediates of viral replication, but that a broad range of viruses counteract RTL1 using the same protein toolbox used to inhibit antiviral RNA silencing. Together, these results reveal yet another level of complexity in the evolutionary battle between viruses and plant defenses.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Most eukaryotes produce essential regulatory molecules called small RNAs. These molecules are produced primarily by a class of RNaseIII enzymes called DICER, which excises small RNA duplexes from long double-stranded (ds)RNA precursor molecules. Plants also encode several RNaseIII enzymes called RNASE THREE-LIKE (RTL), but the function of these proteins is largely unknown. Here, we show that RTL1 represses small RNA production by cleaving dsRNA before DICER can process them. RTL1 appears to specifically act on the templates of a class of small RNAs called siRNAs, but not on miRNA precursors, suggesting that it cleaves long-perfect (or near-perfect) dsRNA, but not short-imperfect dsRNA. We also found that RTL1 expression is induced after virus infection, suggesting that RTL1 could act as an inducible antiviral defense by destroying dsRNA intermediates of viral replication. Our findings suggest that viruses have evolved to inhibit RTL1 activity, ultimately resulting in successful viral infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, the biogenesis of small RNAs is either Dicer-dependent or Dicer-independent. Dicer-independent small RNAs resulting from the action of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, exoribonucleases, Argonaute (AGO) proteins, or a combination of these factors have been found in fungi, invertebrates, and mammals but not in plants or protists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref004">4</xref>]. In contrast, Dicer-dependent small RNAs are found in every eukaryotic kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref006">6</xref>], with the notable exception of a few yeast species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref009">9</xref>]. Dicer enzymes belong to the family of RNaseIII proteins, which are double-stranded (ds)RNA-specific endonucleases. All members of the RNaseIII family contain a characteristic RNaseIII domain composed of a highly conserved stretch of nine amino acid residues known as the RNaseIII signature motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref010">10</xref>]. RNaseIII proteins vary widely in length, from 200 to 2,000 amino acids, and have been subdivided into four classes based on their domain composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref011">11</xref>]. Class I is the simplest and the smallest, containing a single RNaseIII domain and a dsRNA (double stranded RNA) binding domain (DRB); the bacterial and bacteriophage RNaseIII proteins belong to this class. Class II proteins, like class I, contain both an RNaseIII domain and a DRB but are distinguished from class I by the presence of a highly variable N-terminal domain extension and include the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rnt1 and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> Pac1 proteins. Both of these yeast proteins are longer than bacterial RNaseIII proteins and contain an additional 100 amino acids at their N-terminus. Class III proteins have a DRB and two RNaseIII domains and include Drosha, which is involved in the first cut of miRNA precursors in animals but is incapable of producing small RNAs by itself. Class IV proteins correspond to animal and plant Dicer and contain an RNA helicase domain, a PAZ domain, either one or two RNaseIII domains, and one or two DRB domains. Animal and plant Dicer proteins are the only RNaseIII proteins that have been shown to produce small RNAs in the size range of 18–24 nt, with the exception of class II RNaseIII from a few budding yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The plant model <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> encodes four Dicer-like (DCL) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref012">12</xref>], which produce various classes of small RNAs. DCL1 produces the majority of microRNAs (miRNAs), which average around 21 nt in length and derive from relatively short, imperfectly double-stranded stem-loop RNA precursors transcribed from nonprotein coding <italic>MIR</italic> genes. By contrast, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 produce 22, 24, and 21 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively, which derive from long, dsRNA precursors originating from either long inverted repeats or from the action of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) on single-stranded RNA precursor. Multiple classes of siRNAs exist in plants. The largest class corresponds to POLYMERASE IV-dependent siRNA (p4-siRNAs), which are RDR2- and DCL3-dependent 24 nt siRNAs deriving from transposons and repeats. Trans acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) are RDR6- and DCL4-dependent 21-nt siRNAs, which derive from non-protein coding <italic>TAS</italic> genes. Endogenous inverted repeat-derived siRNAs (endoIR-siRNAs) do not depend on an RDR for their production because they derive from very long stem-loops. They come in different flavors, including DCL4-dependent 21 nt, DCL2-dependent 22 nt, and DCL3-dependent 24 nt siRNAs. At last, young miRNAs define a category of small RNA that is intermediate between DCL2-, DCL3-, and DCL4-dependent endoIR-siRNAs and DCL1-dependent old (conserved) miRNAs. Indeed, young miRNAs derive from foldback stem-loops of intermediate sizes, which are mainly processed by DCL4. Most 21 and 22 nt small RNAs are loaded onto AGO1 to guide the cleavage of complementary mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref006">6</xref>], whereas 24 nt siRNAs associate with AGO4, which recruits PolV and the chromatin remodeling protein DRD1, leading to transcriptional silencing through histone modification, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 also produce siRNAs in response to the entry of exogenous genetic material. For example, transient transgene expression leads to a consistent production of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs, even when the transgene has not been designed to produce an RNA that can fold into a dsRNA structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref014">14</xref>]. Following integration of the transgene into the genome, the production of siRNA continues if the transgene produces a dsRNA, but not if it produces a regular single-stranded mRNA. However, in some cases, sense transgenes undergo transcriptional or post-transcriptional silencing for reasons that still remain not perfectly understood. Infection by viruses also leads to a consistent production of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs during the first few days following infection. These siRNAs likely derive from viral RNAs partially folded into dsRNA or from dsRNA intermediates of viral replication. These siRNAs are loaded onto AGO1 and AGO2, which then target single-stranded viral RNA for cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref015">15</xref>]. Cleavage products generated by AGO1, but not AGO2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref016">16</xref>], have the capacity to be transformed into dsRNA by RDR1 and RDR6, which are subsequently processed into 21 and 22 nt secondary siRNAs by DCL4 and DCL2, which could in theory reinforce the cleavage of single-stranded viral RNA and thus eliminate the virus. However, this antiviral RNAi mechanism is often counteracted by proteins encoded by the virus itself, which are referred to as viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). VSRs have been identified in most viruses and target various components of the RNAi machinery, thus blocking RNAi with various efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref018">18</xref>]. Because there is generally a positive correlation between the strength of VSRs and the gravity of the symptoms caused by viruses, it has been proposed that the success of infection of a virus depends on the strength of its VSR. However, it remains possible that VSRs affect other function(s) of the plant than simply the RNAi machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Aside from DCL1–4, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome has the capacity to encode five proteins referred to as RNASE THREE-LIKE (RTL). RTL1, RTL2, and RTL3 harbor RNaseIII and DRB domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>], whereas RTL4 and RTL5 contain only RNaseIII domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref021">21</xref>]. RTL1, which carries one RNaseIII domain and one DRB domain, is weakly expressed in roots and below detection level by classical reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>]. Mutants defective for RTL1 are not available in any of the public <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> stock centers, and RTL1 function is unknown. RTL2, which contains one RNaseIII domain and two DRB domains, is ubiquitously expressed at low level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>]. RTL2 processes, both in vivo and in vitro, the 3’External Transcribed Spacer (ETS) from ribosomal <italic>45S</italic> pre-rRNA and enhances the production of exogenous siRNAs when overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref022">22</xref>]; however, mutants defective for RTL2 are viable and do not exhibit obvious developmental defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>]. RTL3 harbors two RNaseIII domains and three DRB domains, but its expression has not been detected in any tested tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>]. RTL4 and RTL5 carry a single RNAseIII domain but lack DRB domains, and both genes are expressed in almost every tissue. Whereas the targets of RTL4 remain unknown, mutants defective in RTL4 are impaired in male and female gametophyte formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref020">20</xref>]. RTL5 shares sequence similarity to maize RNC1, which is required for the splicing of several chloroplast group II introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref021">21</xref>]. Here, we show that RTL1 exhibits RNaseIII activity, and that its overexpression prevents the accumulation of all size classes of siRNAs but does not affect the accumulation of DCL1-dependent conserved miRNAs. Our results suggest that RTL1 cleaves long-perfectly (or near-perfectly) paired dsRNA, thus preventing the processing of these substrates by DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4. RTL1 is induced upon infection with a range of viruses, but the VSRs encoded by these viruses inhibit RTL1 activity, suggesting that RTL1 acts in plant antiviral defense while viruses have evolved counterdefenses that inhibit both RTL1 and RNA silencing defenses.</p>

<title>Viruses Specifically Induce RTL1</title>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type plants grown under laboratory conditions, RTL2, RTL4, and RTL5 are expressed throughout the plant. In contrast, RTL1 is weakly expressed in roots, while RTL3 is below detectable levels in all tested tissues ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref023">23</xref>] and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jsp.weigelworld.org/expviz/expviz.jsp" xlink:type="simple">http://jsp.weigelworld.org/expviz/expviz.jsp</ext-link>). Moreover, RTL1 and RTL3 have no known biological or biochemical function. Given that several key components of antiviral RNAi, including the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AGOs AGO1, AGO2, and AGO5 and rice AGO2 and AGO18, are induced during virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref027">27</xref>], and given that the RTL1 and RTL3 enzymes harbor RNaseIII and DRB domains that could bind to and cleave dsRNA intermediates of virus replication, we reasoned that RTL1 or RTL3 could help plants to fight against viruses if their expression is induced during virus infection and if they are expressed where viruses replicate. To test this hypothesis, we inoculated wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Col) plants with different single-stranded RNA viruses: turnip crinkle virus (TCV, a Carmovirus), turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV, a Tobamovirus), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, a Cucumovirus), and turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV, a Tymovirus), and we measured the accumulation of <italic>RTL1</italic> and <italic>RTL3</italic> mRNA. The accumulation of <italic>RTL2</italic> mRNA was also measured to examine a possible contribution of this protein during virus infection because it also harbors RNaseIII and DRB domains and is weakly expressed under regular conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref023">23</xref>]. Three weeks after inoculation, an ~20-fold increase in <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA accumulation was observed in systemically infected leaves, whereas the level of <italic>RTL2</italic> and <italic>RTL3</italic> mRNA remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This ~20-fold increase in <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA accumulation was observed after individual infection with the four viruses, indicating that increased <italic>RTL1</italic> expression is a general response to diverse virus infections.</p>

<p>Then, we analyzed the subcellular localization of RTL1 to determine if it accumulates in the cytoplasm where RNA viruses replicate.

In addition, an antibody directed against RTL1 was produced in rats (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Material and Methods</xref>), and the specificity of the antibody was tested by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). No signal was detected in wild-type seedlings, whereas a single band of the expected size was detected in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants ectopically expressing an epitope-tagged RTL1 protein (<italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> plants, see below). Then, RTL1 localization was analyzed by immunostaining of root cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Material and Methods</xref>). A weak signal was detected in wild-type roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), consistent with <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA being weakly expressed in roots of wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A stronger signal was detected in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), consistent with RTL1 being more abundant in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> plants than in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Immunostaining imaging revealed that the RTL1 protein is excluded from the nucleolus, but present in the nucleoplasm and in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Plants Overexpressing RTL1 Lack ta-siRNAs, endoIR-siRNAs, p4-siRNAs, and Certain Young miRNAs</title>
<p>Because viruses cause many changes at the developmental and molecular level, we decided to gain specific insight into the biochemical function of RTL1 by analyzing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic plants ectopically expressing RTL1 (<italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic>) instead of virus-infected plants. These plants exhibited a range of developmental defects, including smaller stature, yellowing and curled rosette leaves, late flowering, and sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We also produced transgenic plants overexpressing RTL1 proteins tagged with Flag or Myc epitopes and found that they generally exhibited milder or no developmental defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s010">S9 Fig</xref>), suggesting reduced activity of RTL1-tagged proteins. Progeny plants that had inherited the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> or <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-tag</italic> transgene exhibited the same developmental defects as their parents, whereas siblings that had segregated away the transgene looked like wild-type plants, indicating that developmental defects are directly caused by RTL1 overexpression</p>

<p>To determine if the small RNA repertoire of <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants is modified, RNA gel blot analyses were performed on flowers of three independent <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> transformants and on the two <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> transformants that were analyzed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Hybridization with representative miRNA and siRNA probes showed that levels of conserved (old) miRNA are largely unchanged in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants, whereas the levels of siRNAs are strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Note that the two <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> plants exhibit a lower decrease in siRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), which together with their reduced developmental defects suggests reduced stability or activity of the RTL1-Flag fusion protein (see below).</p>
<p>To obtain genome-wide small RNA profiling, small RNAs were sequenced from flowers of the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> line #1. A wild-type Col control and a <italic>dcl2 dcl3 dcl4</italic> triple mutant (<italic>dcl234</italic>) were also sequenced for comparison. Flowers were chosen because it is the tissue producing the highest variety of small RNAs. The distribution of the 17 to 30 nt reads matching the nuclear <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome but excluding tRNA and rRNA sequences was examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s014">S1 Table</xref>). Remarkably, the small RNA size distribution in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants strongly differed from that in Col, and in fact resembled that in <italic>dcl234</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Because conserved miRNAs accumulate to similar levels in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> and wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), sequence data were normalized to the 27 DCL1-dependent miRNAs that define the 22 conserved miRNA families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref028">28</xref>]. Analysis of the normalized chromosomal distribution of unique small RNA reads that do not correspond to conserved miRNAs, i.e., primarily siRNAs, revealed that <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants almost entirely lack siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Sorting siRNAs into their major functional categories showed that RTL1 overexpression strongly impacts the accumulation of ta-siRNAs, endoIR-siRNAs, and p4-siRNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g004">Fig 4</xref> for whole-genome analysis and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s003">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s004">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s005">S4</xref> Figs for the analysis of ta-siRNAs, endoIR-siRNAs, and p4-siRNAs representative loci). The level of several young miRNAs was also analyzed because their dsRNA precursors are intermediate between the long precursors of endoIR-siRNAs and the short precursors of canonical miRNAs.

<title>RTL1 Inhibits Transgene PTGS</title>
<p>Given the ability of RTL1 to inhibit the accumulation of endogenous siRNAs at 6,089 out of 6,102 loci, we examined whether RTL1 overexpression also impacted transgene-derived siRNAs.

As expected, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GU-UG</italic> + <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> infiltrated leaves accumulated high levels of 21 and 24 nt <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs, whereas <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GU-UG</italic> + <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic>-infiltrated leaves did not accumulate detectable levels of <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating that RTL1 prevents the accumulation of transgene siRNAs deriving from an inverted repeat.

<p>To monitor RTL1 and RTL1mR3 protein accumulation, two different epitope tags were added individually to RTL1 as C-terminal or N-terminal fusions, and then the RNaseIII domain was mutagenized.

The <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic> constructs reduced <italic>GU</italic> siRNA accumulation almost as efficiently as the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> control, whereas the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>Flag-RTL1</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>Myc-RTL1</italic> constructs had a weaker effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), suggesting that the addition of these N-terminal tags impacted RTL1 activity. Consistent with this observation, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>Flag-RTL1</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>Myc-RTL1 Arabidopsis</italic> transformants did not exhibit developmental defects, whereas <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic> transformants displayed developmental defects similar to, although less severe than, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s009">S8A Fig</xref>).

Note that the accumulation of <italic>GUS</italic> siRNA in <italic>L1/35S</italic>:<italic>Flag-RTL1</italic> plants confirms that <italic>L1</italic> is not subjected to transcriptional silencing when transformed by 35S-driven transgenes.</p>
<p>To ensure that the absence of developmental and molecular defects in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1mR3</italic> plants was not due to destabilization or impaired production of the RTL1 protein, the RNaseIII domain of the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic> construct was mutagenized as previously described, and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves were coinfiltrated with the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GU-UG</italic> and either <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic>, or <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1mR3-Myc</italic> constructs. <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GU-UG</italic> + <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1mR3-Myc</italic>-infiltrated leaves accumulated high levels of 21 and 24 nt <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs, whereas <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GU-UG + 35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic>-infiltrated leaves lacked <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), similar to the results obtained with nontagged <italic>RTL1</italic> and <italic>RTL1mR3</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). However, western blot analysis revealed that the RTL1mR3-Myc protein accumulated to a lower level than the RTL1-Myc protein in infiltrated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), raising concerns about the effect of the two introduced mutations on protein stability. To address this question, <italic>Arabidopsis L1</italic> plants were transformed with either <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic>, or <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1mR3-Myc</italic>, and the amount of RTL1-Myc and RTL1mR3-Myc protein was determined by western blot in a series of individual transformed plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Lines <italic>L1/35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic> #1 and #2 accumulated levels of RTL1 protein that are comparable with those of lines <italic>L1/35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1mR3-Myc</italic> #1 and #8. Thus, these four lines were further analyzed for endogenous and transgene siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Both <italic>L1/35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Myc</italic> plants exhibited high GUS activity and lacked <italic>GUS</italic> siRNAs and endogenous ta-siRNAs, whereas <italic>L1/35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1mR3-Myc</italic> plants lacked GUS activity and accumulated <italic>GUS</italic> siRNAs and endogenous ta-siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that RTL1 requires a functional RNaseIII domain to suppress small RNA accumulation.</p>

<title>RTL1 Cleaves Near-Perfectly Paired Long dsRNA</title>
<p>The effect of RTL1 on transgene siRNAs, ta-siRNAs, endoIR-siRNAs, p4-siRNAs, and certain young miRNAs could be explained by several, nonexclusive mechanisms:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>inhibition of the enzymes involved in the biogenesis of their dsRNA precursors,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>cleavage/degradation of their dsRNA precursors,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>inhibition of or competition with the DCLs processing their dsRNA precursors</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>cleavage or degradation of these small RNAs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The fact that RTL1 overexpression impairs the accumulation of endoIR-siRNAs and certain young miRNAs rules out that RTL1 inhibits RDR activity. Indeed, endoIR-siRNAs and young miRNAs are processed from self-complementary single-stranded RNAs that do not require RDR for their production. The fact that levels of ta-siRNAs, endoIR-siRNAs, p4-siRNAs, and certain young miRNAs are more strongly reduced in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants than in <italic>dcl234</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s006">S5 Fig</xref>) makes it also unlikely that RTL1 inhibits DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 activity or that RTL1 selectively degrades small RNAs produced by DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4. Indeed, the residual level of siRNAs observed in <italic>dcl234</italic> likely results from a weak activity of DCL1 on siRNA precursors in the absence of DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4, and the disappearance of these siRNAs in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants suggests that RTL1 acts upstream of the DCLs, including DCL1. Therefore, it is very tempting to speculate that RTL1 cleaves the dsRNA precursors of ta-siRNAs, endoIR-siRNAs, p4-siRNAs, certain young miRNAs, and transgene siRNAs, thereby preventing their processing by any of the four DCLs. To test this hypothesis, we examined the accumulation of the endoIR-siRNA precursor <italic>IR71</italic> because <italic>IR71</italic>-derived siRNAs are absent in plants expressing the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). RNA gel blot analysis revealed that the <italic>IR71</italic> precursor accumulates in flowers of <italic>dcl234</italic> but is below detectable level in wild-type Col, likely because it is efficiently processed by DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The <italic>IR71</italic> precursor did not accumulate in <italic>dcl234</italic> transformed with the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), suggesting that it is degraded or destabilized by RTL1.</p>

<p>Confirmation that RTL1 acts on dsRNA was further obtained using an in vitro cleavage assay. A soluble His-RTL1 fusion protein was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, purified to near homogeneity and incubated with total RNA extracted from wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings. RT-PCR analysis reveals that purified His-RTL1 cleaves <italic>IR71</italic> and <italic>IR2039</italic> precursor RNAs, which can be visualized by the absence of amplification in the presence of His-RTL1, whereas amplification is detected in RNA fractions incubated without His-RTL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Note that the IR71 precursor can be detected in Col extracts because RT-PCR is more sensitive than the RNA gel blot method used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and/or because DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are less expressed in seedlings than in flowers. Purified His-RTL1 also cleaves the hairpin located in the 3’ UTR of At3g18145 from which derives the 24 nt species that replace miR3440 in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s008">S7 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The proof that cleavage is due to RTL1 activity and not to bacterial RNaseIII contamination was obtained using His-RTL1 proteins mutated in the RNaseIII domain. For this purpose, His-RTL1 proteins mutated at single (E86A, E92W, D96A) or double (E89A/D96A) positions were used in the in vitro cleavage assay. RT-PCR analysis revealed that His-RTL1 and His-RTL1mR3 (E86A) are able to cleave At3g18145 3’UTR sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). In contrast, amplification was detected in RNA fractions incubated without proteins or incubated with His-RTL1 proteins mutated at residues E92 and D96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), indicating that RTL1 RNA cleavage activity requires a functional RNase III domain. Finally, the specificity of RTL1 towards dsRNA was demonstrated by incubating His-RTL1 with denatured or non-denatured RNA. Indeed, His-RTL1 was able to cleave non-denatured but not denatured <italic>IR71</italic> precursor RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that RTL1 cleaves dsRNA. Nevertheless, His-RTL1 activity appears specific to certain dsRNA. Indeed, the abundant and highly structured <italic>U3</italic> snoRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref029">29</xref>], which is not a siRNA precursor, was not cleaved by His-RTL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>), indicating that RTL1 cleavage activity is sequence- and/or structure-specific, or depends on a cofactor that recognizes certain dsRNA such as siRNA precursors.</p>

<p>Upon virus inoculation, <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA overaccumulates in systemic leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine if this level of RTL1 induction impacts siRNA production, the accumulation of endogenous <italic>TAS2</italic> ta-siRNAs was compared in water (mock)-, TCV-, TVCV-, CMV-, and TYMV-inoculated Col plants. <italic>TAS2</italic> ta-siRNA accumulation was strongly reduced in TYMV-inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This reduction was similar to that observed in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), indicating that the RTL1 level in TYMV-infected plants impacts siRNA production.

These results suggest that despite a similar induction of <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA accumulation during infection by all four viruses, TCV, TVCV, and CMV, but not TYMV, seem to prevent the effect of RTL1 on endogenous siRNA accumulation. To test if TCV, TVCV, and CMV actually block RTL1 activity, the effect of these viruses on the accumulation of endogenous <italic>TAS2</italic> ta-siRNAs was examined in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag#2</italic> plants because these plants constitutively overaccumulate RTL1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and exhibit reduced siRNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). <italic>TAS2</italic> ta-siRNAs accumulated in TCV-, TVCV-, and CMV-inoculated <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag#2</italic> plants at a level near that of TCV-, TVCV-, and CMV-inoculated Col plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), indicating that TCV, TVCV, and CMV block the activity of either virus-induced wild-type RTL1 protein or ectopically expressed RTL1-Flag protein. <italic>TAS2</italic> ta-siRNA accumulation was similarly abolished in mock- and TYMV-inoculated <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag#2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), indicating that TYMV does not block RTL1 activity.</p>

<p>The results above indicate that <italic>RTL1</italic> expression is induced in response to virus infection, but that most viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit RTL1 activity, suggesting that RTL1 could be deleterious for virus replication. It has long been known that most viruses encode proteins that inhibit components of the plant antiviral PTGS defense. These proteins are referred to as VSRs. Until now, inhibition of plant PTGS by VSR proteins was considered sufficient to successfully establish infection. However, our results suggest that viruses also inhibit RTL1 activity, suggesting that inhibition of both RTL1 and PTGS is necessary to successfully establish infection. This hypothesis raised the question of how viruses inhibit RTL1 activity. To address this question, we first tested if VSR proteins were implicated in the inhibition of RTL1 activity. To this end, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves were coinfiltrated with the <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GU-UG</italic> construct and either <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>VSR</italic>, or <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>VSR</italic> constructs. Among the four viruses tested, two, TCV and CMV, encode strong VSRs, P38 and 2b, respectively, whereas TYMV encodes a weak VSR, P69. Given the effect of TVCV on PTGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref034">34</xref>], it likely encodes a VSR as strong as P38; however, the TVCV protein that acts as a VSR has not been identified yet and thus could not be tested here. Whereas <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic>-infiltrated leaves exhibited strongly reduced levels of <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs compared with <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>-infiltrated leaves, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>P38</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>2b</italic>-infiltrated leaves accumulated <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs at a level similar to that of <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>P38</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>2b</italic>-infiltrated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Moreover, leaves infiltrated with <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>P38GA2</italic>, which expresses a defective form of P38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref035">35</xref>], showed reduced levels of <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs similar to <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> infiltrated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). These results indicate that active forms of P38 and 2b are able to prevent RTL1-mediated inhibition of transgene-derived siRNAs. In contrast, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>P69</italic> infiltrated leaves exhibited strongly reduced levels of <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs, similar to <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> infiltrated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), indicating that P69 has no effect on RTL1 activity. To extend our analysis of the effects of VSR proteins, we also tested the effect of the strong VSR P1/HC-Pro encoded by turnip mosaic virus (TuMV, a Potyvirus), knowing that TuMV suppresses PTGS as efficiently as TCV and TVCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref034">34</xref>]. <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1 + 35S</italic>:<italic>P1/HC-Pro</italic>-infiltrated leaves accumulated <italic>GU</italic> siRNAs at a level similar to that of <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>P1/HC-Pro</italic>-infiltrated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), indicating that P1/HC-Pro is as efficient as P38 and 2b in suppressing RTL1 activity. Together, these results suggest that every strong VSR is capable of suppressing RTL1 activity.</p>

<title>RTL1 Overexpression Caused a Severe Aggravation of TYMV-Induced Symptoms</title>
<p>To further examine the biological role of RTL1 in plant-virus interactions, we attempted to compare virus-sensitivity in Col and <italic>rtl1</italic> mutants.

Consistent with the aggravation of symptoms, viral RNA accumulated at higher levels in TYMV-inoculated <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> plants compared with TYMV-inoculated Col (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Inversely, TYMV-derived siRNAs did not accumulate in TYMV-inoculated <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic>, whereas they accumulate at high level in TYMV-inoculated Col (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). These results indicate that, when artificially over-expressed, RTL1 prevents the accumulation of TYMV siRNAs as efficiently as it prevents the accumulation of transgene siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g005">Fig 5</xref>), confirming that TYMV is unable to inhibit RTL1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Therefore, during TYMV infection, RTL1 acts as an antagonist of the plant antiviral PTGS defense, thus promoting virus proliferation and aggravated symptoms in TYMV-inoculated <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1-Flag</italic> plants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Unlike the DICER-type RNAseIII enzymes that produce small RNAs necessary for silencing in a range of eukaryotes, the plant non-DICER RNaseIII enzyme RTL1 does not promote small RNA production but rather represses it. Genome-wide profiling of small RNAs in plants ectopically expressing RTL1 under the control of a strong promoter (<italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic>) revealed that RTL1 inhibits the accumulation of all types of small RNAs normally produced by DCL2, DCL3, or DCL4 from ~6,000 loci. Because RTL1 overexpression does not affect the accumulation of DCL1-dependent conserved miRNAs, which are processed from imperfectly-paired short hairpins, it is likely that RTL1 specifically affects perfectly paired long dsRNA, such as the precursors of ta-siRNAs and p4-siRNAs, which derive from RDR activity, or near-perfectly paired long dsRNA, such as the precursors of young miRNAs and of endoIR-siRNAs. Consistently, in vivo and in vitro assays show that RTL1 cleaves dsRNA. Because siRNAs are almost totally absent in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants where the four DCLs are present, RTL1 likely has a very high affinity for long dsRNA and thus cleaves dsRNA before they enter processing by the DCLs. RTL1 constitutive expression does not result in the accumulation of a novel size class of small RNA, indicating that RTL1 does not act as a DCL enzyme and does not produce small RNA per se. Rather, it likely cleaves long dsRNA precursors into multiple fragments, which subsequently are degraded into nucleotides by 5’-to-3’ and/or 3’-to-5’ exoribonucleases. Exceptionally, RTL1-mediated cleavage of dsRNA precursors can give rise to molecules that are better processed by another DCL than the original dsRNA, likely because these cleavage products are stable and/or adopt a conformation that makes them a better substrate for one DCL. For example, the hairpin located at the 3’UTR of <italic>At3g18145</italic> appears to be a bad substrate for DCL1, resulting in a very low production of the 21 nt miR3440b. In contrast, an abundant production of a 24 nt siRNA species is observed in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s008">S7 Fig</xref>), likely because RTL1-mediated cleavage of <italic>At3g18145</italic> mRNA makes it accessible to DCL3. However, the stabilization of a dsRNA following RTL1-mediated cleavage remains exceptional. Indeed, in <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants, small RNA accumulation is reduced at 6,089 loci whereas it is increased at only 13 loci.</p>
<p>Under laboratory growth conditions, <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA accumulates at very low levels ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref019">19</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002326.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This result explains why siRNAs accumulate in most tissues of wild-type plants, but raises questions about the biological role of RTL1. The fact that RTL1 is conserved in plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002326.s013">S12 Fig</xref>) suggests that it has important functions. Indeed, <italic>rtl1</italic> mutant or <italic>RTL1</italic>-silenced plants have not been identified so far, suggesting that <italic>rtl1</italic> mutants could be impaired in both male and female gamete formation, like <italic>rtl4</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref020">20</xref>]. When ectopically expressed, not only does RTL1 prevent the production of endogenous siRNAs, but it also prevents the production of exogenous siRNAs, indicating that RTL1 generally targets long dsRNA. As such, RTL1 could target dsRNA intermediates of viral replication providing that <italic>RTL1</italic> mRNA is induced during virus infection and RTL1 protein expressed where viruses replicate. We indeed observed that RTL1, but not RTL2 or RTL3, is induced in leaves in response to infection by viruses from four different families, consistent with a possible role of RTL1 in plant–virus interactions. Moreover, consistent with an effect of RTL1 on all types of siRNAs, subcellular localization experiments indicated that RTL1 resides in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, thus allowing a possible interaction of RTL1 with RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. By cleaving dsRNA intermediates of viral replication, RTL1 would therefore act as a second layer of plant antiviral defense in addition to PTGS. PTGS was primarily deciphered in plants that carried silenced transgenes, but it rapidly became obvious that it is an innate mechanism of antiviral defense in plants, flies, and worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref038">38</xref>]. Indeed, a fraction of viral RNA is transformed into siRNAs by Dicer enzymes (DCL2 and DCL4 in plants), which, upon loading onto AGO proteins (AGO1 and AGO2 in plants), target viral RNA for destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref015">15</xref>]. However, this mechanism is rarely efficient to protect plants against infection because most viruses have evolved proteins that suppress PTGS at various steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref036">36</xref>]. These proteins are referred to as VSRs. VSR proteins often exhibit multiple activities directed against different components, substrates, and/or products of the PTGS machinery, making complex the elucidation of their exact effect on PTGS. For example, TCV P38 binds to AGO1, AGO2, and dsRNA, while CMV 2b binds to AGO1 and dsRNA (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref017">17</xref>] and references therein). Moreover, VSR proteins do not all localize to the same subcellular compartments. As a consequence, VSR proteins inhibit PTGS at different levels and with different efficiencies. For example, TYMV P69 has limited effect on PTGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref039">39</xref>], whereas CMV 2b, TCV P38, and TuMV P1/HC-Pro efficiently suppress PTGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref034">34</xref>]. The VSR encoded by TVCV has not been identified yet, but TVCV suppresses PTGS as efficiently as CMV, TCV, and TuMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref034">34</xref>], suggesting that the TVCV VSR is as strong as the CMV, TCV, and TuMV VSRs. Accordingly, TYMV-infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants exhibit mild symptoms, whereas CMV, TCV, TuMV, and TVCV cause severe symptoms on this plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref039">39</xref>]. These results collectively suggest that the strength of a VSR determines the efficiency of infection by the corresponding virus. Given that VSR proteins affect several endogenous functions in addition to PTGS (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref017">17</xref>] and references therein), the outcome of infection could also depend on the effect of VSRs on these endogenous functions. Here, we report that the strong VSRs P38, P1/HC-Pro, and 2b inhibit the activity of the previously uncharacterized RNaseIII RTL1. These results support the hypothesis that RTL1 has evolved as an inducible antiviral plant defense, and that viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit or counteract RTL1 activity like they have evolved strategies to inhibit PTGS. Remarkably, inhibition of RTL1 activity and inhibition of plant PTGS defense appear to rely on the same viral proteins. Whether VSR proteins inhibit PTGS and RTL1 by different or similar mechanisms remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Viruses such as TYMV, which encodes a VSR that has very weak activity against PTGS and no visible effect on RTL1 activity, seem to have evolved a different strategy to escape RTL1. In fact, RTL1 appears to help TYMV to achieve a successful infection. Indeed, <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants exhibit hypersusceptibility to infection by TYMV. This is probably due to the fact that TYMV-infected <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants lack TYMV-derived siRNAs, as they lack other siRNAs due to the action of RTL1. As such, TYMV-derived siRNAs cannot target TYMV RNAs for destruction by PTGS. Consistently, TYMV RNAs overaccumulate in TYMV-infected <italic>35S</italic>:<italic>RTL1</italic> plants. How do TYMV dsRNA replication intermediates escape RTL1? One possibility is that TYMV replicates in subcellular compartments from which RTL1 is excluded. Supporting this hypothesis, TYMV replicates in virus-induced chloroplastic membrane vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002326.ref040">40</xref>]. Another possibility is that TYMV dsRNA replication intermediates simply are not substrates for RTL1 due to particular structure and/or sequence. Therefore, all that RTL1 could do is cleave RDR6-derived TYMV dsRNA, thus preventing the production of TYMV siRNAs that could target TYMV RNA for destruction, resulting in aggravated symptoms in plants that express RTL1.</p>
<p>To conclude, our study has revealed a novel plant protein involved in host–virus interactions. RTL1 likely has evolved as an inducible actor of the cellular defenses that help plants to fight against viruses, likely by degrading dsRNA intermediates of virus replication. However, viruses like CMV, TCV, TuMV, and TVCV have evolved strategies to inhibit RTL1 activity and antiviral PTGS at the same time. In other cases, like for TYMV, the virus does not appear to impede RTL1 activity, and, consequently, RTL1 competes with antiviral PTGS to degrade viral-derived dsRNA that would normally be processed to siRNAs. As such, the strong PTGS defense pathway is sabotaged and TYMV is able to replicate to some extent, suggesting the RTL1-mediated cleavage of viral dsRNAs is less effective at destroying viral RNAs than PTGS, likely due to the absence of siRNA amplification. Further experiments will be required to address the precise action of RTL1 towards each virus.</p>
