<abstract>
<p>Genome editing occurs in the context of chromatin, which is heterogeneous in structure and function across the genome. Chromatin heterogeneity is thought to affect genome editing efficiency, but this has been challenging to quantify due to the presence of confounding variables. Here, we develop a method that exploits the allele-specific chromatin status of imprinted genes in order to address this problem in cycling mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Because maternal and paternal alleles of imprinted genes have identical DNA sequence and are situated in the same nucleus, allele-specific differences in the frequency and spectrum of mutations induced by CRISPR-Cas9 can be unequivocally attributed to epigenetic mechanisms. We found that heterochromatin can impede mutagenesis, but to a degree that depends on other key experimental parameters. Mutagenesis was impeded by up to 7-fold when Cas9 exposure was brief and when intracellular Cas9 expression was low. In contrast, the outcome of mutagenic DNA repair was unaffected by chromatin state, with similar efficiencies of homology-directed repair (HDR) and deletion spectra on maternal and paternal chromosomes. Combined, our data show that heterochromatin imposes a permeable barrier that influences the kinetics, but not the endpoint, of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and suggest that therapeutic applications involving low-level Cas9 exposure will be particularly affected by chromatin status.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Genomic imprinting is a developmental process through which either the maternally or paternally derived allele of a gene is epigenetically silenced. Imprinting has served as a model system to understand the mechanisms through which chromatin modifications can influence transcriptional regulation; comparisons between active and repressed alleles in the same cell nucleus provide an internal control for the effects of DNA sequence properties and exposure to <italic>trans</italic>-regulators (elements that modify distant genes). Here, we have exploited these features in order to understand how chromatin modifications influence genome editing with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system. By comparing the frequency and spectrum of Cas9-induced genome edits on maternal versus paternal alleles of imprinted genes, we discovered experimental conditions that determine whether chromatin modifications have a large or small effect on the outcome of genome editing procedures. We show that chromatin state does not affect the size of deletions and insertions or their relative frequency compared to precise genome edits specified by an oligonucleotide donor template. However, repressed chromatin inhibits the rate at which mutations form, particularly when the intracellular concentration of Cas9 is low. At longer exposure times, mutation frequencies on repressed versus active alleles are similar. Collectively, our data suggest that chromatin status affects the kinetics but not the endpoint of genome editing experiments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) is an RNA-guided endonuclease involved in bacterial adaptive immunity, which has been repurposed as a highly efficient tool for eukaryotic genome editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref003">3</xref>]. In its natural form, Cas9 protein associates with a duplex of two RNA molecules: the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which recognises a short section of target DNA (the ‘protospacer’), and a <italic>trans</italic>-activating crRNA, which acts as a scaffold to link the crRNA and Cas9 endonuclease. Most genome editing applications use a single guide RNA molecule (sgRNA) resulting from an engineered fusion of these two components. After target DNA cleavage, mutations arise through the action of cellular DNA repair pathways. Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ; including both classical and microhomology-mediated pathways) can yield short insertions and deletions (InDels) suitable for gene knockout, whereas homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways utilise exogenous donor templates to introduce precise sequence changes.</p>
<p>It is well established that genetic properties of the genomic target site and sgRNA molecule have a significant effect on the efficiency of CRISPR mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref006">6</xref>]. However, Cas9, being prokaryotic in origin, did not evolve to cope with the complex chromatinised environment of the eukaryotic genome. Despite prior studies in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref015">15</xref>], the extent to which epigenetic properties of the target site—including DNA and histone modifications—influence mutation frequency and DNA repair outcome remains incompletely understood. Stably positioned nucleosomes act as a barrier to Cas9 binding and function on synthetic chromatin fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref011">11</xref>], and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref015">15</xref>], yet catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) can open previously inaccessible regions of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref017">17</xref>]. It has been reported that some sgRNAs show reduced activity within heterochromatin whereas others do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref014">14</xref>]. The reasons behind this paradox are unclear but presumably involve other experimental variables that modify the influence of chromatin on CRISPR activity. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that double strand break (DSB) repair is influenced by the chromatin environment in which DSBs arise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref022">22</xref>], and DSB repair is central to the mechanism of genome editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref024">24</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether preexisting epigenetic properties of the target site impact upon the specific sequence changes that arise following Cas9 cleavage.</p>
<p>Genomic imprinting is a natural epigenetic process in which either the maternal or paternally derived copy of a gene is transcriptionally silenced. Essential regulatory elements within imprinted domains called ‘imprinting control regions’ undergo differential methylation at CpG dinucleotides during male and female gametogenesis. This leads to the establishment of monoallelic domains of heterochromatin in the early embryo that are maintained throughout somatic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref025">25</xref>]. These imprinted alleles carry all known hallmarks of constitutive heterochromatin, including post-translational histone modifications (H3K9me3, H4K20me3, histone hypoacetylation) and heterochromatin binding proteins (HP1γ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Genomic imprinting has provided numerous insights into mechanisms of transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref030">30</xref>]. Because active and silent alleles of imprinted loci have an identical DNA sequence, chromosomal position, and potential exposure to diffusible regulators, allele-specific chromatin modifications must be sufficient to account for their allele-specific expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref031">31</xref>]. Based on this principle, we postulated that genomic imprinting could be used to provide new insights into the influence of chromatin modifications on targeted mutagenesis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines were derived from male F1 hybrid blastocysts of inter-subspecies crosses between (C57BL6/J [B6]) and the <italic>Mus musculus molossinus</italic> inbred strain JF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). These cells are heterozygous for strain-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref032">32</xref>], which serve as genetic markers that distinguish maternal and paternal chromosomes. To control for possible genetic effects on mutagenesis arising from SNPs, we derived mESCs from reciprocal crosses (B6 female × JF1 male [B×J], and JF1 female × B6 male [J×B]) and used both cell lines in parallel wherever possible. Although mESCs show globally reduced CpG methylation compared to primary somatic cells, the effects on imprinted regions were minimised by using male (XY) cells cultured in serum-free conditions. Unless otherwise stated, cells were cultured in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3β but not MEK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<p>(A) Schematic outlining the experimental workflow. Throughout the text, F1 hybrid cell lines are depicted with the maternal strain denoted before the paternal strain (i.e., In B×J: B is maternal and J paternal). sgRNAs are designed to cleave approximately 40–100 bp from a heterozygous SNP within imprinted chromatin (open and closed circles). MiSeq amplicons span both the SNP and site of mutation, which allows simultaneous assessment of genome editing outcome and parental allele at high-throughput.

<p>We targeted three maternally imprinted CpG islands: <italic>KvDMR1</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>KvDMR</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), <italic>Impact</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), and <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). To determine whether these loci had distinct epigenetic configurations on maternal and paternal alleles in B×J and J×B mESCs, we performed allele-specific DNase-I hypersensitivity assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s002">S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3B</xref> Figs) as well as allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1C, S1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s002">S2C, S2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3C and S3D</xref> Figs). In each case, paternally derived alleles were substantially more sensitive to DNase-I digestion, whereas maternal alleles were highly enriched for heterochromatin marks. Nonetheless, in some cases, loss of imprinting (LOI) was evident from incomplete allelic enrichment of histone modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3D Fig</xref>) and incomplete depletion of paternal alleles by DNase-I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). During subsequent editing experiments, we therefore quantified CpG methylation levels as a biomarker of LOI at the target site in mock-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We designed three different sgRNAs to target protospacer sequences within KvDMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). mESCs were transfected with Cas9 and individual sgRNAs expressed from plasmid pX459v2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref035">35</xref>], together with a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor template that introduced point mutations to prevent re-cutting following HDR. Transfected cells were selected in puromycin and collected as a pool 96 hours after transfection. Editing was quantified by Illumina sequencing of PCR amplicons spanning both the site of cleavage and an allelic SNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1A Fig</xref>, for detailed experimental protocols see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref>). This allowed the outcome of mutagenic repair to be determined, at the nucleotide level, separately on maternal and paternal chromosomes.</p>
<p>We first compared the frequency of all edits, including InDels and point mutations introduced from ssODN donors, on maternal versus paternal alleles. All three sgRNAs yielded more mutations on the active paternal allele compared to the repressed maternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>), whereas a control, nonimprinted locus (<italic>NCAPH</italic>) showed no such allelic bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). The effect of imprinted chromatin was subtle in this context: 1.1- to 1.6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>), even in B×J cells in which imprinting was completely maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To ensure that the observed bias in allele-specific mutation frequency could be attributed to chromatin modifications, we took advantage of the stochastic LOI reported to occur in mESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref036">36</xref>]. In a series of six triplicate mutagenesis experiments targeting three imprinted loci (sgKVDMR1, sgImpact, sg<italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic>) in two mESC lines, we observed a significant correlation between the degree of imprinted CpG methylation in mock-transfected cells and the degree of allele-specific mutation bias (r = 0.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To experimentally induce LOI, a B×J cell line was cultured to high passage (p23) in the presence of MEK inhibitors (‘2i’) and vitamin C, which have been reported to induce global hypomethylation in mESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref037">37</xref>]. CpG methylation was unaffected at the <italic>KvDMR</italic> locus, slightly reduced at <italic>Impact</italic>, and completely lost at <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> in late passage compared to early passage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Accordingly, allele-specific mutation bias was lost at <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> but not at the <italic>KvDMR</italic> or <italic>Impact</italic> target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). This shows that chromatin modifications are sufficient to influence the frequency of mutations induced by CRISPR-Cas9 on identical target sites in the same cell nucleus, but the effects are typically subtle (&lt;2-fold) in cells harvested 96 hours following plasmid transfection.</p>

<p>We next considered whether common experimental variables affect the degree to which modified chromatin impedes mutagenesis, reasoning that CRISPR might less efficiently overcome the heterochromatin barrier when the intracellular concentration of Cas9 is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref038">38</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, KvDMR sgRNA#3 was expressed from plasmid pX458, in which Cas9 is fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) via a self-cleaving 2A peptide. eGFP levels therefore serve as a reporter of Cas9 translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Flow cytometry revealed that Cas9 translation levels were highly variable between cells at 24 hours post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into three categories based on eGFP fluorescence and then collected either immediately (24 hours, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) or following an additional 3 days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4</xref>). B×J cells expressing Cas9 at low levels showed a profound (5.3-fold) reduction in mutation frequency on the silent maternal compared to the active paternal allele after 4 days of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). At intermediate levels of Cas9-eGFP expression, the mutational bias was moderate (2.6-fold), whereas high expression yielded only subtle differences between alleles (approximately 1.2-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). J×B cells showed the same trend, but mutations on the maternal allele were more frequent, consistent with approximately 30% LOI in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Heterochromatin therefore impedes mutagenesis to a greater extent when the intracellular concentration of Cas9 is low.</p>

<p>Single particle tracking experiments have shown that the efficiency of target searching by dCas9 is reduced within heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref009">9</xref>]. Whether this impacts upon mutagenesis with Cas9 nuclease was not tested. To determine whether heterochromatin delays mutation kinetics, we initially targeted the <italic>Impact</italic> imprinted locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), using a highly active sgRNA (sgImpact) that yielded similar frequencies of mutation on maternal and paternal alleles after 96 hours of exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). B×J cells were collected at 4-hour intervals following transfection, after which allele-specific mutagenesis was quantified as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). As expected, the frequency of mutations across both alleles increased steadily from 8 hours to 48 hours following transfection, but mutations were more skewed towards the active paternal allele at earlier compared to later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Using sgRNAs targeting two additional imprinted loci (sgKvDMR#1 [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1 Fig</xref>] and sgInpp5f_v2 [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3 Fig</xref>]), we observed stronger skewing towards allelic target sites within euchromatin at early (16-hour) compared to later (96-hour) time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g005">Fig 5C–5F</xref>). This effect was most striking in cells exposed to high concentrations of Cas9, for which a large majority (78%) of mutations present in euchromatin following 96 hours of exposure were found to occur within the first 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g005">Fig 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

<p>Allele-specific ChIP experiments were conducted to quantify dCas9 occupancy after targeting to the <italic>Impact</italic> and <italic>KvDMR</italic> imprinted loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). This revealed an approximately 2-fold enrichment on euchromatic alleles in both cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s005">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>). Similar levels of enrichment for the euchromatic allele were evident from 8 hours post transfection, substantially before the majority of mutations arise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), through to 96 hours. We conclude that heterochromatin impairs the kinetics of mutagenesis by inhibiting Cas9 occupancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), and to a degree that depends on the level of intracellular Cas9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, target sites within heterochromatin ultimately reach similar frequencies of mutation upon sustained CRISPR exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The repair of DSBs induced by Cas9-independent routes is thought to be influenced by the preexisting chromatin environment at the site of cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref022">22</xref>]. However, whether DNA accessibility and/or epigenetic modification of DNA and histone proteins can influence the outcome of CRISPR mutagenesis, particularly the frequency of InDels arising via NHEJ versus precise edits templated by exogenous nucleic acid donors (HDR), is not known. Imprinted genes provide an ideal system with which to address this question.</p>
<p>For five sgRNAs targeting imprinted heterochromatin, mutational profiles were calculated separately from sequencing reads originating from maternal (repressed) versus paternal (active) alleles (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref>). No consistent allelic biases were evident in the ratio of InDels versus HDR-derived edits at 4 days post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), but the rate of HDR varied by up to 3-fold between loci. This suggests that DNA sequence features of the target and HDR template molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref039">39</xref>] are more important than epigenetic properties in determining HDR efficiency. It is important to stress that our assay is designed to detect DNA sequence changes rather than DSB repair and cannot, in its current form, measure nonmutagenic repair that does not lead to genome edits (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Discussion</xref>). Nonetheless, the data suggest that the relative frequency of InDels versus HDR-derived edits, a key parameter in genome editing experiments, is not substantially affected by the preexisting state of local chromatin. We note that a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> found that DSB repair kinetics and pathway choice were similar in euchromatin versus heterochromatin following I-SceI cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref040">40</xref>].</p>

<p>Next, we asked whether chromatin modifications influenced the spectrum and frequency of different InDel mutation classes produced via NHEJ. In line with a recent large-scale deep sequencing study of InDels induced by Cas9 in cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref024">24</xref>], we found that each sgRNA produced its own characteristic InDel pattern, with the top five recurrent mutations comprising 30% to 60% of all sequencing reads in cells collected 96 hours following transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The same mutations recurred on maternal and paternal chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) despite these allelic target sites starting in very different epigenetic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3</xref> Figs). Thus, neither the relative frequency of InDels versus HDR edits nor the spectrum of different InDels is substantially affected by the presence of heterochromatin at a CRISPR target site.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have used the classical epigenetic model system of genomic imprinting to determine the effect of chromatin context on CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. This internally controlled approach allowed us to identify key experimental parameters (intracellular Cas9 expression level and duration of exposure) that determine the extent to which repressed chromatin impairs mutagenesis. Our findings are consistent with and extend those of previous studies in this area. The inhibitory effect of nucleosomes on Cas9 binding and cleavage is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref011">11</xref>], and the sgRNAs used in this study targeted regions of allele-specific DNAse hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s001">S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s002">S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s003">S3B</xref> Figs). On hypersensitive alleles, nucleosome–DNA interactions are less stable due to chromatin remodelling activities associated with RNA Polymerase II transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref041">41</xref>]. It is also possible that DNA methylation can directly influence Cas9 binding and/or cleavage, and future studies will be required to address this possibility in vitro.</p>
<p>We propose that the dynamic nature of chromatin at these sites would provide more opportunities for Cas9 complexes to bind and cleave their targets per unit of time. Conversely, mutations accumulate more slowly in heterochromatin, where nucleosomes marked by H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 more effectively occlude Cas9 complexes during the target search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref009">9</xref>]. Mutagenesis still occurs within heterochromatin, albeit at a slower rate, presumably due to residual nucleosome breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref011">11</xref>] and remodelling associated with DNA replication. Future experiments should focus on post-mitotic cells, both to determine whether heterochromatin exerts a greater effect on mutagenesis in the absence of DNA replication as well as to remove the potentially confounding effect of cell cycle stage on DNA repair outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Elevated concentrations of Cas9 increase the likelihood of mutation through mass action: an effect that we observed in both heterochromatin and euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g004">Fig 4</xref>), and which caused mutagenesis to reach saturation more rapidly. Under conditions of low Cas9 expression and brief exposure in which no LOI occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005595.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), heterochromatin impeded mutagenesis by more than 6-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In practical terms, our findings suggest that chromatin state is a particularly important consideration during procedures in which the level of Cas9 exposure is kept low. This would be relevant in a clinical setting, in which it is desirable to minimise exposure in order to avoid undesirable off-target mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>We also addressed, to our knowledge for the first time, whether local chromatin state influences the relative frequency of precise CRISPR-Cas9 genome edits (i.e., templated from exogenous single-stranded donor DNA) versus InDels. We found that this important aspect of genome editing was not significantly different between heterochromatin and euchromatin. This is somewhat surprising in light of prior reports that chromatin modifications influence DSB repair pathway choice in other contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref044">44</xref>]. However, our study differs from these prior reports in several important ways. Firstly, we used Cas9 to introduce DSBs rather than restriction enzymes or ionising radiation. It is possible that localised chromatin remodelling events associated with Cas9 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref017">17</xref>] are sufficient to overcome any prior differences in chromatin state at imprinted loci, which might otherwise influence the outcome of DNA repair. Secondly, it has been suggested that the repair of Cas9-derived DSBs could occur with unusually slow kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref045">45</xref>], possibly due to the presence of an R-loop proximal to the broken ends. Caution should therefore be exercised when generalizing findings from Cas9-induced breaks to those arising from other sources. Thirdly, our assay was designed to quantify genome editing rather than DSB repair and fails to report on nonmutagenic breaks repaired via NHEJ without end resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref046">46</xref>] or homologous recombination from the sister chromatid. Although our data show that the preexisting chromatin status does not affect the spectrum of mutations induced during genome editing, we emphasise that they do not directly assess the influence of chromatin on repair pathway choice.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that allele-specific epigenetic model systems such as genomic imprinting can provide new insights into mechanisms of genome editing in a physiological setting. Given the expanding range of synthetic DNA binding proteins now used in research, biotechnology, and medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref051">51</xref>], this approach can provide further insights into their mode of interaction with chromatin in vivo. A strength of our assay is that it allows the influence of chromatin modifications to be assessed independently from the underlying DNA sequence. However, it is important to keep in mind that imprinted heterochromatin spans small genomic distances (approximately 2–10 kb) and is embedded within genomic euchromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref026">26</xref>], similar to dispersed transposon sequences. Most genomic heterochromatin is assembled upon larger regions of clustered repeats such as pericentromeres and telomeres, in which the unusual DNA sequence properties are likely to influence target recognition and repair independently of chromatin status. Whether mechanisms of genome editing within imprinted heterochromatin reflect those in pericentromeric regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref052">52</xref>] therefore remains to be seen. In the future, it will be of interest to extend this study to assess other allele-specific chromatin states, such as transcribed versus nontranscribed imprinted gene bodies, and targets on the active versus inactive X chromosome.</p>

<title>Locus-specific amplification and MiSeq library preparation</title>
<p>DNA was isolated from edited cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) with RNAse treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each biological replicate used 50 ng of template DNA, corresponding to 8,333 diploid genomes. Adaptors and barcodes necessary for multiplexed high-throughput amplicon sequencing were added using a two-round PCR procedure. In the first round, locus-specific primers were designed to span regions encompassing both the editing site and an allelic SNP, which allowed the origin of each sequence read to be traced to the maternal or paternal allele. First-round primers contained 5′ extensions with a random hexamer, binding sites for Illumina sequencing primers, and binding sites for universal primers necessary for the second round of cycling. Edited loci were amplified for 25 cycles using High Fidelity Phusion Polymerase (NEB). PCR products were purified using AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 50 μL. A total of 10 μL of eluate was taken forward to a second round of PCR for eight cycles. The second round of PCR used universal primers that contained unique indices based on the i5 and i7 sequences from the Nextera library prep kit (Illumina).

<p>Trimmed and de-duplicated read pairs were aligned to mouse genome build GRCm38 using BWA version 0.7.12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref058">58</xref>]. Read pairs were extracted by the expected genomic region for each experiment and were assigned to the C57BL/6J or JF1 chromosome based on nucleotide identity at known polymorphic SNPs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molossinus.lab.nig.ac.jp/msmdb/index.jsp" xlink:type="simple">http://molossinus.lab.nig.ac.jp/msmdb/index.jsp</ext-link>). Read pairs containing mutations originating from HDR were identified based on the expected sequence changes introduced from the oligonucleotide donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005595.s009">S3 Data</xref>), whereas read pairs containing InDels within 10 bp of the cleavage site were identified as originating from fragments that had undergone NHEJ. Read pairs with evidence of neither were labelled as wild type. Indel length and type (insertion or deletion) were extracted from the NHEJ read pairs via a custom Perl script.</p>

<title>Bisulphite sequencing of unedited samples</title>
<p>Trimmed and de-duplicated read pairs were aligned to the bisulphite conversion indexed mouse genome build GRCm38 using Bismark version 0.16.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref059">59</xref>] with Bowtie version 2.2.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005595.ref060">60</xref>]. Read pairs that did not align were then separated, and each end of the pair was aligned as single end reads. The three resulting alignments were merged. Read pairs were extracted by the expected genomic region for each experiment. The number of methylated CpGs in each read pair was counted using a custom Perl script examining the XM tag for each read in the relevant BAM file. Because not all sequencing amplicons contained an informative SNP to distinguish parental alleles, we report total methylation levels across both alleles and do not distinguish maternal from paternal strands. All sequencing data have been deposited in the SRA under project accession PRJNA421037.</p>

<title>The same InDel classes recur in heterochromatin and euchromatin 96 hours post transfection.</title>
<p>The size and frequency of the top five most common InDels (broken down by parental allele) produced by four different sgRNAs targeting imprinted heterochromatin. Edited genomic DNA was extracted 4 days following transfection with sgRNAs targeting the KvDMR (panels A and B), <italic>Impact</italic> (panel C), and Inpp5f_v2 (panel D) imprinted loci in B×J (left) and J×B (right) cells. Deletion sizes are depicted against the scale bar at the top of each panel, and the number of inserted bases is indicated next to the blue rectangle. Note that any of four possible nucleotides can theoretically be inserted; therefore, more than one +1 insertion was observed in some instances. The horizontal red line denotes the predicted cleavage site, and the colour key for all panels is situated at the bottom left of the figure. The fraction of Indels was calculated as the number of reads corresponding to each specific mutation class, expressed as a proportion of all InDel-containing reads. The fraction of hypermethylated strands in mock-transfected cells is indicated below each plot.
