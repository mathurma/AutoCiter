<abstract>
<p>16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (<bold>SP</bold>arse <bold>I</bold>nvers<bold>E</bold> <bold>C</bold>ovariance Estimation for <bold>E</bold>cological <bold>A</bold>ssociation <bold>I</bold>nference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genomic survey of microbes by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics has inspired appreciation for the role of complex communities in diverse ecosystems. However, due to the unique properties of community composition data, standard data analysis tools are likely to produce statistical artifacts. For a typical experiment studying microbial ecosystems these artifacts can lead to erroneous conclusions about patterns of associations between microbial taxa. We developed a new procedure that seeks to infer ecological associations between microbial populations, by 1) taking advantage of the proportionality invariance of relative abundance data and 2) making assumptions about the underlying network structure when the number of taxa in the dataset is larger than the number of sampled communities. Additionally, we employed a novel tool to generate biologically plausible synthetic data and objectively benchmark current association inference tools. Finally, we tested our procedures on a large-scale 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset sampled from the human gut.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low-cost metagenomic and amplicon-based sequencing promises to make the resolution of complex interactions between microbial populations and their surrounding environment a routine component of observational ecology and experimental biology. Indeed, large-scale data collection efforts (such as Earth Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref001">1</xref>], the Human Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref002">2</xref>], and the American Gut Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref003">3</xref>]) bring an ever-increasing number of samples from soil, marine and animal-associated microbiota to the public domain. Recent research efforts in ecology, statistics, and computational biology have been aimed at reliably inferring novel biological insights and testable hypotheses from population abundances and phylogenies. Classic objectives in community ecology include, (i) the accurate estimation of the number of taxa (observed and unobserved) from microbial studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref004">4</xref>] and, related to that, (ii) the estimation of community diversity within and across different habitats from the modeled population counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref005">5</xref>]. Moreover, some microbial compositions appear to form distinct clusters, leading to the concept of enterotypes, or ecological steady states in the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref006">6</xref>], but their existence has not been established with certainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref007">7</xref>]. Another aim of recent studies is the elucidation of connections between microbes and environmental or host covariates. Examples include a novel statistical regression framework for relating microbiome compositions and covariates in the context of nutrient intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref008">8</xref>], observations that microbiome compositions strongly correlate with disease status in new-onset Crohn’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>], and the connections between helminth infection and the microbiome diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>One goal of microbiome studies is the accurate inference of microbial ecological interactions from population-level data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref011">11</xref>]. ‘Interactions’ are inferred by detecting significant (typically non-directional) associations between sampled populations, e.g., by measuring frequency of co-occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref013">13</xref>]. Microbiota are measured by profiling variable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. These regions are amplified, sequenced, and the resulting reads are then grouped into common Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and quantified, with OTU counts serving as a proxy to the underlying microbial populations’ abundances. Knowledge of interaction networks (here, a measure of microbial association) provides a foundation to predictively model the interplay between environment and microbial populations. A recent example is the successful construction of a dynamic differential equation model to describe the primary succession of intestinal microbiota in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref014">14</xref>]. A commonly used tool to infer a network is correlation analysis; that is computing Pearson’s correlation coefficient among all pairs of OTU samples, and an interaction between microbes is assumed when the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is sufficiently high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>However, applying traditional correlation analysis to amplicon surveys of microbial population data is likely to yield spurious results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>]. To limit experimental biases due to sampling depth, OTU count data is typically transformed by normalizing each OTU count to the total sum of counts in the sample. Thus, communities of microbial relative abundances, termed compositions, are not independent, and classical correlation analysis may fail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref018">18</xref>]. Recent methods such as Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>] and Compositionally Corrected by REnormalization and PErmutation (CCREPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref019">19</xref>] are designed to account for these compositional biases and represent the state of the art in the field. Yet, it is not clear that correlation is the proper measure of association. For example, correlations can arise between OTUs that are indirectly connected in an ecological network (we expand on this point below).</p>
<p>Dimensionality poses another challenge to statistical analysis of microbiome studies, as the number of measured OTUs <italic>p</italic> is on the order of hundreds to thousands whereas the number of samples <italic>n</italic> generally ranges from tens to hundreds. This implies that any meaningful interaction inference scheme must operate in the underdetermined data regime (<italic>p</italic> &gt; <italic>n</italic>), which is viable only if additional assumptions about the interaction network can be made. As technological developments lead to greater sequencing depths, new computational methods that address the (<italic>p</italic> &gt; <italic>n</italic>) challenge will become increasingly important.</p>
<p>In the present work, we present a novel strategy to infer networks from (potentially high-dimensional) community composition data. We introduce SPIEC-EASI (<bold>SP</bold>arse <bold>I</bold>nvers<bold>E</bold> <bold>C</bold>ovariance Estimation for <bold>E</bold>cological <bold>AS</bold>sociation <bold>I</bold>nference, pronounced <italic>speakeasy</italic>), a new statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks and generation of realistic synthetic data. SPIEC-EASI inference comprises two steps: First, a transformation from the field of compositional data analysis is applied to the OTU data. Second, SPIEC-EASI estimates the interaction graph from the transformed data using one of two methods: (i) neighborhood selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref021">21</xref>] and (ii) sparse inverse covariance selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref023">23</xref>]. Unlike empirical correlation or covariance estimation, used in SparCC and CCREPE, our pipeline seeks to infer an underlying graphical model using the concept of conditional independence.</p>
<p>Informally, two nodes (e.g. OTUs) are conditionally independent if, given the state (e.g. abundance) of all other nodes in the network, neither node provides additional information about the state of the other. A link between any two nodes in the graphical model implies that the OTU abundances are not conditionally independent and that there is a (linear) relationship between them that cannot be better explained by an alternate network wiring. In this way, our method avoids detection of correlated but indirectly connected OTUs, thus ensuring parsimony of the resulting network model (for more detail, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This model is an undirected graph where links between nodes represent signed associations between OTUs. The use of graphical models has gained considerable popularity in network biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref026">26</xref>] and, more recently, in structural biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref027">27</xref>], particularly to correct for transitive correlations in protein structure prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title>Conditional independence vs correlation analysis for a toy dataset.</title>
<p>In an ecosystem, the abundance of any OTU is potentially dependent on the abundances of other OTUs in the ecological network. Here, we simulate abundances from a network where OTU 3 directly influences (via some set of biological mechanisms) the abundances of OTUs 1, 2 and 4 (<bold>a</bold>). The inference goal here is to recover the underlying network from the simulated data. <bold>b</bold>) Absolute abundances of these four OTUs were drawn from a negative-binomial distribution across 500 samples according to the true network (as described in the Methods section). <bold>c</bold>) Computing all pairwise Pearson correlation yields a symmetric matrix showing patterns of association (positive correlations are green and negative are red). We thresholded entries of the correlation matrix to generate relevance networks. <bold>d</bold>) A threshold at <italic>ρ</italic> ≥ ∣0.35∣ (represented by dashed and solid edges) results in a network in which OTU 3 is connected to all other OTUs with an additional connection between OTU 2 and OTU 4. A more stringent threshold at <italic>ρ</italic> ≥ ∣0.5∣, results in a sparser relevance network (notably missing the edge between OTU 3 and OTU 1), and is represented in <bold>d</bold> by solid edges only. Importantly, no single threshold recovers the true underlying hub topology. <bold>e</bold>) The inverse sample covariance matrix yields a symmetric matrix where entries are approximately zero if the corresponding OTU pairs are conditionally independent. The network (<bold>f</bold>) inferred from the non-zero entries (colored in blue in <bold>e</bold>) identifies the correct hub network. Thus, it is possible to choose a threshold for the sample inverse covariance that faithfully recovers the true network. Such a threshold is not guaranteed to exist for correlation or covariance (the metric used by SparCC and CCREPE). Intuitively, this is because simultaneous direct connections can induce strong correlations between nodes that do not have direct relationships (e.g. OTU 2-4). Conversely, weak correlations can arise between directly connected nodes (e.g. OTU 1-3). Although correlation is a useful measure of association in many contexts, it is a pairwise metric and therefore limited in a multivariate setting. On the other hand, SPIEC-EASI’s estimate of entries in the inverse covariance matrix depend on the conditional states of all available nodes. This feature helps SPIEC-EASI avoid detection of indirect network interactions.</p>

<p>To properly benchmark our inference scheme and compare its performance with other state-of-the-art schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>], SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a synthetic data generation routine, which generates realistic synthetic OTU data from networks with diverse topologies. This is significant because, to date, (i) no experimentally verified set of “gold-standard” microbial interactions exists, (ii) previous synthetic benchmark data do not accurately reflect the actual properties of microbiome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>], and (iii) theoretical and empirical work from high-dimensional statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref031">31</xref>] suggests that network topology can strongly impact network recovery and performance and thus must be considered in the design of synthetic datasets.</p>
<p>We show that SPIEC-EASI is a scalable inference engine that (i) yields superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art methods in terms of interaction recovery and network features in a diverse set of realistic synthetic benchmark scenarios, (ii) provides the most stable and reproducible network when applied to real data, and (iii) reliably estimates an invertible covariance matrix which can be used for additional downstream statistical analysis. In agreement with statistical theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref029">29</xref>], inference on the synthetic datasets demonstrates that the degree distribution of the underlying network has the largest effect on performance, and this effect is observed across all methods tested. SPIEC-EASI network inference applied to actual data from the American Gut Project (AGP) shows (i) that clusters of strongly connected components are likely to contain OTUs with common family membership and (ii) that actual gut microbial networks are likely composites of archetypical network topologies. In the Materials and Methods section, we present statistical and computational aspects of SPIEC-EASI. We then benchmark SPIEC-EASI, comparing it to current inference schemes using synthetic data. We then apply SPIEC-EASI to measurements available from the AGP database. The SPIEC-EASI pipeline is implemented in the R package [SpiecEasi] freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi">https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi</ext-link>.

<title>Workflow of the SPIEC-EASI pipeline.</title>
<p>The SPIEC-EASI pipeline consists of two independent parts for <bold>a</bold>) synthetic data generation and <bold>b</bold>) network inference. <bold>a</bold>) Synthetic data generation requires an OTU count table and a user-selected network topology. Internally, the parameters of a statistical distribution (the zero-inflated Negative binomial model is suggested) are fit to the OTU marginals of the real data, and are combined with the randomly-generated network in the Normal to Anything (NORTA) approach to generate correlated count data. <bold>b</bold>) Network inference proceeds in three stages on synthetic or real OTU count data: First, data is pre-procssed and centered log-ratio (CLR) transformed to ensure compositional robustness. Next, the user selects one of two graphical model inference procedures: 1) Neighborhood selection (the MB method) or 2) inverse covariance selection (the glasso method). SPIEC-EASI network inference assumes that the underlying network is sparse. We infer the correct model sparseness by the Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS), which involves random subsampling of the dataset to find a network with low variability in the selected set of edges. SPIEC-EASI outputs include an ecological network (from the non-zero entries of the inverse covariance network) and an invertible covariance matrix. If the network was inferred from synthetic data, it can be compared with the input network to assess inference quality.</p>

<p>Major advances in the statistical analysis of compositional data were achieved by Aitchison in the 1980’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref034">34</xref>].

<title>Inference of microbial associations from microbial abundance datasets</title>
<p>Our key objective is to learn a network of pairwise taxon-taxon associations (putative interactions) from clr-transformed microbiome compositions <italic>Z</italic> ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>n</italic>×<italic>p</italic></sup>. We represent the network as an undirected, weighted graph 𝓖 = (<italic>V</italic>, <italic>E</italic>), where the vertex set <italic>V</italic> = {<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>, …, <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>} represents the <italic>p</italic> taxa (e.g., OTUs) and the edge set <italic>E</italic> ⊂ <italic>V</italic> × <italic>V</italic> the possible associations among them. Our formal approach is to learn a probabilistic graphical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref035">35</xref>] (i) that is consistent with the observed data and (ii) for which the (unknown) graph 𝓖 encodes the conditional dependence structure between the random variables (in our case, the observed taxa). Graphical models over undirected graphs (also known as Markov networks or Markov Random Fields) have a straightforward distributional interpretation when the data are drawn from a probability distribution <italic>π</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) that belongs to an exponential family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref037">37</xref>]. For example, when the data are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution <italic>π</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) = 𝓝(<italic>x</italic>∣<italic>μ</italic>, Σ) with mean <italic>μ</italic> and covariance Σ, the non-zero elements of the off-diagonal entries of the inverse covariance matrix Θ = Σ<sup>−1</sup>, also termed the precision matrix, defines the adjacency matrix of the graph 𝓖 and thus describes the factorization of the normal distribution into conditionally dependent components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref035">35</xref>]. Conversely, if and only if an entry in Θ: Θ<sub><italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic></sub> = 0, then the two variables are conditionally independent, and there is no edge between <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> in 𝓖. We seek to estimate the inverse covariance matrix from the data, thereby inferring associations based on conditional independence. This is fundamentally distinct from SparCC and CCREPE (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s002">S1 Table</xref>), which essentially estimate pairwise correlations (though other pairwise metrics could be considered for CCREPE). We highlight this key difference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g001">Fig 1</xref>. For an intuitive introduction to graphical models in the context of biological networks see Bühlmann <italic>et. al</italic>, 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Inferring the exact underlying graph structure in the presence of a finite amount of samples is, in general, intractable. However, two types of statistical inference procedures have been useful in high-dimensional statistics due to their provable performance guarantees under assumptions about the sample size <italic>n</italic>, dimensionality <italic>p</italic>, underlying graph properties, and the generating distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref039">39</xref>]. The first approach, neighborhood selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref039">39</xref>], aims at reconstructing the graph on a node-by-node basis where, for each node, a penalized regression problem is solved. The second approach is the penalized maximum likelihood method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref023">23</xref>], where the entire graph is reconstructed by solving a global optimization problem, the so-called covariance selection problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref040">40</xref>]. The key advantages of these approaches are that (i) their underlying inference procedures can be formulated as convex (and hence tractable) optimization problems, and (ii) they are applicable even in the underdetermined regime (<italic>p</italic> &gt; <italic>n</italic>), provided that certain structural assumptions about the underlying graph hold. One assumption is that the true underlying graph is reasonably sparse, e.g., that the number of taxon-taxon associations scales linearly with the number of measured taxa.</p>
<p><bold>Graphical model inference</bold>. The SPIEC-EASI pipeline comprises two types of inference schemes, neighborhood and covariance selection. The neighborhood selection framework, introduced by <bold>M</bold>einshausen and <bold>B</bold>ühlmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref020">20</xref>] and thus often referred as the MB method, tackles graph inference by solving <italic>p</italic> regularized linear regression problems, leading to local conditional independence structure predictions for each node.

For non-zero <italic>λ</italic>, the objective function (also referred as the graphical Lasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref022">22</xref>]) encourages sparsity of the underlying precision matrix Θ.

Originally, this estimator was shown to have theoretical guarantees on consistency and recovery only under normality assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref043">43</xref>].

In addition, nonparametric approaches, such as sparse additive models, can be used to “gaussianize” the data prior to network inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref045">45</xref>].

<p>The covariance selection approach has two advantages over the neighborhood selection framework. First, we obtain unique weights associated with each edge in the network. No averaging or subsequent edge selection is necessary. Second, the covariance selection framework provides invertible precision and covariance matrix estimates that can be used in further downstream microbiome analysis tasks, such as regression and discriminant analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p><bold>Model selection</bold>. For both neighborhood and covariance selection, the tuning parameter <italic>λ</italic> ∈ [0, <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub>] controls the sparsity of the final model. Rather than inferring a single graphical model, both methods produce a <italic>λ</italic>-dependent solution path with the complete and the empty graph as extreme networks. A number of model selection criteria, such as Bayesian Information Criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref046">46</xref>] and resampling schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref047">47</xref>], have been used. Here we use a popular model selection scheme known as the <bold>St</bold>ability <bold>A</bold>pproach to <bold>R</bold>egularization <bold>S</bold>election (StARS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref048">48</xref>]. This method repeatedly takes random subsamples (80% in the standard setting) of the data and estimates the entire graph solution path based on this subsample. For each subsample, the <italic>λ</italic>-dependent incidence frequencies of individual edges are retained, and a measure of overall edge stability is calculated. StARS selects the <italic>λ</italic> value at which subsampled non-empty graphs are the least variable (most stable) in terms of edge incidences. For the selected graph, the observed edge frequencies indicate the reproducibility, and likely the predictive power, and are used to rank edges according to confidence.</p>
<p><bold>Theoretical and computational aspects</bold>. Learning microbial graphical models with neighborhood or inverse covariance selection schemes has important theoretical and practical advantages over current methods. A wealth of theoretical results are available that characterize conditions for asymptotic and finite sample guarantees for the estimated networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref046">46</xref>]. Under certain model assumptions, the number of samples <italic>n</italic> necessary to infer the true topology of the graph in the neighborhood selection framework is known to scale as <italic>n</italic> = <italic>O</italic>(<italic>d</italic><sup>3</sup> log(<italic>p</italic>)), where <italic>d</italic> is the maximum vertex (or node) degree of the underlying graph (i.e. the maximum size of any local neighborhood). Additional assumptions on the sample covariance matrices reduce the scaling to <italic>n</italic> = <italic>O</italic>(<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup> log(<italic>p</italic>)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref039">39</xref>]. This implies that graph recovery and precision matrix estimation is indeed possible even in the <italic>p</italic> &gt; &gt; <italic>n</italic> regime, and that the underlying graph topology strongly impacts edge recovery. The latter observation means that, even if the number of interactions <italic>e</italic> is constant, graphs with large hub nodes, perhaps representing keystone species in microbial networks, or, more generally, scale-free graphs with, a few highly connected nodes, will be more difficult to recover than networks with evenly distributed neighborhoods. In addition to these theoretical results, a second advantage is that well-established, efficient, and scalable implementations are available to infer microbial ecological networks from OTU data in practice. Thus, SPIEC-EASI methods will efficiently scale as microbiome dataset dimensions grow (e.g., due to technological advances that increase the number of OTUs detected per sample). The SPIEC-EASI inference engine relies on the R package <italic>huge</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref049">49</xref>], which includes algorithms to solve neighborhood and covariance selection problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref022">22</xref>], as well as the StARS model selection.</p>

<title>Generation of synthetic microbial abundance datasets</title>
<p>Estimating the absolute and comparative performance of network inference schemes from biological data remains a fundamental challenge in biology. In the context of gene regulatory network inference, recent community-wide efforts, such as the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) Challenges (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.the-dream-project.org/">http://www.the-dream-project.org/</ext-link>), have considerably advanced our understanding about feasibility, accuracy, and applicability of a large number of developed methods. In the DREAM challenges, both real data from “gold standard” regulatory networks (e.g., networks where the true topology is known from independent experimental evidence) and realistic in-silico data (using, e.g., the GeneNetWeaver pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref050">50</xref>]) are included. In the context of microbiome data and microbial ecological networks, neither a gold standard nor a realistic synthetic data generator exist. SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools that allow the generation of realistic synthetic OTU data. As outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g002">Fig 2</xref>, real taxa count data serve as input to SPIEC-EASI’s synthetic data generation pipeline. The pipeline enables one to: (i) fit the marginal distributions of the count data to a parametric statistical model and (ii) specify the underlying graphical model architecture (e.g., scale-free).</p>
<p><bold>The NorTA approach</bold>. The parametric statistical model and network topology are then combined in the ‘Normal To Anything’ (NorTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref051">51</xref>] approach to generate synthetic OTU data that resemble real measurements from microbial communities but with user-specified network topologies. NorTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref051">51</xref>] is an approximate technique to generate arbitrary continuous and discrete multivariate distributions, given (1) a target correlation structure <italic>R</italic> with entries <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic></sub> and (2) a target univariate marginal distribution <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. To achieve this task, NorTA relies on normal-copula functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref053">53</xref>]. A <italic>n</italic> × <italic>p</italic> matrix of data U is sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean and a <italic>p</italic> × <italic>p</italic> correlation matrix R<sub>N</sub>. For each marginal <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the Normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) is transformed to the target distribution via its inverse CDF.

<p>In the original NorTA approach, an element-wise monotone transformation <italic>c</italic><sub>U</sub>(⋅) with <italic>R</italic><sub>N</sub> = <italic>c</italic><sub>U</sub>(<italic>R</italic>) is applied to account for slight differences in correlation structure between normal and target distribution samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref051">51</xref>]. Here we neglect this transformation step because we observe that the log-transformed data from exponential count distributions, such as the Poisson and Negative binomial, are already close to R, provided that the mean is greater than one, particularly when the counts data are log-transformed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). In practice, SPIEC-EASI relies on routines from base R and VGAM packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref055">55</xref>] to estimate the uniform quantiles of the normal data and to fit the desired CDF with estimated parameters.</p>
<p><bold>Fitting marginal distribution to real OTU data</bold>. Prior to fitting marginal distributions to real data, several commonly used pre-proccesing steps are applied. For any given OTU abundance table of size <italic>n</italic> × <italic>K</italic>, we first select <italic>p</italic> non-zero columns. To account for experimental differences in sample sequencing, we then normalize samples to a median sequencing depth by multiplying all counts by the ratio of minimum desirable sampling depth to the total sum of counts in that sample and rounding to the nearest whole number, which is preferable to rarefaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref056">56</xref>]. These filtered and sequencing-depth-normalized data serve as the marginal counts, which are fit to a parametric distribution <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and used as input to the NorTA approach. The concrete target marginal distribution depends on the actual microbiome dataset. For gut microbiome data (e.g. from HMP or APG), the zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ziNB) distribution is a good choice, as it accounts for both overdispersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref057">57</xref>] and the preponderance of zero-count data points in microbial count datasets. The fitting procedure is done within a maximum likelihood framework. The corresponding optimization problem is solved with the Quasi-Newton methods with box-constraints, as implemented in the optim function in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref054">54</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s001">S1 Text</xref>, we use quantile-quantile plots to compare ziNB to several other candidate distributions (e.g., lognormal, Poisson, NB) and show that ziNB has superior fit.</p>
<p><bold>Generation of network topologies and correlation matrices</bold>. Under normality assumption, the non-zero pattern of the precision matrix corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph. We use this property to generate target covariance (correlation) matrices originating from different graph topologies. The pipeline to generate a network structure for simulated data proceeds in three steps: (i) Generate an undirected graph, in the form of an adjacency matrix, with a desired topology and sparsity, (ii) convert the adjacency matrix to a positive-definite precision matrix by assigning positive and negative edge weights and appropriate diagonal entries, and (iii) invert Θ and convert the resulting covariance matrix Σ to a correlation matrix (<italic>R</italic> = <italic>D</italic>Σ<italic>D</italic>, where, <italic>D</italic> is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004226.e030"><mml:math id="M30" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>Among many potential graph structures, we focus on three representative network structures: band-like, cluster, and scale-free graphs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g003">Fig 3b</xref> for graphical examples). Maximum network degree strongly impacts network recovery, and thus our choice of network topologies spans a range of maximum degrees (band &lt; cluster &lt; scale-free). In addition, cluster and scale-free lend themselves to hypothetical ecological scenarios. Cluster graphs may be seen as archetypal models for microbial communities that populate different disjoint niches (clusters) and have only few associations across niches. Scale-free graphs, ubiquitous in many other facets of network biology (such as gene regulatory, protein-protein and social networks), serve as a baseline model for a microbial community that comprises (1) a few “keystone” species (hub nodes with many partners) that are essential for coordinating/stabilizing the community and (2) many dependent species that are sparsely connected to each other. The sparsity of the networks is controlled by the number of edges, <italic>e</italic> &lt; <italic>p</italic>(<italic>p</italic> − 1)/2, in the graph. The topologies are generated according to the following algorithms, starting with an empty <italic>p</italic> × <italic>p</italic> adjacency matrix:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><bold>Band:</bold> A band-type network consists of a chain of nodes that connect only their nearest neighbors. Let <italic>e</italic> = <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>used</italic></sub> + <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>available</italic></sub>, the number of edges already used and available, respectively. Fill the next available off-diagonal vector with edges if and only if <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>available</italic></sub> ≥ number of elements in the off-diagonal.</p>

For each component, we generate a random (Erdös-Renyi) graph for which we randomly assign an edge between two nodes in the cluster with probability <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004226.e031"><mml:math id="M31" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">comp</mml:mtext></mml:msub> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo> <mml:mi>h</mml:mi> <mml:mo>−</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac> <mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>Scale-free:</bold> The distribution of degrees, the number of edges per node, in a scale-free network is described by a power law, implying that the central node or nodes (potentially keystone species in an ecological network) have proportionally more connections. We use the standard preferential attachment scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref058">58</xref>] until <italic>p</italic> − 1 edges are exhausted.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
After generation of these standard adjacency matrices, we randomly remove or add edges until the adjacency matrix has exactly <italic>e</italic> edges. All schemes generate symmetric adjacency matrices that describes a graph, with entries of 1 if an edge exists and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>From the adjacency matrices, we generate precision matrices by uniformly sampling non-zero entries Θ<sub><italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic></sub> ∈ [−Θ<sub>max</sub>, −Θ<sub>min</sub>]∪[Θ<sub>min</sub>, Θ<sub>max</sub>], where Θ<sub>min</sub>, Θ<sub>max</sub> &gt; 0 are model parameters and describe the strength of the conditional dependence among the nodes. To ensure that the precision matrix is positive definite with tunable condition number <italic>κ</italic> = cond(Θ), we scale the diagonal entries Θ<sub><italic>i</italic>, <italic>i</italic></sub> by a constant <italic>c</italic> using binary search. The precision matrix Θ is then converted to a correlation matrix <italic>R</italic> to be used as input to the NorTA approach.</p>

<title>Network inference on synthetic microbiome data</title>
<p>Given that no large-scale experimentally validated microbial ecological network exists, we use SPIEC-EASI’s data generator capabilities to synthesize data whose OTU count distributions faithfully resemble microbiome count data. By varying parameters known to influence network recovery (network topology, association strength, sample number) and quantifying performance on resulting networks, we rigorously assess SPIEC-EASI inference relative to state-of-the-art inference methods, SparCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>] and CCREPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>], as well as standard Pearson correlation.</p>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Benchmark setup</title>
<p>We modeled the synthetic datasets on American Gut Project data using SPIEC-EASI’s data generation module. The count data, accessed February, 2014 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.microbio.me/qiime">www.microbio.me/qiime</ext-link> and available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi/tree/master/inst/extdata">https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi/tree/master/inst/extdata</ext-link>, come from two sampling rounds and comprise several thousand OTUs. Round 1 data contains <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> = 304, and Round 2 data contains <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub> = 254 samples. As filtering steps, OTUs were removed from the input data if present in fewer than 37% of the samples, while samples were removed if total sequencing depth fell below the 1st quartile (10,800 sequence reads). Thus, we arrived at a total of <italic>p</italic> = 205 distinct OTUs. We also generated smaller-dimensional datasets (<italic>p</italic> = 68) with fewer zero counts by requiring that OTUs be present in &gt; 60% of the samples. We used Round 1 data and fit the <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> count histograms to a ziNB distribution (for justification of this, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The empirical effective number <italic>n</italic><sub>eff</sub> is 13.5 for <italic>p</italic> = 205 and 7.5 for <italic>p</italic> = 68 data. The resulting parametrized marginal distributions served as input to NorTA.</p>
<p>As described above, network topology is expected to influence network recovery; thus, we consider the three previously described topologies (band-like, cluster, and scale-free) as representative microbial networks. We hypothesize that any method that successfully infers the sets of associations underlying these archetypal networks from synthetic datasets is likely to also perform well in the context of true microbiomes, whose underlying network architecture is unknown but expected to be a mixture of these network types. For all networks, we fix the total number of edges <italic>e</italic> to the respective number of OTUs <italic>p</italic>, and we analyze a medium (<italic>p</italic> = 68) and a high-dimensional scenario (<italic>p</italic> = 205). Microbial association strength is controlled by the range of values in off-diagonal entries in the precision matrices Θ and the condition number <italic>κ</italic> = cond(Θ). We use Θ<sub>min</sub> = 2 and Θ<sub>max</sub> = 3 with either condition number <italic>κ</italic> = 10 or 100. In this setting, <italic>κ</italic> controls the spread of the absolute correlation values (and thus the strength of indirect associations) present in the synthetic data. The relationship between condition number and distribution of correlation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s005">S3 Fig</xref>. For each network type and size, we generate 20 distinct instances. For each instance, we then use the NorTA approach to generate a maximum of <italic>n</italic> = 1360 synthetic microbial count data samples. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s004">S2 Fig</xref>, we highlight the fidelity between the target microbiome dataset and the synthetic datasets, especially in terms of dataset dimensions and OTU count distributions. To assess the effect of sample size on network recovery, we test methods on a range of sample sizes: <italic>n</italic> = 34, 68, 102, 1360.</p>
<p>We compare SPIEC-EASI’s covariance selection method (referred to as S-E(glasso)) and neighborhood selection method (referred to as S-E(MB)) to SparCC and CCREPE, methods which were also designed to be robust to compositional artifacts. As a baseline reference, we also compared all methods to Pearson correlation, which is neither compositionally robust nor appropriate for estimating correlation in the under-determined regime. Both of these methods, however, infer interactions from correlations and do not consider the concept of conditional independence. We improved the runtime of the original SparCC implementation (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc">https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc</ext-link>) and include the updated code in our SPIEC-EASI package.

<title>Recovery of microbial networks</title>
<p>To quantify each method’s ability to recover the true underlying association network, we evaluated performance in terms of precision-recall (P-R) curves and area under P-R curves (AUPR). For each method, we ranked edge predictions according to confidence. For SparCC, CCREPE and Pearson correlation, edge predictions were ranked according to p-value. SPIEC-EASI edge predictions were ranked according to edge stability, inferred by StARS model selection step at the most stable tuning parameter <italic>λ</italic><sub>StARS</sub>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g004">Fig 4</xref> summarizes methods’ performance on 960 independent synthetic datasets for a total of 48 conditions (4 samples sizes × 2 conditions numbers × 3 network topologies × 2 dimensions).</p>

<p>We observe the following key trends. First, the performance of all methods improves with increasing sample size. Under certain scenarios, even near-perfect recovery (AUPR ≈ 1) is possible in the large sample limit (<italic>n</italic> = 1360). Second, all methods show a clear dependence on the network topology. Best performance is achieved for band graphs, followed by cluster and scale-free graphs. These results are consistent with theoretical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref029">29</xref>], which show that the maximum node degree <italic>d</italic> reduces the probability of correctly inferring network edges for fixed sample size (scale-free networks have highest maximum degree, followed by cluster and then band.) Third, for most scenarios, the SPIEC-EASI methods, particularly S-E(MB), perform as well or significantly better than all control methods. Standard Pearson correlation is outperformed by all methods that take the compositional nature of the data into account. Forth, in the large sample limit (<italic>n</italic> = 1360), S-E(MB) is the only method that recovers a significant portion of edges under all tested scenarios (particularly scale-free networks). Additionally, we observe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s012">S10 Fig</xref>) that SPIEC-EASI performs well on synthetic data generated by the SparCC benchmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>The present results suggest that complete network recovery is likely an unrealistic goal for microbiome studies, given that most studies have at most hundreds of samples. In addition, the P-R curves are based on ranking predicted edges. To generate a final network, confidence-based criteria must be applied to select a final set of edges for network inclusion, and, to date, no optimal selection process exists. Nonetheless, if we focus on the set of high-confidence interactions (i.e. the top-ranked entries in the edge list), we see that S-E methods, particularly S-E(MB), can achieve very high precision for all network types (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g004">Fig 4</xref> for a representative P-R curve).</p>
<p>Overall, these results suggest that S-E methods outperform current state-of-the-art methods in terms of network recovery under most tested scenarios, with S-E(MB) showing superior performance over S-E(glasso).</p>

<title>Recovery of global network properties</title>
<p>Accurate recovery of global network properties (e.g., degree distribution, number of connected components, shortest path lengths) from taxa abundance data would help define the underlying topology of the ecological network (e.g., cluster versus scale-free) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref058">58</xref>]. At this point, little is known about the underlying topology of microbial ecological networks, but, as elaborated in the Discussion, such information could be incorporated as a constraint into SPIEC-EASI’s inference methods, thereby further improving prediction. Thus, we tested how well SPIEC-EASI and other methods recover global network properties from the synthetic datasets and evaluate whether these methods might be able to provide insight into global network architecture, perhaps even in the underdetermined regime, where the prediction of individual edges is less accurate. To control for the disparate means by which individual methods ranked edge confidences (e.g., stability for the SPIEC-EASI methods, estimation of p-values for SparCC, Pearson and CCREPE), for each synthetic dataset and method, final networks were generated by selecting the top 205 predicted edges and comparing to the true synthetic network topologies for <italic>p</italic> = 205 OTUs.</p>
<p>We first consider (node) degree distributions, where node degree is defined as the number of edges each node has. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g005">Fig 5</xref>, we show the empirical degree distribution and the underlying ground truth for all methods and networks types, <italic>n</italic> = 1360 and <italic>κ</italic> = 100. Scale-free networks are characterized by exponential degree distributions, in which few nodes (e.g., hubs and, in our context, potential keystone taxa) have very high degree (e.g., interact with other taxa), while most nodes/taxa have few interactions. In contrast, nodes in cluster networks have relatively even degree, which depends on cluster size. In the ecological context, cluster networks would be consistent with niche communities that share few interactions with microbiota outside of one’s niche community; this structure is also reflected in degree distributions. Using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to measure the dissimilarity between methods’ predicted degree distributions and the true degree distribution we see that S-E(MB) outperforms all other methods in recovering degree distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This performance improvement also holds for smaller samples sizes.</p>

<p>Another common topological feature is betweenness centrality, which, similar to degree, betweenness centrality can be used to gauge the relative importance of a node (e.g., taxon) to the (ecological) network. Betweenness centrality, as the fraction of shortest paths between all other nodes in the network that contain the given node, highlights central nodes. The distribution of nodes’ betweenness centrality provides information about the network architecture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s006">S4 Fig</xref>). Specifically, scale-free networks are expected to have a few nodes with very high betweenness centrality that connect most other nodes to each other; in scale-free networks, betweenness centrality can approach unity. For cluster networks, the maximum betweenness centrality is limited by the total number of independent clusters. In band networks, similar to scale-free, all nodes are connected; however, the degree is fixed and so the betweenness centrality distribution is roughly uniform from zero to one. For smaller sample sizes <italic>n</italic> &lt; 1360, no method dominates. However, for the largest sample size, <italic>n</italic> = 1360, S-E(MB) is again significantly better than all other methods for five out of six conditions with the exception of scale-free networks <italic>κ</italic> = 10, where SparCC recovery is best (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s007">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next consider distributions over graph geodesic distances. The geodesic distance is the length of the shortest path between two nodes. Given the existence of highly connected hubs in scale-free networks, geodesic distances for scale-free networks tend to be short, a feature that is described as the “small-world” property. Thus, the geodesic distributions in the scale-free network are a lot smaller than for the band and cluster networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). In recovery of geodesic distance distributions, S-E(MB) performs equivalently or significantly better than all other methods for scale-free networks as well as band graphs across all conditions. For cluster networks, the other methods generally outperform SPIEC-EASI methods for smaller sample sizes (<italic>n</italic> &lt; 1360). In the large sample limit <italic>n</italic> = 1360, S-E(MB) has significantly better recovery of geodesic distance distributions relative to all control methods, even for cluster graphs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s009">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed the number and size of connected components in the inferred graphs. While all synthetic band and scale-free synthetic networks form a single connected component containing all nodes, cluster networks have a variable number of connected components. In terms of cluster number recovery, all methods predicted too many connected components. Overall, S-E methods had lower error rates for band and scale-free networks over all sample sizes. For high sample number (<italic>n</italic> = 1360), S-E(MB) had significantly better recover of cluster size across all network types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s010">S8 Fig</xref>), with nearly perfect recovery for cluster graphs (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>KL</italic></sub> = 0, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s011">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Inference of the American Gut network</title>
<p>Thus far we have used the <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> = 304 first-round AGP samples as a means to construct realistic synthetic microbiome data sets with SPIEC-EASI’s data generation module. In this section, we apply SPIEC-EASI inference methods to construct ecological association networks from the AGP data directly. To do this, we first filter out rare OTUs by selecting only the top 205 OTUs (to match the dimensionality of the synthetic data) in the combined AGP dataset (by frequency of presence) before adding a pseudo-count and total-sum normalization. Although there is no independent means to assess the accuracy of these hypothetical networks, we can assess their reproducibility and consistency. For each method, we first infer a single representative network of taxon-taxon interactions from Round 1 AGP abundance data. For SPIEC-EASI, the StARS model selection approach is used to select the final model network. For SparCC, we use a threshold <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = 0.35 to construct a relevance network from the SparCC-inferred correlation matrix; i.e. an edge between nodes <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> is present in the SparCC network if ∣<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic></sub>∣ &gt; <italic>ρ</italic><sub>t</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>]. Similarly, we use a q-value cut-off of 10<sup>−24</sup> to create an interaction network from CCREPE-corrected significance scores of Pearson’s correlation coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>]. For each method, we thus arrive at a reference network that can be considered the hypothetical gold standard. We then use the <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub> = 254 Round 2 AGP samples as an independent test set and learn a new model network from these data alone. We measure consistency between the two network models by computing the Hamming distance between the reference and new network models, i.e., the difference between the upper triangular part of the two adjacency matrices. For the present data, the Hamming distance can vary between <italic>p</italic>(<italic>p</italic> − 1)/2 = 20910 (no edges in common) and a minimum of 0 for identical networks. Confidence intervals for Hamming distances can be obtained by combining Round 1 and 2 samples into a unified dataset, repeatedly subsampling these data into two disjoint groups of size <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub>, and repeating the entire inference procedure.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g006">Fig 6a</xref> shows network reproducibility for SPIEC-EASI methods, SparCC, and CCREPE. The S-E(MB) has smallest the Hamming distance, followed by S-E(glasso), SparCC, and CCREPE. In S-E(MB), the edge disagreement is roughly 50 with very small error bars. At the other extreme, CCREPE edge disagreement is 250 edges and highly variable.</p>

All four methods agree on a core network that consists of 127 edges. These edges are mostly found within OTUs of the same taxonomic group.

Assortativity is one of the most salient features of the AGP-derived networks, and, for all networks, the assortativity coefficients for each network are close to unity (e.g., maximum assortativity, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s013">S11 Fig</xref>). The SparCC network comprises about twice as many edges as the SPIEC-EASI networks. SparCC infers 147 distinct edges; these additional edges correspond to negative associations between OTUs of Ruminococcaceae (genus <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>) and Enterobacteriacae families (various genera) and a dense web of correlations within Enterobacteriacae OTUs. Similarly, CCREPE identified 152 edges uniquely, with many negative edges between Enterobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae (genera: <italic>Blautia</italic>, <italic>Roseburia</italic> and unknown); additionally, CCREPE uniquely predicted positive edges between the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (genus: <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>). Both SPIEC-EASI methods produce relatively sparse networks by comparison. S-E(glasso) infers a total of 271 total edges (with one unique edge), and S-E(MB) infers 206 edges with 25 unique edges. In scale with edge predictions, both CCREPE and SparCC infer networks with large maximum degree (33 and 30, respectively), while the S-E(MB) and S-E(glasso) networks have a maximum degree of sixteen and eight, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s013">S11 Fig</xref>). However, even though CCREPE and SparCC predict a similar number of total edges, the global network properties are distinct. CCREPE predicts a higher maximum betweenness centrality and a larger number of nodes in the largest connected component (100).</p>
<p>In summary, analysis of the AGP networks suggests that the SPIEC-EASI inference schemes construct more reproducible taxon-taxon interactions than SparCC and CCREPE and infer considerably sparser model networks than the other two methods. These observations may be explained as follows: SparCC and CCREPE aim to recover correlation networks, which contain both direct edges as well as indirect (e.g., spurious) edges (due to correlation alone). SparCC and CCREPE may recover indirect edges less robustly than direct edges, an explanation that would be consistent with the Hamming distance reproducibility analysis. In addition, all methods’ resulting networks suggest that the topology of the American Gut association network cannot be attributed to a specific network class. Instead, these networks are a mixture of band, scale-free, and cluster network type, and they exhibit high phylogenetic assortativity within highly connected components.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inferring interactions among different microbial species within a community and understanding their influence on the environment is of central importance in ecology and medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref060">60</xref>]. An ever increasing number of recent amplicon-based sequencing studies have uncovered strong correlations between microbial community composition and environment in diverse and highly relevant domains of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref063">63</xref>]. These studies alone underscore the need to understand how the microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact with the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref005">5</xref>]. Elucidation of species interactions in microbial communities across different environments remains, however, a formidable challenge. Foremost, available high-throughput experimental data are compositional in nature, overdispersed, and usually underdetermined with respect to statistical inference. In addition, for most microbes few to no ecological interactions are known, thus the ecological interaction network must be constructed <italic>de novo</italic>, in the absence of guiding assumptions and a set of “gold standard” interactions for validation.</p>
<p>To overcome both challenges, we present SPIEC-EASI (<bold>S</bold>parse <bold>I</bold>nvers<bold>E</bold> <bold>C</bold>ovariance Estimation for <bold>E</bold>cological <bold>A</bold>ssociation <bold>I</bold>nference), a computational framework that includes statistical methods for the inference of microbial ecological interactions from 16S rRNA gene sequencing datasets and a sophisticated synthetic microbiome data generator with controllable underlying species interaction topology. SPIEC-EASI’s inference engine includes two well-known graphical model estimators, neighborhood selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref020">20</xref>] and sparse inverse covariance selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref046">46</xref>] that are extended by compositionally robust data transformations for application to the specific context of microbial abundance data.</p>
<p>The synthetic data pipeline was used to generate realistic-looking gut microbiome datasets for a controlled benchmark of SPIEC-EASI’s inference performance relative to two state-of-the-art methods, SparCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref017">17</xref>] and CCREPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref009">9</xref>]. We showed that neighborhood selection (S-E(MB)) outperforms SparCC and CCREPE in terms of recovery of taxon-taxon interactions and global network topology features under almost all tested benchmark scenarios, while covariance selection (S-E(glasso)) performs competitively with and sometimes better than SparCC and CCREPE.</p>
<p>Through our simulation study, we demonstrate that several other factors, in addition to total number of samples, affect network recovery. Foremost and in agreement with theoretical results from high-dimensional statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref039">39</xref>], network topology has a significant impact, as network recovery performance is nearly doubled from scale-free to cluster to band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g004">Fig 4</xref>) for fixed sample size, number of taxa, and condition number. We also demonstrated dependence to strength of direct interactions (and thus strength of correlations) within a given network. Our simulation study provides the community with rough guidelines for requisite sample sizes, given state-of-the-art network inference and basic assumptions about the underlying network. This is of obvious importance to experimental design and the estimation of statistical power. Here, we used the synthetic data pipeline to generate datasets characteristic of the gut microbiome. However, the SPIEC-EASI data generator is generic and therefore enables researchers to generate synthetic datasets that resemble microbiome samples in terms of taxa dispersion and marginal distributions from their field of research, such as soil or sea water ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Our application study on real American Gut Project (AGP) data revealed that inference with SPIEC-EASI produced more consistent and sparser interaction networks than SparCC and CCREPE. In addition, our AGP network analysis revealed several biologically relevant observations. Specifically, we observed that OTUs were more likely to interact with phylogenetically related OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004226.g006">Fig 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004226.s013">S11 Fig</xref>). In addition, our gut microbial interaction networks appear to be a composite of network types, as we find evidence for scale-free, band-like, and cluster subnetworks.</p>
<p>An important advantage of neighborhood and covariance selection as underlying inference frameworks is their ability to include prior knowledge about the underlying data or network structure from independent scientific studies in a principled manner. For example, in the neighborhood selection scheme, the standard LASSO approach can be augmented by a group penalty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref064">64</xref>] that takes into account <italic>a priori</italic> known group structure. The assortativity observed in our gut microbial interaction networks suggests that such a grouping of OTUs based on phylogenetic relationship might improve inference. Moreover, if verified species interactions are available for a certain microbial contexts, this knowledge can be included in covariance and neighborhood selection by relaxing the penalty term on these interactions. This strategy has already been fruitfully applied to inference of similarly high-dimensional transcriptional regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref065">65</xref>]. Finally, in agreement with theoretical and empirical work in high-dimensional statistics, our synthetic benchmark results confirmed that networks with scale-free structures elude accurate inference even if the underlying network is globally sparse. Recent modified neighborhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref030">30</xref>] and covariance selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref031">31</xref>] schemes improve recovery of scale-free networks and can be conveniently included into SPIEC-EASI.</p>
<p>Finally, although the main focus of this work is inference of microbial interaction networks, estimation of the regularized inverse covariance matrix with S-E(glasso) will be key to addressing several other important questions arising from microbiome studies. For example, statistical methods to infer which taxa are responsive to design factors in 16S gene amplicon studies is an active area of research. Most methods test each taxon independently one-at-a-time (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref056">56</xref>] and references therein) even though taxa are actually highly correlated and thought to ecologically interact. Inference of taxa responses from 16S rRNA gene sequencing datasets could be improved by modeling this correlation structure through incorporation of the inverse covariance matrix into the statistical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref066">66</xref>].</p>
<p>Other, more complex questions are motivated by a desire to understand why and how ecosystems evolve with time. In the dynamic modeling setting, association networks have already been successfully used as an underlying structure to fit a differential-equation-based model of gut microbiome development in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref014">14</xref>]. Thus, association networks provide the underlying topology for dynamic models, which can be used to develop hypotheses about how the ecosystems might respond to specific perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004226.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, SPIEC-EASI is an improvement over state-of-the-art methods for inference of microbial ecological networks from microbiome composition datasets. We demonstrate this through rigorous benchmarking with synthetic networks and also through application to a true biological dataset. In addition, the LASSO underpinnings of the SPIEC-EASI inference methods provide a flexible and principled mathematical framework to incorporate additional information about microbial ecological association networks as it becomes available, thereby improving prediction. We anticipate that SPIEC-EASI network inference will serve as a backbone for more sophisticated modeling endeavors, engendering new hypotheses and predictions of relevance to environmental ecology and medicine.</p>
