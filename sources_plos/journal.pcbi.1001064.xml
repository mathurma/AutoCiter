         <p>Following recent advances in high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)–based proteomics, the numbers of identified phosphoproteins and their phosphosites have greatly increased in a wide variety of organisms. Although a critical role of phosphorylation is control of protein signaling, our understanding of the phosphoproteome remains limited. Here, we report unexpected, large-scale connections revealed between the phosphoproteome and protein interactome by integrative data-mining of yeast multi-omics data. First, new phosphoproteome data on yeast cells were obtained by MS-based proteomics and unified with publicly available yeast phosphoproteome data. This revealed that nearly 60% of ∼6,000 yeast genes encode phosphoproteins. We mapped these unified phosphoproteome data on a yeast protein–protein interaction (PPI) network with other yeast multi-omics datasets containing information about proteome abundance, proteome disorders, literature-derived signaling reactomes, and <italic>in vitro</italic> substratomes of kinases. In the phospho-PPI, phosphoproteins had more interacting partners than nonphosphoproteins, implying that a large fraction of intracellular protein interaction patterns (including those of protein complex formation) is affected by reversible and alternative phosphorylation reactions. Although highly abundant or unstructured proteins have a high chance of both interacting with other proteins and being phosphorylated within cells, the difference between the number counts of interacting partners of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins was significant independently of protein abundance and disorder level. Moreover, analysis of the phospho-PPI and yeast signaling reactome data suggested that co-phosphorylation of interacting proteins by single kinases is common within cells. These multi-omics analyses illuminate how wide-ranging intracellular phosphorylation events and the diversity of physical protein interactions are largely affected by each other.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>To date, high-throughput proteome technologies have revealed that hundreds to thousands of proteins in each of many organisms are phosphorylated under the appropriate environmental conditions. A critical role of phosphorylation is control of protein signaling. However, only a fraction of the identified phosphoproteins participate in currently known protein signaling pathways, and the biological relevance of the remainder is unclear. This has raised the question of whether phosphorylation has other major roles. In this study, we identified new phosphoproteins in budding yeast by mass spectrometry and unified these new data with publicly available phosphoprotein data. We then performed an integrative data-mining of large-scale yeast phosphoproteins and protein–protein interactions (complex formation) by an exhaustive analysis that incorporated yeast protein information from several other sources. The phosphoproteome data integration surprisingly showed that nearly 60% of yeast genes encode phosphoproteins, and the subsequent data-mining analysis derived two models interpreting the mutual intracellular effects of large-scale protein phosphorylation and binding interaction. Biological interpretations of both large-scale intracellular phosphorylation and the topology of protein interaction networks are highly relevant to modern biology. This study sheds light on how <italic>in vivo</italic> protein pathways are supported by a combination of protein modification and molecular dynamics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein phosphorylation is a reversible, ubiquitous, and fundamentally post-translational modification (PTM) that regulates a variety of biological processes; one of its critical roles is the control of protein signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Hunter1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Pawson1">[3]</xref>. Recent advances in mass-spectrometry (MS)–based technologies and phosphopeptide enrichment methods have enabled the use of high-throughput <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphosite mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Aebersold1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Witze1">[7]</xref> to identify thousands of phosphoproteins. To date, around 10,000 phosphosites of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues have been identified in each of many organisms, including human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Beausoleil1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Olsen2">[12]</xref>, mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Villen1">[13]</xref> and yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Chi1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Holt1">[16]</xref>. Many public databases, such as PHOSIDA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Gnad1">[17]</xref>, Phospho.ELM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Diella1">[18]</xref>, and UniProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-UniProt1">[19]</xref>, have been developed or expanded to catalog such phosphoproteome data. Accordingly, the numbers of phosphoproteins that have been identified in various organisms now greatly exceed the numbers known to have roles in protein signaling. This has raised the question of whether this intracellular phosphorylation, which occurs on such a large scale, has other major roles.</p>
      <p>In modern biology, the use of high-throughput screening methods has enabled rapid progress in the disclosure of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks in many organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Giot1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Tarassov1">[27]</xref>. Topological features common to PPI networks (e.g., scale-free and small-world properties) are of prime importance in interpreting intracellular protein behavior and the evolutionary aspects of PPIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Barabasi1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Watts1">[31]</xref>. PTM changes the physical characteristics of proteins. It is therefore probable that reversible PTM has large effects on the dynamic states of intracellular protein-binding patterns and complex formation, and that it controls not only signal transduction but also many other cellular pathways. However, the impact of PTM on the whole picture of the PPI network has not yet been described.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe the intracellular global relationships between protein phosphorylation and physical PPI, as derived from the results of integrative and systematic data-mining of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> multi-omics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). New phosphoproteome data on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were initially obtained by MS–based analysis and unified with data on previously identified phosphoproteomes. We superimposed the unified phosphoproteome data onto a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PPI network with other multi-omics data on <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> From the results, we infer that the tremendous numbers of phosphorylations within a cell have a large impact on PPI diversity, and that intracellular phosphorylation patterns are affected partly by simultaneous phosphorylation of physically bound proteins that is triggered by the action of single kinases.</p>

         <p>On the basis of liquid chromatography (LC)-MS analysis, we initially identified 1,993 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> phosphoproteins containing 6,510 phosphosites. Information on the identified phosphopeptides has been stored in PepBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pepbase.iab.keio.ac.jp" xlink:type="simple">http://pepbase.iab.keio.ac.jp</ext-link>). We unified these new phosphoproteome data with the publicly available phosphoproteome datasets of Holt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Holt1">[16]</xref> and UniProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-UniProt1">[19]</xref> and obtained a total of 3,477 phosphoproteins containing 25,997 phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g002">Fig. 2</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s010">Table S1</xref>). The pS/pT/pY ratios of this study, the study of Holt et al., and UniProt were 72%/23%/5%, 72%/23%/5%, and 80%/18%/2%, respectively. Among the unified phosphoproteome data, 343 phosphoproteins and 2,778 phosphosites were not found in the data of Holt et al. or UniProt. Comparison with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genomic information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Hong1">[32]</xref> revealed that 58.5% of the 5,815 known and predicted genes were phosphoprotein-encoding genes (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s011">Table S2</xref>). Although the use of current high-throughput technologies cannot disclose the entire phosphoproteome picture of a cell, these results imply that most intracellular proteins can be phosphorylated under the appropriate environmental conditions.</p>

         <title>Generation of phospho-PPI network</title>
         <p>The unified phosphoproteome data were superimposed onto the PPI network to generate a “phospho-PPI” network. PPI data were obtained via DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Salwinski1">[33]</xref> and grouped into four categories according to the experimental method used for the PPI assay: all kinds of experimental methods (“ALL”), yeast two-hybrid (“Y2H”), co-immunoprecipitation (“IMM”), and tandem affinity purification (“TAP”). Among all the protein nodes involved in every category of the phospho-PPI network, the proportion of phosphoproteins was also nearly 60% (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). For example, the phospho-PPI network of the “ALL” category was composed of 4,945 proteins, including 2,934 phosphoproteins (59.3%) and 17,215 physical interactions.</p>

         <title>Phosphoproteins have more PPI partners than do nonphosphoproteins</title>
         <p>To explore specific characteristics of the phospho-PPI network, the number counts of interacting partners of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins were analyzed (note that throughout this study, the word “nonphosphoprotein” means a protein with no phosphosite identified to date). We found that, in general, phosphoproteins had more interacting partners than nonphosphoproteins. In each phospho-PPI network of the “ALL” and “Y2H” categories with enough protein nodes for the subsequent statistical analysis, the cumulative percentage distributions of node degrees (or the number count of interacting partners) of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins were markedly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g003">Fig. 3A and D</xref>). For example, in the dataset of “ALL”, 47.6% of nonphosphoproteins had three or more interacting partners, but this was true for 67.9% of phosphoproteins. Moreover, in both datasets, about twice as many phosphoproteins as nonphosphoproteins had 10 interacting partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g003">Fig. 3B and E</xref>). To analyze the statistical significance of this difference in the context of phosphorylation, we prepared randomly generated phospho-PPI networks by “node label shuffling” (NLS), in which the node positions of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins were randomly moved within the phospho-PPI networks (for details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). This demonstrated that the node degree of phosphoproteins was significantly higher than expected from a random distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g003">Fig. 3C and F</xref>).</p>

         <p>Node degree in PPI networks has an exponential relationship with protein expression level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Ivanic1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Yu1">[36]</xref>, perhaps because cellular proteins with more copies have a greater possibility of interacting with others by chance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Yu1">[36]</xref>. Therefore, if the phosphoproteome data are biased by protein abundance and highly abundant proteins tend to be identified as phosphoproteins, there is a strong possibility that the relationship between phosphorylation and node degree is spurious, with no direct causal connection. In fact, proteome abundance data obtained through a single-cell proteomic analysis combining high-throughput flow cytometry and a library of GFP-tagged yeast strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Newman1">[37]</xref> showed that the number of phosphoproteins in the “ALL” phospho-PPI was skewed, especially among highly abundant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g004">Fig. 4A and D</xref>). However, we demonstrated that in the “ALL” phospho-PPI network there were still significant differences in the node degree levels of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins of similar abundance, and that the differences could be explained independently of protein copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g004">Fig. 4B, C, E and F</xref>). Similar results were derived from the phospho-PPI network generated only from the “Y2H” category (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). We further compared the abilities to predict phosphoproteins by using node degree and protein abundance levels above given thresholds. The predictive power of node degree was markedly higher than that of protein abundance, except in the case of proteins that were extremely abundant (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). If this higher predictive ability were attributable to a spurious relationship associated with the actual intracellular proteome abundance, then the node degree of a protein given by PPI assays would appear to provide a better approximation of the intracellular protein copy number than would single-cell proteomic analysis, which is unlikely.</p>

         <p>Protein disorder is also a typical feature of “hub” proteins in PPI networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Dosztanyi1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Haynes1">[40]</xref>. Parts of unstructured proteins lack fixed structure, and such disordered regions may have the ability to bind multiple proteins and to diversify PPI networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Dosztanyi1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Haynes1">[40]</xref>. Additionally, at the proteome level, phosphorylation occurs at high rates in the disordered regions of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Holt1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Gnad1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Gsponer1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Taylor1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, it is highly likely that protein disorder affects the node degree difference between phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins. For every <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein registered in UniProt, we calculated the probability of harboring intrinsic disordered regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In the “ALL” phospho-PPI network, the ratio of phosphoproteins to nonphosphoproteins increased smoothly with increasing disorder probability level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>). However, in the same network, the node degree levels of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins of the same disorder probability level were significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g004">Fig. 4H and I</xref>). Even between phosphoproteins that had a low disorder probability of &lt;0.1 and nonphosphoproteins that had an extremely high disorder probability of &gt;0.9, the node degree level of the phosphoproteins was significantly higher than that of the nonphosphoproteins (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0043). Similar results were observed in the “Y2H” dataset (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). These results imply that the higher node degree of phosphoproteins than of nonphosphoproteins is at least partly independent of the PPI network diversity produced by unstructured proteins.</p>
         <p>Other factors that could influence the relationship between protein phosphorylation and interaction are protein size and protein groups with identical cellular function. Larger proteins may have a greater chance of being phosphorylated and may provide more binding domains for interactions with other proteins. However, similar to the results for protein abundance and disorder, statistical significance of the higher node degree of phosphoproteins was observed independently of protein length (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). (Phosphorylation probability was highly correlated with protein length; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s004">Fig. S4</xref>.) In the event that both protein phosphorylation and interaction events occurring in a fraction of proteins confer a particular, identical cellular function, then the global difference in node degree levels of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins would appear to be caused only by differences in function. However, we found that, for most functional annotations of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in GO Slim (a higher level view of Gene Ontology), there was a higher node degree level for phosphoproteins than for nonphosphoproteins (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
         <p>The average node degree of phosphoproteins is higher than that of nonphosphoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Tan2">[45]</xref>, but it was unclear 1) whether this characteristic was observable only in hub proteins or whether it existed broadly at the proteome level; and 2) whether this was a spurious correlation that had emerged because of the presence of some third factor hidden in the complex and intertwining proteomes. Our results show that, in many cases, this characteristic is present not only in hub proteins but also in proteins that have few interacting partners. They also imply that these protein interactions or binding patterns are not the result of influence by a third factor but are caused by phosphorylation-dependent cellular activities.</p>

         <title>Diversification of PPIs by phosphorylation</title>
         <p>The additive effect of kinase–substrate and phosphatase–substrate reactions is one possible model for interpreting this phenomenon in the phospho-PPI network. If PPIs include many transient signaling reactions between kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates (most of which are phosphorylated under certain conditions), then the signaling proteins may have interactions additional to the cohesive protein binding interactions in the PPI data. Indeed, some enzyme–protein substrate interactions are surprisingly stable and can be captured in protein interaction assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Walhout1">[46]</xref>. However, of the 795 yeast phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions for which information has previously been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Fiedler1">[47]</xref>, only 3.9%, 1.6%, 2.4%, and 0.8% overlapped with those in our “ALL,” “Y2H,” “IMM,” and “TAP” PPI datasets, respectively (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). [Note, however, that these values were significantly higher than those expected from negative controls of the corresponding PPI networks generated by “random edge rewiring” (RER), and similar, significant overlaps between physical PPI and signaling network were obtained by another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Linding1">[48]</xref>; for details of RER, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>.] On the other hand, the node degree levels of at least 600 proteins (&gt;20% of phosphoproteomes in the “ALL” phospho-PPI network) might have been related to, and affected by, phosphorylation, as evidenced by the cumulative percentage of phosphoproteins, which was more than 20% higher than that of nonphosphoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition to this, many unidentified phosphoproteins are certain to be present in the nonphosphoprotein dataset. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret such a large difference in the node degree of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins only in terms of the additive effect of signaling reactions, which had such a small overlap with the PPI data. Furthermore, among the GO Slim ontology groups within the “signal transduction” and “cell cycle” categories, which especially include many signaling proteins, there were no great distinctions between the node degree levels of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins (although the node degree levels for “cytokinesis” and “response to stress,” like those for most of the other ontology groups, showed marked differences between phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins) (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
         <p>In the phospho-PPI network, phosphoproteins had a greater tendency than nonphosphoproteins to interact with proteins harboring phosphoprotein binding domains (PPBDs). Out of 10 known PPBDs—14-3-3, BRCT, C2, FHA, MH2, PBD, PTB, SH2, WD-40, and WW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Gong1">[49]</xref>—six (BRCT, C2, FHA, SH2, WD-40, and WW) were present in the member proteins of the “ALL” phospho-PPI network, and the average probabilities that phosphoproteins would interact with proteins that had all PPBDs or each type of PPBD were higher than those for nonphosphoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). (The gap between node degree levels of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins was normalized; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>.) Considering all of these results and perspectives, a reasonable and generalized model that can be used to interpret the higher node degree of phosphoproteins is that reversible and alternative phosphorylation reactions alter the physical characteristics of proteins under various environmental conditions; the interacting or binding partners of phosphoproteins are thereby more diversified than those of nonphosphorylated proteins. Consistent with this interpretation, phosphoproteins harboring at least two phosphosites had more interacting partners than those with a single phosphosite in the phospho-PPI network (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s007">Fig. S7</xref>), even though phosphoproteins follow a power-law distribution with regard to phosphosite number counts and only a small fraction of phosphoproteins have multiple phosphosites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Yachie1">[50]</xref>. Protein phosphorylation reactions therefore seem to make a large contribution to intracellular PPI diversity.</p>

         <title>Co-phosphorylation of interacting proteins by single kinase</title>
         <p>Proteins involved in signal transduction pathways tend to be phosphorylated, and this is reflected in the PPI data, although the overlaps between such signaling reactions and PPIs are limited (see above and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Another possible interpretation for the multitude of physical interactions between phosphoproteins is that physically binding proteins that are members of the same protein complex tend to be phosphorylated simultaneously by a single enzyme. To search for the protein kinases potentially responsible for the co-phosphorylation of proteins forming the same complex, we analyzed a dataset of kinase–substrate relationships with PPI data of the “ALL” category. In the following analysis, we used 85 and 65 kinases, respectively, from the experimental results of an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase–substrate assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Ptacek1">[53]</xref> and a literature-derived collection of yeast signaling reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Fiedler1">[47]</xref>, each having multiple substrates (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s012">Table S3</xref>).

         <p>Accordingly, we suggest that, when a protein complex and kinase are in close proximity within the intracellular environment, there is a high chance of simultaneous phosphorylation of member proteins participating in the complex. This is consistent with the subcellular co-localization of signaling networks recently revealed through the systematic prediction of signaling networks by using phosphoproteome data with an integrated protein network information derived from curated pathway databases, co-occurring terms in abstracts, physical protein interaction assays, mRNA expression profiles, and the genomic context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Linding1">[48]</xref>, and by data analysis of time-course phosphoproteome data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Imamura1">[54]</xref>. IKMs may enhance the subcellular co-localization of signaling reactions, and/or vice versa. The literature-derived signaling collection is presumably more enriched with well-investigated reactions and thus may more accurately reflect <italic>in vivo</italic> signaling. This may explain why the collection harbored more kinases with high IKM formabilities (12 out of 65) than the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase–substrate relationship data (three out of 85).</p>

         <title>Bi-directional impacts of protein phosphorylation and binding</title>
         <p>It is plausible that, in living cells, the diversity of protein interactomes (not only of protein signaling but also of protein complex formation) is essentially influenced by the large number of phosphorylation events; many reversible phosphorylations might control condition-specific protein binding interactions related to different subcellular processes and molecular machines. On the other hand, protein phosphorylation patterns also seem to depend largely on intracellular protein interaction diversity.</p>
         <p>It is possible that many of the proteins defined as nonphosphoproteins in this study can actually be phosphorylated under appropriate cellular conditions. Even where this is true, however, the set we defined here as phosphoproteins should be enriched with proteins that are frequently phosphorylated under normal or many different cellular conditions, because the frequently phosphorylated proteins have a higher chance of being identified as phosphoproteins than do the rarely phosphorylated proteins. Accordingly, the features and models discussed in this study should reflect the overall characteristics of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins among a number of different cellular conditions. This is supported by the finding that proteins that had two or more phosphosites physically interacted with more proteins than did those with only a single phosphosite (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001064.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). Although the quality of current yeast PPI data is also not perfect and the data may include false positives, the observed features with statistical significance should be consequences of the actual behaviors of intracellular proteins, because the effects of such false positives on the statistical tests are supposedly random.</p>

         <p>From SGD (<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yeastgenome.org" xlink:type="simple">http://yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Hong1">[32]</xref>, annotations of 5,815 known and predicted genes were obtained. ORF names of genes were checked by using the unified phosphoproteome data to determine whether the encoded protein was identified as a phosphoprotein.</p>

         <title>PPI network</title>
         <p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PPI network was obtained as XML files (Scere20081014) from DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Salwinski1">[33]</xref>. We eliminated each interaction entry including three or more “interactors” (e.g., in which multiple prey proteins were detected for one bait protein in one experimental assay) and used only those including two “interactors.” Every node in the PPI network was labeled by its corresponding UniProt ID provided in the same XML file. For the PPI assay, PPI data were further grouped into four categories: all kinds of experimental methods (“ALL”), yeast two-hybrid (“Y2H”), co-immunoprecipitation (“IMM”), and tandem affinity purification (“TAP”). A “filtered” PPI network was also prepared for each category by eliminating interactions between two similar proteins by using the BLASTP program and an E-value cut-off of 1e–10.</p>

         <title>Phospho-PPI</title>
         <p>Unified phosphoproteome data were mapped onto every category of PPI data prepared from DIP according to their UniProt accessions, and a phospho-PPI network was generated. Throughout this study, proteins that did not correspond to phosphoproteome data were termed “nonphosphoproteins.”</p>

         <title>Negative control generation</title>
         <p>To prepare negative controls for PPI and phospho-PPI networks, two different processes (as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001064-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) were appropriately adopted on a case-by-case basis. “Node label shuffling” (NLS) swaps the labels of two randomly selected nodes in a given network; it repeats this operation a sufficient number of times until all pair-wise interactions in the queried network have disappeared or until the number of iterations reaches 1,000 times the number of interactions. “Random edge rewiring” (RER) randomly selects two edges in a given network and randomly rewires them. During this process, each rewiring operation is retried if a pair of nodes redundantly wired by two edges occurs in the network; the iteration termination condition is the same as that of NLS.</p>

         <title>Proteome abundance data</title>
         <p>Proteome abundance data for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that were previously acquired through a single-cell proteomics analysis combining high-throughput flow cytometry and a library of GFP-tagged strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Newman1">[37]</xref> were used to analyze the characteristics of protein expression in the phospho-PPI network. These data were composed of proteome abundance data measured for cells grown in rich (YEPD) and synthetic complete (SD) medium. For each cell growth condition, protein names were standardized to UniProt accessions, and protein abundance levels were log-transformed (base 10) and superimposed on each of the phospho-PPI networks of “ALL” and “Y2H.” In this case, protein nodes for which the abundance levels were not provided in the abundance data were deleted from the phospho-PPI network.</p>

         <p>The protein disorder level of every <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein registered in UniProt (release 15.14) was predicted by the POODLE-W program, which uses the support vector machine–based learning of amino acid sequences of structurally confirmed disordered proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001064-Shimizu1">[61]</xref>. For the analysis, we used the “disorder probability” (i.e. the probability that a given protein is unstructured) output by this program.</p>

         <p>To evaluate the tendencies of phosphoproteins and nonphosphoproteins to interact with proteins that had PPBDs, the normalized probabilities of such interactions were defined. For each protein, the number of interacting protein partners that had PPBDs was divided by the number of all interacting partners.</p>

         <p>The statistical significance of differences in a single real value from a group of repeatedly generated random values was estimated by calculating the proportion of random values equal to the real value or more (or less, in certain instances). The Wilcoxon–Mann-Whitney rank sum was used to assess statistical significance between groups.</p>
