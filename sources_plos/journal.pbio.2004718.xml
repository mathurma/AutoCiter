<abstract>
<p>Sarcomeres are stereotyped force-producing mini-machines of striated muscles. Each sarcomere contains a pseudocrystalline order of bipolar actin and myosin filaments, which are linked by titin filaments. During muscle development, these three filament types need to assemble into long periodic chains of sarcomeres called myofibrils. Initially, myofibrils contain immature sarcomeres, which gradually mature into their pseudocrystalline order. Despite the general importance, our understanding of myofibril assembly and sarcomere maturation in vivo is limited, in large part because determining the molecular order of protein components during muscle development remains challenging. Here, we applied polarization-resolved microscopy to determine the molecular order of actin during myofibrillogenesis in vivo. This method revealed that, concomitantly with mechanical tension buildup in the myotube, molecular actin order increases, preceding the formation of immature sarcomeres. Mechanistically, both muscle and nonmuscle myosin contribute to this actin order gain during early stages of myofibril assembly. Actin order continues to increase while myofibrils and sarcomeres mature. Muscle myosin motor activity is required for the regular and coordinated assembly of long myofibrils but not for the high actin order buildup during sarcomere maturation. This suggests that, in muscle, other actin-binding proteins are sufficient to locally bundle or cross-link actin into highly regular arrays.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Muscles produce high mechanical forces to power our daily movements. The mini-machines in our muscles that produce these forces are called sarcomeres. Every sarcomere consists of three protein filaments: thin actin filaments and thick myosin filaments that are linked by titin filaments. These three filaments are present in extremely high order in mature sarcomeres, resembling a liquid crystal. How such a crystalline-like molecular order is generated during sarcomere development is not well understood. Here, we applied a new microscopy technique—polarization-resolved microscopy, which was developed to quantify molecular order of molecules—to the flight muscles of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which is amenable to genetic manipulations. Using this new technique, we demonstrate that actin is indeed assembled into high molecular order during sarcomere development. We tested different mechanisms and found a role for myosin motors during the early assembly steps. However, the high-order organization of actin still happens in the absence of muscle myosin, suggesting that additional proteins other than myosin are involved in ordering actin during sarcomere development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most animals use muscles to produce the forces that power active body movements. Although the various striated muscle types—including vertebrate heart and skeletal muscles, as well as the numerous insect body muscles—differ significantly in their development and physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref002">2</xref>], they all share the same basic organizational principle of their contractile mini-machines called sarcomeres. Each sarcomere is bordered by two Z-discs, anchoring the cross-linked plus (barbed) ends of highly regular actin filaments. The minus (pointed) ends of these actin filaments point towards the center of the sarcomere, where they can interact with motor domains of centrally located bipolar myosin filaments. Actin and myosin filaments are stably connected by a third, connecting filament composed of the gigantic protein titin. Titin’s N-terminus is anchored at the Z-disc, whereas its C-terminus connects to the myosin filaments in insect sarcomeres or extends all the way to the M-line in the middle of the myosin filaments in vertebrate sarcomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref006">6</xref>]. Not only the structural organization of sarcomeres but also their molecular components are highly conserved from worms to humans, suggesting that the sarcomere represents an ancient molecular machine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Sarcomeres are stereotyped units with a defined length, ranging from 3.0 to 3.4 μm in different relaxed human muscle fibers in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref010">10</xref>]. Muscle fibers of large animals need to be several centimeters long to effectively move the relative position of two neighboring bones. Therefore, hundreds of sarcomeric units need to assemble into long periodic chains, called myofibrils, which span the entire muscle fiber and thus mechanically link two skeletal elements. How muscle fibers solve this “dimension problem” during myofibrillogenesis is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> adult indirect flight muscles have a mature muscle fiber length of about 1 mm and a resting sarcomere length of 3.2 μm in vivo. Using this developmental model system, three interesting observations have been made previously. First, laser-induced microlesion experiments revealed a buildup of mechanical tension in the developing myotube. This tension buildup precedes the formation of immature myofibrils and is essential for their regular formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>]. Second, live imaging of endogenous muscle myosin heavy chain showed a simultaneous assembly of immature myofibrils throughout the entire muscle fiber. These myofibrils display an initial periodicity of about 1.8 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>]. Third, during the next 3 days of development, the sarcomere periodicity increases to 3.2 μm present in adult flight muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref013">13</xref>]. Together, these observations suggested that mechanical tension drives the self-organization of actin, myosin, and titin filaments into immature myofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>]. However, how this self-organization is achieved molecularly and how immature myofibrils mature to their final pseudocrystalline order are poorly understood.</p>
<p>One prominent model, the premyofibril model, proposes a stepwise mode of myofibrillogenesis. In a first step, nonmuscle myosin II is proposed to assemble early “premyofibrils.” In a second step, nonmuscle myosin is replaced by muscle myosin to enable myofibril maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref016">16</xref>]. However, whether and how the myosin isoforms actively contribute to the formation of actin order during myofibrillogenesis is not clear. This gap in knowledge is mainly due to two reasons. First, functional in vivo data are sparse because genetic loss-of-function studies of nonmuscle myosin in mice are complicated by redundancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref018">18</xref>]. Second, light or electron microscopic images cannot easily resolve the molecular order of proteins, which is high in mature sarcomeres but much lower in early myotubes. Thus, the molecular order analysis of sarcomeric proteins in genetic mutants in vivo is challenging.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate the mechanism of myofibrillogenesis by combining functional genetics of myosin isoforms with polarization-resolved microscopy, a newly developed microscopy technique that allows us to detect molecular order. Polarization-resolved microscopy was developed to reveal local order of lipids in cell membranes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref019">19</xref>] and proteins such as actin at the cell cortex of early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref020">20</xref>]. We apply it here to investigate actin order generation during muscle development in vivo. We measure molecular actin order during various steps of myofibrillogenesis and test for a genetic requirement of both nonmuscle and muscle myosin during actin ordering. We find a gain in molecular actin order before a reliable periodic actin pattern is detectable by light microscopy. This order gain indeed depends on both nonmuscle and muscle myosin function. We identify a steep increase in molecular actin order during sarcomere maturation, which is largely independent of muscle myosin or its motor activity. These results suggest an important role for actin cross-linkers other than myosin in local actin ordering during sarcomere and myofibril maturation.</p>

<title>Determination of molecular actin order by polarization-resolved microscopy</title>
<p>To get insight into the molecular organization of actin during myofibril and sarcomere formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscles, we applied polarization-resolved microscopy. During polarization-resolved microscopy, a series of confocal images is acquired with variable angles of polarized excitation light. The maximum fluorescence is achieved when the polarization angle of the excitation light matches the dipole angles of the fluorophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref019">19</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and methods</xref> for details). Therefore, if all fluorophores have the same dipole orientation and thus a high molecular order, a large modulation of the fluorescent signal is detected when the polarization axis of the excitation light is rotated. From this modulation, polarization-resolved microscopy quantifies two parameters of molecular order for the measured fluorophores: their mean orientation (ρ) and their angular distribution width (Ψ) around this mean orientation. Thus, Ψ is a proxy for molecular order of the measured fluorophores. Both ρ and Ψ values are determined for each pixel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Entirely disordered fluorophores result in a Ψ of 180°; however, even a crystalline-ordered protein does not result in a Ψ of close to 0° because fluorophores generally exhibit a remanent orientational disorder due to the flexibility of the linker to the protein of interest.</p>

<title>Polarization-resolved microscopy—A method to determine actin order in biological systems.</title>
<p>(A) Polarization-resolved microscopy provides information about F-actin molecular order Ψ and the average actin filament orientation ρ. The left image shows a 32-h APF flight muscle stained with phalloidin–Alexa488 and overlaid with an orange box representing the confocal volume. The middle image displays a hypothetical actin order in the confocal volume, with the different orientations of the phalloidin–Alexa488 dipoles shown by blue arrows. For each confocal volume, one value for the actin molecular order Ψ can be determined. The right diagram shows the average actin filament orientation angle ρ in blue and the actin molecular order angle Ψ in red for the hypothetical confocal volume shown. All order angle values Ψ are shifted by a term Ψ<sub>0</sub>, as first, the Alexa488 dipole forms an undefined angle to the helicoidal actin filament (blue arrows) and second, the Alexa488 label is connected to phalloidin with a linker, allowing some molecular flexibility (represented by the solid light blue cones in the Fig). An order angle Ψ = Ψ<sub>0</sub> is thus a signature of perfect order, whereas a random distribution corresponds to Ψ = 180°. (B–E) Molecular actin order in different biological systems. Samples were fixed and stained with the same phalloidin–Alexa488 probe to reveal a highly disordered actin cytoskeleton in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal eye (41-h APF; several ommatidia are shown) (panels B, B’; Ψ close to 180°), a more regular actin cytoskeleton in the furrow canal of early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (panels C, C’; Ψ = 140°–150°), and in stress fibers of plated mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (panels D, D’; Ψ = 130°–150°), compared with a very-high actin order in mature sarcomeres of 90-h APF flight muscles (panels E, E’; Ψ = 127°). The colors in the overlaid images (panels B–E) relate with the colors in the order tables (B’–E’); the bluer, the higher the molecular actin order. Scale bars represent 10 μm.

<p>In order to apply this method to quantify actin order, we opted for phalloidin coupled with Alexa488, which has been shown to exhibit the least flexibility compared with other labels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref021">21</xref>]. Phalloidin binds selectively to filamentous actin (F-actin), and therefore the order of the different actin filaments in the confocal volume can be compared within one image and between different samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>For proof of principle experiments of our set-up, we aimed to compare the order of F-actin in different biological systems. We find that F-actin in the ommatidia of the pupal <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes is poorly ordered (Ψ = 170° to 180°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1B and 1B’</xref>), whereas the actin cables of the ingressing furrow canal during cellularization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo show significantly higher molecular order (Ψ = 140° to 150°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1C and 1C’</xref>), consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref020">20</xref>]. Actin order within stress fibers of plated adhesive fibroblasts can be even higher (Ψ = 130° to 150°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1D and 1D’</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref020">20</xref>]. We found that actin filaments within the sarcomeres of mature flight muscles of 90-h After Puparium Formation (APF) pupae contain the highest detectable order of all systems tested here, with a very marked and narrow order peak (around Ψ = 127°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004718.s003">S1 Data</xref>). Note that, under the signal-to-noise conditions obtained in the measurements, a precision of about 1° for Ψ is expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref019">19</xref>]. Considering the pseudocrystalline actin arrangement in mature flight muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref023">23</xref>], the measured Ψ value of 127° should correspond to quasi-perfect order—its deviation from 0° likely results from the angle formed by the phalloidin probe on the actin helical backbone and the flexibility of the Alexa488 link to the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref021">21</xref>]. Taken together, these data indicate that our labeling and imaging methods of actin filaments can indeed be used to quantify molecular actin order in various biological samples.</p>

<title>Molecular actin order buildup during myofibrillogenesis and sarcomere maturation</title>
<p>We next applied our method to determine F-actin order during different stages of flight muscle development. Imaging actin with the spinning disc channel confirmed that, at 18-h APF, myotubes have initiated attachment to tendons, and actin filaments form a loose meshwork, which progressively bundles into individual immature myofibrils at 32-h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). During these stages, mechanical tension strongly increases in the myotube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>], but the immature myofibrils do not yet exhibit a clear periodic actin pattern at 32-h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, from 48-h APF onwards, a periodic actin pattern is readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2D–2F</xref>). Taking advantage of this periodicity, we averaged the intensity of multiple sarcomeres to determine the average position of M-line and Z-discs and to quantify sarcomeric growth from 48-h APF on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2G–2J</xref>). We found a sarcomere length of 2.1 μm at 48-h APF, which grows to 2.7 and 3.1 μm at 72-h and 90-h APF, respectively. These length measures are in agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref024">24</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref013">13</xref>], validating our imaging and automated sarcomere detection pipeline. We found that the variability of sarcomere length within individual pupae is below 3% (SD), demonstrating a synchronous growth of all sarcomeres in all muscle fibers of each pupa. This strongly supports a self-organization mechanism that coordinates sarcomere maturation across the entire muscle fiber.</p>

<p>In order to compare the molecular actin order between the different developmental stages, we used the angular distribution width of 90-h APF flight muscles (Ψ<sub>90h</sub> = 129°; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004718.s003">S1 Data</xref>) as a reference and determined the disorder of actin ΔΨ during development, as the deviation from this reference (ΔΨ = Ψ − Ψ<sub>90h</sub>). As expected, we find a large deviation of ΔΨ = 34° from the perfect order in the loose actin filament meshwork of 18-h and 22-h APF myotubes, which does not significantly decrease during that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2K</xref>). However, from 22-h to 32-h APF, a period during which mechanical tension strongly increases and a first periodic muscle myosin pattern is detectable on the immature myofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>], we observe a strong gain in molecular actin order, with ΔΨ decreasing by 14° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2K</xref>). These immature myofibrils do not yet show an obvious periodic actin pattern at 32-h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>]). However, the observed gain in molecular order strongly suggests that actin filaments begin to organize into the parallel polar organization present in actin filaments of mature sarcomeres. This is also supported by electron microscopic analysis of 32-h APF myotubes showing parallel actomyosin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), with a regular spacing between actin and myosin filaments as revealed by cross-sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g003">Fig 3A’</xref>).</p>

<p>The actin order continues to increase dramatically, with ΔΨ reaching 8° at 48-h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2K</xref>). At this stage, the myofibrils display a regular periodic actin pattern, with a sarcomere length of 2.1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2D and 2J</xref>), suggesting that actin filaments are already highly polarized and likely cross-linked at the developing Z-discs. This is further substantiated by electron microscopy, showing highly organized parallel actomyosin filaments at regular distances, interspaced with dense Z-discs at 48-h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g003">Fig 3B and 3B’</xref>).</p>
<p>The actin order gain slows down until 72-h APF (ΔΨ decreasing by 7°), and no further statistically significant gain is detected until 90-h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004718.s003">S1 Data</xref>), although the sarcomeres grow both in length and diameter (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g003">3C and 3C’</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that molecular actin order in flight muscles increases during the formation of immature myofibrils at 32-h APF and is largely built up until 48-h APF, while during sarcomere elongation new actin subunits are added to already ordered actin filaments.</p>

<title>Simultaneous buildup of molecular actin order during early stages of myofibrillogenesis</title>
<p>Our earlier work suggested that immature myofibrils are built simultaneously throughout the developing flight muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>]. However, observations from cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro rather indicated that early and mature myofibrils are present at the same time in the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref025">25</xref>].

<title>Actin order increases at the sarcomeric Z-disc during intermediate stages of myofibrillogenesis</title>
<p>From 48-h APF onwards, we could use our image analysis protocol to automatically detect individual sarcomeres of the large flight muscle fibers and compute averaged images of sarcomeres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">Fig 2G–2I</xref>).

Additionally, measuring the average actin orientation angle ρ at the micrometer scale shows that local actin orientation is homogeneously aligned along the sarcomere main axis, with only a slight deviation towards the inner region of the Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g004">Fig 4C–4F</xref>). This is consistent with a slightly oblique orientation of thin filaments close to the Z-discs of adult flight muscles as seen by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that, despite slight differences in the speed of actin ordering within developing sarcomeres, high actin order is gained along the entire sarcomere during sarcomere maturation.</p>

<title>Essential role for nonmuscle myosin during myofibrillogenesis</title>

<p>We further investigated the stage of myofibril initiation at 32-h APF using the <italic>sqh-IR[GD7916]</italic> and <italic>zip[HMS01703]</italic> RNAi lines, which resulted in strong myofibril and sarcomere length phenotypes at 90-h APF. We found that <italic>sqh</italic> knock-down myofibers have attached to tendons at 32-h APF. However, they are overly long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g006">Fig 6A, 6C and 6G</xref>). <italic>zip</italic> knock-down also results in some abnormally long fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g006">Fig 6A, 6E and 6G</xref>) and in some unattached round fibers, which supposedly degenerate later, leading to the missing fiber phenotype at 90-h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g005">Fig 5K</xref>). The myofibrils of the overly long fibers appear largely normal when stained for actin and Mhc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g006">Fig 6B, 6D and 6F</xref>). These findings suggest that nonmuscle myosin contributes to the generation of mechanical tension before 32-h APF, which drives myofiber compaction and thus myofiber shortening during attachment maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>].</p>

<title>Nonmuscle myosin II and mechanical tension are required for actin ordering during myofibril initiation</title>

<p>As reducing nonmuscle myosin function resulted in a myofiber compaction defect and thus likely in a reduction of mechanical tension in the muscle, we investigated a different genetic alteration that results in a similar phenotype. Reducing the levels of the cell surface protein Kon-tiki (Kon) by RNAi leads to delayed myotube–tendon attachment, overly long muscle fibers, and therefore likely also a reduction of tension buildup. These fibers also show myofibrillogenesis defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>]. We found a similar reduction in molecular actin order generation by 5° in the <italic>kon</italic> knock-down muscle as in the <italic>sqh</italic> knock-down muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This strongly suggests that nonmuscle myosin and mechanical tension are both required for molecular actin ordering during myofibril initiation. By analyzing the mature 90-h APF muscles of the <italic>sqh</italic> and <italic>kon</italic> knock-down pupae, which both contain too short but regular sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g005">Fig 5</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>]), we find that most of the order gain during sarcomere maturation occurs normally in these muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Thus, despite reduced sarcomere length, actin does strongly gain molecular order in these shorter sarcomeres.</p>

<title>Muscle myosin motor-independent gain of actin order during sarcomere maturation</title>
<p>As we found a strong gain of molecular actin order during sarcomere maturation under conditions of reduced nonmuscle myosin function, we suspected an important role for muscle myosin in actin ordering. <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains a single myosin heavy chain gene, <italic>Mhc</italic>. <italic>Mhc</italic> null mutations are embryonic lethal. However, the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> allele carries a splice site mutation that specifically eliminates <italic>Mhc</italic> RNA and consequently Mhc protein isoforms from adult flight muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref033">33</xref>]. Electron microscopic analysis had shown that the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> flight muscles lack any detectable thick filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref033">33</xref>]. Using mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq), we confirmed that the flight muscle–specific isoforms affected by the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> splicing mutation are indeed the major <italic>Mhc</italic> isoforms expressed during myofibril formation and maturation stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004718.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> mutants are homozygous viable and flightless and thus perfectly suited to quantify actin order during flight muscle development.</p>
<p>In addition to the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> allele, we also analyzed muscles in which we re-expressed a headless <italic>Mhc</italic> rod construct using the flight muscle–specific <italic>Actin88F</italic> promoter in an <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> mutant background. This genetic set-up was shown to enable the assembly of actin filaments with myosin rods to sarcomere-like structures of variable length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref032">32</xref>]. It results in a flight muscle compaction defect that is comparable to the nonmuscle myosin knock-down at 32-h APF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>], suggesting that Mhc also contributes to force generation during myofibril assembly. This notion was corroborated by the finding that molecular actin order in <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> and <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic>-expressing flight muscles at 32h APF is reduced to a similar extent as in the nonmuscle myosin or <italic>kon</italic> knock-down (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">8A–8C and 8I</xref>).

<p>At 90-h APF, we reproduced the known severe myofibril and sarcomere maturation defect in the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> and <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic>-expressing flight muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8D–8F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref033">33</xref>]. Although the presence of Mhc rods supports the formation of bipolar actin filaments surrounding bright Z-disc–like structures, these filaments are poorly connected compared with the ordered wild-type myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8D and 8E</xref>). Without the Mhc rod, the actin pattern appears drastically disorganized with no detectable periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). These results confirm that muscle myosin motor activity is required for proper myofibril maturation.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that actin order buildup is still largely supported in these <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> and <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic>-expressing flight muscles during stages of myofibril and sarcomere maturation. At 90-h APF, the molecular disorder ΔΨ is only increased by 5° in <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> and by 4° in <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic>-expressing flight muscles compared with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8I</xref>). We have been able to automatically segment sarcomere-like structures in the <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic>-expressing flight muscles and find that the relative molecular disorder at the Z-disc compared with wild type is less than 3°. However, at the edges of the sarcomeres, order decays more rapidly than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8J</xref>). We conclude from these data that high molecular actin order in developing muscles can be achieved without the motor activity of muscle myosin.</p>
<p>The overall organization of myofibrils is drastically affected in <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> and in <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic> flight muscles compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8D–8F</xref>). Accordingly, we find that the collective orientation of the actin molecules per pixel as measured by ρ shows larger variation in <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> and in <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic> flight muscles at the fiber scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8D’–8F’</xref>). We quantified this variation of ρ by calculating its SD and comparing each pixel with its neighbors in a 10 μm × 10 μm square. This demonstrates that the overall actin filament orientation is more irregular in <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic> flight muscles compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">Fig 8K</xref>), suggesting that the myofibril self-organization or myofibril maturation does require muscle myosin to be coordinated across the entire muscle fiber. It also validates that our approach can detect both local molecular actin order in each pixel and global regularity of the actin orientation in the entire system, here the myofibrils. In summary, polarization-resolved microscopy enabled us to demonstrate that Mhc—and in particular the motor activity of Mhc—is largely dispensable for local order generation of actin during sarcomere maturation. However, it is required for global coordination of regular myofibril maturation throughout the developing muscles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mature muscles possess a pseudocrystalline order of their actomyosin filaments, which needs to be built up during muscle development. Although myofibrillogenesis is generally important and has been studied for many years, its molecular mechanism is not well understood. One limitation of past studies was the difficulty of quantifying molecular order of sarcomeric protein components in vivo. Here, we have applied polarization-resolved microscopy to quantify actin order buildup during myofibrillogenesis using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscle as an in vivo model system. This model is particularly well suited for studying molecular order buildup because insect flight muscle is considered the most ordered muscle in nature—it is even a suitable sample for X-ray structural studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Using polarization-resolved microscopy, we found that molecular actin order starts to build up between 22-h and 32-h APF after myotubes have attached to tendons, coinciding with the assembly of immature myofibrils. We discovered that actin molecular order is built up simultaneously throughout the entire large muscle cell. This finding challenges in vitro data, which showed different myofibril organization levels in the same cell at the same time and concluded a stepwise myofibril assembly as proposed in the premyofibril model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref025">25</xref>]. Our finding does not refute the premyofibril model; however, it does strongly support a self-organization mechanism of myofibril assembly, coordinating the assembly throughout the entire muscle cell. The same myofibril self-organization was recently also found in cultured cardiomyocytes, when cardiomyocytes were allowed to generate forces by the formation of cell-matrix adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref034">34</xref>]. In mutants with reduced muscle attachment and thus reduced force generation, order buildup is delayed, corroborating the hypothesis that mechanical tension is important for coordinating the self-organization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Mechanistically, we demonstrated that nonmuscle myosin and muscle myosin play important roles for actin ordering during the formation of immature myofibrils at 32-h APF. This is an important finding because it adds functional genetic evidence to the previously suggested early role of nonmuscle myosin during “premyofibril” formation in vertebrate myogenesis, which was largely concluded from myosin drug experiments performed with in vitro culture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref035">35</xref>]. It also provides insight into the force generation mechanism during myofibril formation, which requires stable attachment to tendons, nonmuscle myosin, and muscle myosin activity because interfering with either one results in overly long muscle fibers, with defects in actin order buildup at 32-h APF.</p>
<p>We found that most actin order buildup is completed by 48-h APF, at which stage 2.1-μm–long, regular, immature sarcomeres are present. This is a remarkable finding considering that, during the following increase in sarcomere length and in particular sarcomere diameter, the actin order gain is rather small. This is well supported by our electron microscopy images showing the regular actomyosin arrays of immature sarcomeres at 48-h APF. Mechanistically, this finding suggests that newly added actin filaments, which mediate the longitudinal growth of the sarcomere, are added in a way that respects the already present high molecular order. It also suggests that the newly added actin filaments at the periphery of the myofibrils that mediate lateral growth to expand the myofibril diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref036">36</xref>] are either already ordered or gain molecular order quickly. These findings are consistent with a model of myofibrillogenesis that proposed that muscle myosin containing thick filaments can assemble directly with cross-linked thin filaments composed of α-actinin, actin, and titin (I-Z-I bodies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref038">38</xref>]. This assembly is likely to occur laterally on the growing preassembled immature myofibril using the existing ordered actin and myosin filaments as a template. Concomitantly, both filament types grow in length to reach 3.1-μm sarcomere length at 90-h APF. If the actin order during assembly of immature myofibrils at 32-h APF is compromised, either by reducing nonmuscle myosin or mechanical tension, the defect cannot be rescued during the following sarcomere maturation steps, resulting in short nonfunctional sarcomeres at 90-h APF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that the buildup of molecular actin order in flight muscles after 32-h APF is largely independent of muscle myosin function. In both the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> splice mutant muscles as well as in <italic>Mhc[10];Mhc-rod</italic>-expressing muscles, actin is ordered almost as well as in the wild-type muscle, at least per pixel, which is the detection volume of our microscopy method. We can rule out the trivial explanation that other muscle myosin isoforms are expressed in the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> mutant flight muscle because the point mutation affects the isoforms that are predominant in the adult flight muscles as well as during flight muscle development; in addition, western blotting showed that more than 95% of Mhc protein is lost in <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> in adult flight muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref033">33</xref>]. Electron microscopy analysis showed that, in adult <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> flight muscles, Z-disc–like structures can be found—which, in some cases, are connected to periodic structures that nevertheless entirely lack thick filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref033">33</xref>]. A second argument against remaining Mhc protein activity in the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> mutants is that the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> phenotype is not enhanced by the expression of the headless myosin rod. If this construct is expressed in wild-type muscle, it creates a dominant negative phenotype, resulting in the fragmentation of the myofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref032">32</xref>]. In contrast, expression of the Mhc rod in the <italic>Mhc[10]</italic> mutant results in a milder myofibril phenotype with clearly visible, sarcomere-like structures that are often connected with the headless myosin rods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref032">32</xref>]. Together, these data provide strong arguments that muscle myosin is largely dispensable for local order generation of actin during myofibril and sarcomere maturation. Thus, other actin cross-linkers—like α-actinin, the ZASP family of proteins, and in particular the different <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin isoforms Kettin, Sallimus, or Projectin—are likely candidates contributing to actin ordering from the Z-disc. This would fit our observation that actin order is higher at the Z-disc in forming sarcomeres at 48-h APF. All these Z-disc proteins play an important role during sarcomerogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref041">41</xref>], but testing their role in molecular actin or myosin order buildup will be a challenge for the future.</p>
<p>Despite the buildup of local molecular actin order in the muscle myosin mutants, we found that the actin order orientation along the muscle and sarcomere axis is severely perturbed. This demonstrates that myosin motor activity is required to globally order the actin filaments along the future contraction axis of the muscle fiber. This is in accordance with recent data demonstrating that myosin-mediated muscle contractions are required for higher muscle-fiber–wide orientation of the actomyosin filaments resulting in cross-striated muscle fibers, with all myofibrils aligned along the lateral muscle axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref042">42</xref>]. These myosin-dependent higher order assemblies are not restricted to muscle cells but can also be found in stress fibers of nonmuscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref043">43</xref>], again suggesting that myosin contractility is required for the global self-organization of a regular periodic actomyosin pattern throughout the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Taking these data together, we suggest the following updated model for in vivo myofibrillogenesis and sarcomere maturation.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Immature myofibrils assemble simultaneously throughout the entire muscle fiber. This step requires muscle attachment and the buildup of mechanical tension, which coordinates the self-organization of actin, myosin, and titin filaments into early immature myofibrils. This first step generates significant molecular order of actin, which depends on the function of both nonmuscle and muscle myosin, both of which contribute to the mechanical force generation resulting in myofiber compaction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>During sarcomere maturation, sarcomere length and diameter increase simultaneously across all sarcomeres of the muscle cell, again coordinated by a self-organization mechanism. The incorporation of new filament subunits maintains the preformed high molecular order of actin and myosin filaments.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Muscle myosin motor activity is required for the global self-organization of the periodic sarcomeric series into linear periodic myofibrils but is largely dispensable for local molecular actin ordering, which must therefore be achieved by alternative mechanisms. As most sarcomeric components as well as the global organizational principles of sarcomeres and myofibrils are conserved from flies to mammals, this model should also be relevant to mammalian muscle morphogenesis.</p></list-item>

<p>Pupae were staged and dissected as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref047">47</xref>]. Briefly, pupae were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBST (PBS plus 0.3% TritonX) at room temperature (RT) and washed in PBST. Pupae 90-h APF were then cut sagittally using a microtome blade. Dissected pupae were blocked for 30 min with normal goat serum (1:30), stained with mouse anti-Mhc 1:100 (J. Saide, Boston University, Boston, MA) overnight (ON) at 4 °C, and washed 3 times in PBST. Secondary antibodies (1:500) and rhodamine phalloidin (1:500) (both from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added for 2 h at RT, followed by 3 washing steps in PBST before samples were embedded in Vectashield. For the polarization-resolved microscopy, pupae were only stained with Alexa488–phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at RT, washed, and embedded. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 780 and processed with Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref048">48</xref>] and Photoshop.</p>

<title>Polarization-resolved fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>The optical set-up, described in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref050">50</xref>], is based on a confocal spinning disk unit (CSU-X1-M1; Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan) connected to the side port of an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti-U; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The laser excitation is provided by a polarized 488-nm continuous laser (Sapphire 488–20; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) whose power is controlled. The laser beam is sent into an electro-optic modulator (EOM) (Pockels cell, No 28-NP; Quantum Technology, Lake Mary, FL) followed by a quarter wave plate (WPQ05M-488; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) for production of a linear rotating polarization. A polarization distortion compensator is used to compensate for ellipticity and diattenuation produced by the optics in the excitation path towards the microscope objective, which are characterized preliminarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref050">50</xref>]. The beam is then expanded using a 10× telescope (BE10; Thorlabs) and sent directly to the microlens array of the CSU by reflection in its dichroic mirror (Di01-T488-13×15×0.5; Semrock, Rochester, NY). An objective lens (Nikon Plan Apo VC 60×, N.A. = 1.2, water immersion) is used for excitation and light collection. The detection is then filtered (bandpass 525/45) and imaged onto a camera (iXon 897 EMCCD, 512×512 pixels; Andor, Belfast, United Kingdom). The microlens and pinhole array of the CSU disks rotate synchronously at a speed of 1,800 rpm, while the EMCCD and EOM are synchronized to ensure a fast stack recording for a given number of incident polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref050">50</xref>]. A frame rate of 30 ms per image and 10 polarization angles measured leads to a typical rate of 1 polarization stack recorded per second.</p>

<title>Molecular order angle</title>
<p>Inside the confocal volume, each Alexa488–phalloidin molecule exhibits an absorption dipole vector <bold><italic>μ</italic></bold><sub><italic>abs</italic></sub> with an orientation (<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>φ</italic>) in 3D. Fluorescence is generated from the coupling of these dipoles with the incident linear polarization <bold><italic>E</italic></bold>(<italic>α</italic>), which makes an angle <italic>α</italic> with the horizontal axis <italic>x</italic> of the sample plane. The recorded fluorescence intensity is proportional to the absorption probability <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>abs</italic></sub> = |<bold><italic>μ</italic></bold><sub><italic>abs</italic></sub>(<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>φ</italic>).<bold><italic>E</italic></bold>(<italic>α</italic>)|<sup>2</sup>. The total intensity buildup from the incoherent emission from all molecules, during the time of the measurement over which they might fluctuate in orientation, results in an angular integration over all angles explored in time and space: <italic>I</italic>(<italic>α</italic>) = <italic>∫∫</italic>|<bold><italic>μ</italic></bold><sub><italic>abs</italic></sub>(<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>φ</italic>).<bold><italic>E</italic></bold>(<italic>α</italic>)|<sup>2</sup> sin <italic>θdθdφ</italic>. This expression shows that the signal is modulated in <italic>α</italic> when the absorption dipoles of the fluorescence probes are aligned, e.g., when they do not experience an isotropic distribution. We assume that the orientations explored by molecular dipoles are constrained within an angular cone total aperture angle <italic>ψ</italic>, oriented in the sample plane along the direction <italic>ρ</italic> relative to X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Physically, <italic>ψ</italic> determines the degree of angular variations present within the focal spot at a given pixel position. This angle, denoted “molecular order”, encompasses the orientation variations among probes (related to the static organization of actin filaments) as well as their time angular fluctuations (related to the degrees of freedom relative to their binding site). <italic>ρ</italic>, on the other hand, determines the preferential orientation of the probes. <italic>ρ</italic> and <italic>ψ</italic> thus permit us to quantify the full information on molecular organization at each pixel of an image (typically of size 300 nm × 300 nm).</p>
<p>In practice, (<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) are deduced from the measurement of the intensity modulation <italic>I</italic>(<italic>α</italic>). This is done by decomposing the dependence of the intensity <italic>I</italic>(<italic>α</italic>) as a function of (<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) in a modulation form: <italic>I</italic>(<italic>α</italic>) = <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) cos 2<italic>α</italic> + <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) sin 2<italic>α</italic>. <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) and <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) are the intensity modulation coefficients. Their relation to (<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) are computed numerically, accounting for possible polarization distortions of <bold><italic>E</italic></bold>(<italic>α</italic>), which permit us to retrieve (<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) from the measurement of (<italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>) at each pixel position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004718.ref018">18</xref>]. In practice, these coefficients are measured from the computation of <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> = 2/<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> ∑<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>I</italic>(<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) cos 2<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub> = 2/<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> ∑<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>I</italic>(<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) sin 2<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, using <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> = ∑<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>I</italic>(<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) the total intensity and <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> the angles used for the polarization-resolved measurements (typically <italic>k</italic> = 1..10 and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 0°…180°). (<italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>ψ</italic>) are finally represented in a map that combines molecular order and orientation.</p>

<title>Threshold image</title>
<p>After having manually selected the area of interest in a raw intensity image, we applied a smooth filter on the raw image and divided the raw image by the filtered one. Local actin-rich areas compared to their vicinity result in a value greater than 1. A threshold around 1 permits us to obtain a binary mask corresponding to actin filaments. At 48-h, 72-h, and 90-h APF, the threshold discards M-lines due to low actin signal from the binary mask.</p>

<title>Automatized segmentation method</title>
<p>We detected all objects (connected areas) within the binary mask. We then used the method “regionprops” of Matlab to fit every object as an ellipse and detected sarcomeres by applying criteria on the geometrical property of the object. These criteria are based on the convexity of the object, the area of the object, and the ratio between the major and minor axes of the fitting ellipse. Minimal and maximal values of each criterion depend on the age of the pupae. This process has been applied to get data for Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g002">2G–2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g004">4C–4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g007">7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004718.g008">8G, 8H, 8J and 8K</xref>.</p>
