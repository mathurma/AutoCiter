<abstract>
<p>Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) has been associated with glioma stemness, but the direct molecular mechanism linking the two is largely unknown. Here, we show that EGFRvIII induces the expression and secretion of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) via activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), thereby promoting self-renewal and tumor progression of glioma stem cells (GSCs). Mechanistically, PEDF sustained GSC self-renewal by Notch1 cleavage, and the generated intracellular domain of Notch1 (NICD) induced the expression of Sox2 through interaction with its promoter region. Furthermore, a subpopulation with high levels of PEDF was capable of infiltration along corpus callosum. Inhibition of PEDF diminished GSC self-renewal and increased survival of orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. Together, these data indicate the novel role of PEDF as a key regulator of GSC and suggest clinical implications.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Malignant gliomas are among the most lethal types of cancer, due in part to the stem-cell-like characteristics and invasive properties of the brain tumor cells. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern such processes. Here, we identify pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) as a critical factor controlling stemness and tumor progression in glioma stem cells. We found that PEDF is secreted from glioblastoma expressing EGFRvIII, a frequently occurring mutation in primary glioblastoma that yields a permanently activated epidermal growth factor receptor. We delineate an EGFRvIII-STAT3-PEDF signaling axis as a signature profile of highly malignant gliomas, which promotes self-renewal of glioma stem cells. Our results demonstrate a previously unprecedented function of PEDF and implicate potential therapeutic approaches against malignant gliomas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite multimodal treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis of GBM is poor, with a median overall survival of 14 mo and 2-y survival rates of less than 10% [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Failure of GBM treatment is attributed in part to the widespread infiltration of tumor cells into the normal brain parenchyma, leading to inevitable tumor recurrence, as well as GBM’s resistance to standard therapeutics [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that glioma stem cells (GSCs) might contribute to multiple aspects of GBM tumor biology, including the initiation, progression, diffusive infiltration, recurrence, and drug resistance of glioma [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The xenograft models of GSCs recapitulate clinical features of glioma infiltration, such as migration along white-matter tracts, perivascular spread, and subpial growth [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. GSCs isolated from human tumors show remarkable similarities to neural stem cells (NSCs) as GSCs express markers for neural stem/progenitors, such as Nestin and Sox2, and harness the ability to grow as nonadherent spheres when cultured in serum-free conditions containing the defined growth factors [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Upon serum induction, such GSCs differentiate into cells of neuronal or glial lineages and lose stemness as well as tumorigenicity [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, transient exposure of GSCs to bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), a well-known differentiation factor, abolishes the tumor initiating and infiltrating potential [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, primary GBM cells that are enriched with GSCs, but not the traditional glioma lines grown in standard serum-containing culture conditions, closely mirror the genotype of parental tumors and yield tumors with a highly infiltrative phenotype when orthotopically implanted into immunodeficient mice [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These studies suggest that tumor initiation and the infiltrative phenotype of glioma cells are associated with stemness.</p>
<p>EGFRvIII, a frequently occurring mutation in primary glioblastoma, results in a protein that is unable to bind any known ligand. Although controversial, EGFRvIII expression in patients has been associated with poor prognosis as well as resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite the loss of ligand-binding ability, EGFRvIII is known to transmit a low level of constitutive signaling leading to the activation of pro-oncogenic signaling molecules such as AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and STATs in GBM and breast cancers [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Intriguingly, expression of EGFRvIII positively correlates with the expression of stem/progenitor markers, including Nestin, Sox2, and CD133, and is associated with an enhanced ability to self-renew and initiate tumor [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As EGFR signaling is one of the most well-known therapeutic targets and autocrine signaling has increasingly been implicated in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenicity of various malignancies, including gliomas [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we tested the possibility that autocrine signaling in GSCs plays a part in the regulation of the self-renewal property of EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> infiltrative GSCs. Here, we show that EGFRvIII contributes to the self-renewal and tumor-initiating ability of GSCs in part via inducing PEDF, an autocrine factor that has been shown to be expressed in the NSC niche.</p>

<title>EGFRvIII Expression Maintains Stemness of GSCs</title>
<p>To investigate the possible role of EGFRvIII in the regulation of GSC stemness, we first classified EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> or EGFRvIII<sup>-</sup> cells based on the results from semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). EGFRvIII transcript was detected in ten out of 13 GSCs (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In two of such EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> cells, CSC2 and X01, we examined whether EGFRvIII expression was modulated during differentiation of GSCs. Upon the induction of differentiation by serum, CSC2 and X01 cells revealed down-regulation of Sox2 and Nestin, markers for undifferentiated cells, with concurrent increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for differentiation (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B–1E</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002152.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Importantly, the level of EGFRvIII was gradually reduced after serum treatment and finally became undetectable by day 9 (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In sharp contrast, expression levels of the EGFR wild type (EGFR-WT) in these two cells were up-regulated over time (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These results suggest that EGFRvIII might be associated with GSC maintenance.</p>

<p>To investigate the functional role of EGFRvIII in the maintenance of GSCs, we selectively inhibited EGFRvIII by expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) against EGFRvIII (siEGFRvIII) and assessed for changes in the expression of stemness markers and the ability to form spheres. EGFRvIII knockdown significantly reduced the levels of Sox2 and Nestin while increasing GFAP level in CSC2 cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F–1H</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002152.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>).

<title>Identification of PEDF as a Novel Autocrine Factor Regulated by EGFRvIII through STAT3 Signaling</title>
<p>When we collected conditioned media (CM) from GSC cultures grown in serum-free conditions (serum-free GSC-CM) and added the CM to CSC2 cultures, sphere formation of CSC2 cells was enhanced. By contrast, sphere formation was drastically prevented when CM from CSC2 cultures grown in the presence of serum (serum-CM) was added (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). These results suggest that soluble factors in serum-free GSC CM, secreted by GSCs under the control of EGFRvIII, might potentiate sphere formation and glioma stemness. To identify secreted factors that might regulate EGFRvIII-dependent glioma stemness, we used LC-MS/MS to compare the secreted proteins between serum-free GSC-CM and serum-CM of CSC2 cells and between serum-free GSC-CM from CSC2 (EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> GSC) and Ex Vivo (EGFRvIII<sup>-</sup> GSC) (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). We extracted commonly enriched proteins in serum-free GSC-CM but not in others. Among those proteins, PEDF was the only secretory protein. Based on these results, we chose PEDF as the strongest candidate ligand for the maintenance of GSCs (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>PEDF has been identified as a secretory protein which is implicated as a niche factor of NSCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Using three different GSCs (CSC2, X01, and X02), we confirmed that serum induced the expression of an astrocytic differentiation marker GFAP but decreased the levels of PEDF and NSC markers, Nestin and Sox2 (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). The fact that PEDF-silenced GSC-CM lost sphere forming ability in CSC2 cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) further raises the possibility of PEDF as a stemness factor. When EGFRvIII was depleted in CSC2 and X01 cells, PEDF expression was greatly reduced (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), suggesting PEDF as a possible downstream factor of EGFRvIII signaling. Conversely, depletion or overexpression of EGFR-WT in CSC2 and X01 cells did not affect PEDF expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>). Moreover, we found that EGFRvIII, but not EGFR-WT, increased the expression levels of PEDF and the markers for NSC stemness in X02 (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>). These results strongly support the possibility of PEDF as downstream mediator of EGFRvIII-induced stemness of GSCs.</p>
<p>STAT3 signaling has been shown to play a crucial role in controlling the stemness of GSCs induced by EGFRvIII [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To further elucidate the functional involvement of STAT3 in EGFRvIII-induced PEDF expression, we modulated EGFR expression in GSCs and analyzed the activation of STAT3. Silencing of EGFRvIII decreased total STAT3 expression and blocked STAT3 activation and PEDF expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), whereas silencing of EGFR-WT did not (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). When STAT3 signaling was blocked by either a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activation (Stattic, 5 μM) or a STAT3-specific siRNA, we observed decreased expression of PEDF (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I–2K</xref>). To verify possible involvement of other downstream signaling of EGFRvIII, we further examined AKT and ERK activation after EGFRvIII silencing (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>) and overexpression (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). Although there were slight effects of siEGFRvIII on AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, EGFRvIII overexpression could not induce AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GSCs. Furthermore, inhibitor treatment for ERK and AKT activation did not show any change in PEDF expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that EGFRvIII/STAT3 signaling might be a major pathway for PEDF expression in GSCs. Taken together, these data suggest that PEDF is a soluble factor secreted by GSCs and that PEDF expression and subsequent secretion is regulated by EGFRvIII through STAT3 signaling.</p>

<title>PEDF Promotes Stemness and Self-renewal of GSCs</title>
<p>To determine the involvement of PEDF in maintaining glioma stemness, we treated X02 cells with recombinant PEDF in serum-free GSC medium, performed sphere-forming assays, and examined the levels of stem cell markers. Our results revealed that recombinant PEDF significantly and dose-dependently increased sphere formation (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>), increased NSC markers expression, and decreased the level of GFAP in these X02 cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). In X01 cells cultured in serum-free GSC medium, withdrawal of growth factors (EGF and basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) from the medium caused a reduction in sphere formation (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). In these cells, the levels of PEDF and Nestin and Sox2 were decreased, while GFAP expression was elevated (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Importantly, addition of recombinant PEDF into the serum-free GSC medium lacking EGF and bFGF restored sphere formation (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) and induced Nestin and Sox2 expression in X01, X04, and X06 cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002152.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B</xref> Fig). These results indicate that extracellular PEDF plays an important role in the induction and/or the maintenance of the self-renewal property of GSCs.</p>

<p>Next, we altered the levels of PEDF in various GSCs and assessed their sphere-forming ability and expression of stemness markers. In CSC2 and X01 cells, which express high levels of PEDF under normal culture conditions (see <xref rid="pbio.1002152.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), PEDF knockdown prevented sphere formation and reduced the levels of Nestin and Sox2 while increasing GFAP expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A–4D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002152.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A–S4D Fig</xref>). Since we designed short hairpin RNA of PEDF (shPEDF) to target the 3ʹUTR region, we conducted a rescue experiment by overexpressing a PEDF construct that does not contain the 3ʹUTR. As we expected, overexpression of PEDF rescued the glioma stemness and sphere-forming ability of PEDF-silenced GSCs (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A–4D</xref>). Conversely, in X02 cells, PEDF overexpression promoted sphere formation and induced the expression of Nestin and Sox2, while GFAP expression was decreased (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="pbio.1002152.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J–1M</xref>, overexpression of EGFRvIII in X02 cells promoted sphere formation and induced the expression of Nestin and Sox2. Importantly, we found that knocking down PEDF in X02 cells overexpressing EGFRvIII completely prevented sphere formation, down-regulated the NSC markers (Nestin and Sox2), and up-regulated GFAP (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). These results further support the notion that PEDF promotes self-renewal of GSCs and that PEDF function is regulated by the EGFRvIII-STAT3 axis.</p>

<title>PEDF Maintains Stemness and Self-renewal of GSCs by Activating Notch-Sox2 Pathway</title>
<p>PEDF was originally identified as an antiangiogenic factor [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Subsequent studies have shown pleotropic effects mediated by PEDF, suggesting that PEDF is regulated in cell context-dependent manners. A previous study has suggested that PEDF plays a role in the neurovascular niches to control stem-cell maintenance through activation of Notch signaling [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Similarly, overexpression and knockdown of PEDF resulted in the accumulation and depletion of NICD, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of the γ-secretase activity by N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) essentially abolished the effects of PEDF on NICD generation (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) and sphere formation (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>).

<p>To further establish the link between PEDF signaling and GSC stemness, we examined the downstream effectors of NICD in GSCs. A previous study has shown that NICD induces the expression of Sox2 in NSCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In GSCs, we detected an increase in Sox2 expression in response to PEDF, an effect that was blocked by γ-secretase inhibition (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). As <italic>Sox2</italic> promoter contains two putative CBF1-binding sites (TGGGAA) in the -1 kb region of the transcriptional start site [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and the mRNA level of Sox2 correlated with PEDF expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to examine whether <italic>Sox2</italic> gene was directly regulated by NICD.

We found that the level of PEDF was higher in CSC2, X01, X03, X04, X06, X08, and X09 cells as compared to that in X02, Ex Vivo, and 528NS cells. Among the 13 GSCs, three GSCs, MD30, 1123NS and 83NS, expressed EGFRvIII, but there was no STAT3 phosphorylation. Consistent with the notion that STAT3 signaling is crucial for PEDF expression, these cells did not express PEDF. EGFRvIII expression was also confirmed by using EGFRvIII specific antibody (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the tumorigenic role of PEDF in GSCs, we orthotopically injected 13 different GSC lines into nude mice. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002152.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>, EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup>/PEDF<sup>high</sup> GSCs (CSC2, X01, X03, X04, X06, X08, and X09) formed brain tumors and exhibited highly infiltrative phenotypes (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002152.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). By contrast, X02 cells lacking EGFRvIII failed to induce brain tumor formation within 2 mo. These infiltrating tumor cells showed activation of EGFRvIII/STAT3 signaling and expression of stemness markers (Nestin and Sox2) in vivo (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). In contrast, Ex Vivo and 528NS cells induced the formation of tumors, but these tumors were noninfiltrative (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Importantly, the EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup>/PEDF<sup>low</sup> GSCs (MD30, 1123NS, and 83NS) induced tumor formation, but these tumors again were noninfiltrative, highlighting that only EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup>/PEDF<sup>high</sup> cells are capable of inducing infiltration (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). However, Ki-67 and Nestin expression did not significantly differ among the groups of GSCs, indicating that both groups exhibited similar mitotic activity and glioma stemness (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we orthotopically implanted GFP-labeled X01 control or X01-PEDF-KD GSCs into nude mice. Control GSCs showed an infiltration phenotype, displaying invasion through the corpus callosum. In contrast, depletion of PEDF in GSCs significantly inhibited infiltration (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). We then compared survival rates of mice by intracranial injection. Depletion of PEDF in GSCs significantly increased mice survival rate compared to the control GSCs (10<sup>4</sup> cells), and this finding was more evident when smaller number of cells were injected (10<sup>3</sup> cells) (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). H&amp;E staining showed that control GSCs formed tumor mass at the injected site and infiltrated to the other half of the brain through the corpus callosum (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>). Depletion of PEDF significantly decreased expression levels of Sox2, NICD, and Hes1 and caused GSCs to form tumor mass that was more restricted to the injection site (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further analyze the potential gain of function, we overexpressed PEDF in noninfiltrating GSCs (MD30, 1123NS, 83NS, and Ex Vivo). Overexpression of PEDF increased tumor size and infiltrative phenotype (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002152.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). However, infiltrative phenotype was only observed in Ex Vivo. PEDF-overexpressing Ex Vivo showed local infiltration from injection site (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7Fb and 7Fd</xref>), myelin-associated infiltration in the corpus callosum (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7Ff</xref>), and tumor growth at a distance from the injection site (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7Fh</xref>) compared with control (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7Fa, 7Fc, 7Fe and 7Fg</xref>). Since several molecules were previously suggested as candidate receptors for PEDF, we confirmed the presence of those molecules in our GSCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002152.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A Fig</xref>, PNPLA2, LRP6, and PLXDC1 were expressed in all of the tested GSCs, whereas PLXDC2 was not. Specific siRNA knockdown of the individual PEDF receptors failed to affect the stemness, differentiation marker expression, and sphere formation ability of our GSCs (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9B–S9D Fig</xref>). These results suggest another receptor for PEDF might regulate the stemness and tumor progression of GSCs.</p>
<p>To address the functional association between EGFRvIII and PEDF in vivo, we orthotopically injected X02 cells overexpressing EGFRvIII into nude mice. Injection of X02 cells overexpressing EGFRvIII significantly reduced survival rate as compared to mice injected with control X02 cells. Knocking down PEDF in X02 cells overexpressing EGFRvIII significantly increased survival rates similar to X02 control (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>). These results suggest that EGFRvIII/PEDF signaling plays an important role in the tumorigenicity and infiltration of GSCs.</p>

<title>PEDF Expression Correlates with Patient Survival in Human Glioma</title>
<p>Given the role of PEDF in controlling the ability of GSCs to self-renew and infiltrate, we analyzed the possible relationship between PEDF expression and prognosis in glioma patients using the REMBRANDT (REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa) dataset. In all glioma, we found that 3-fold down-regulation of PEDF expression (81 out of 254 patients) correlated with a better survival rate (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and low expression of PEDF showed increased survival rate in patients with GBMs and astrocytoma (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<p>In conclusion, we reveal that EGFRvIII induces the secretion of PEDF, which, in turn, activates Notch signaling that elevates Sox2 expression, leading to self-renewal and infiltration of GSCs. These results implicate that EGFRvIII-PEDF-Notch-Sox2 signaling is a crucial regulatory node that contributes to the tumor propagation and invasion, and they additionally provide a basis for future therapeutic approaches against highly infiltrative gliomas (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Human gliomas are notorious for their diffuse infiltration into normal brain tissues [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Many reports have suggested that GSCs are involved in this process [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but the cellular identity of the infiltrating glioma cells and the mechanisms responsible for maintaining their stemness remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup>/PEDF<sup>high</sup> GSCs are responsible for glioma infiltration, and that PEDF, an autocrine factor secreted by GSCs, promotes self-renewal and tumorigenic and infiltrative properties of GSCs. Moreover, we show that PEDF maintains glioma stemness and self-renewal ability by activating Notch/Sox2 signaling, and silencing of PEDF decreases the infiltration of GSCs and increases the survival of tumor-bearing mice. These results collectively suggest that inhibition of the PEDF signaling pathway may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for combating the infiltration of GSCs.</p>
<p>EGFRvIII, the most frequently occurring EGFR mutation in primary glioblastoma, encodes a protein product that constitutively signals regardless of EGF ligand. Previous studies showed that 24%–67% of GBM samples harbored EGFRvIII mutations, whereas this mutation was absent from normal tissues [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. EGFRvIII signaling has been shown to be important in driving tumor progression and is often correlated with poor prognosis [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Glioma cells expressing EGFRvIII were found to recruit EGFR-WT-expressing cells and accelerate glioma tumorigenicity by up-regulating the expression levels of cytokines (e.g., interleukin 6 [IL6] and/or leukemia inhibitory factor) [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. EGFRvIII expression has been reported to be sporadic or focal to the cancer area, and EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> cells have been shown to drive tumorigenesis by regulating other cell types [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, recent studies showed that EGFRvIII expression correlates with GSC markers (e.g., CD133) and confers resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These previous findings collectively suggest that EGFRvIII might have functional significance in the regulation of glioma stemness, but the molecular mechanisms linking the EGFRvIII and stemness or infiltration are not clearly understood. In the present study, we found that EGFRvIII expression correlates with GSC stemness during differentiation. Moreover, the loss of EGFRvIII was associated with losses of self-renewal and GSC markers, whereas EGFRvIII overexpression increased tumor formation and decreased survival rates in an orthotopic xenograft model. Our results strongly support the notion that EGFRvIII expression can drive glioma progression and infiltration by increasing GSCs. Recently, EGFRvIII vaccination has been suggested as a promising therapeutic option for EGFRvIII-mutation-bearing patients, with vaccinated patients showing significant increases in overall and progression-free survival (PFS) [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The remaining challenges will include efforts to increase response rate and overcome acquired resistance. Interestingly, samples of recurring tumors did not show any significant expression of EGFRvIII, suggesting the existence of a possible resistance mechanism against EGFRvIII vaccination. In the present paper, we demonstrate that PEDF signaling acts as a downstream regulator of EGFRvIII-induced glioma stemness and that PEDF expression can functionally replace EGFRvIII. In the future, it will be exciting to address whether PEDF expression contributes to resistance against the EGFRvIII vaccination.</p>
<p>Like NSCs, it has been suggested that the GSCs reside in a niche microenvironment including perivascular and hypoxic locations and remain in a stem cell-like status [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The niche microenvironment generates extrinsic factors that maintain stemness and direct stem cell behavior [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Various soluble factors that are involved in neuronal development and known to regulate NSC self-renewal (e.g., Sonic hedgehog, Wingless-type proteins, and fibroblast growth factor) [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] have also been implicated as a critical inducers of glioma stemness and tumorigenicity [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the adult brain, NSC migration is limited: neuroblasts migrate to the olfactory bulb, and two stemness regions (the SVZ and dentate gyrus [DG] of the hippocampus) are involved in very limited migrations of adult NSCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In contrast, many studies have found that GSCs show extensive infiltrations into the corpus callosum, cortex, subpial space, and meninges without any extracellular stimulus in orthotopic xenografts [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This suggests that GSCs might have the ability to maintain self-renewal and stemness in a non-niche environment. In this study, we identify PEDF as an autocrine factor from GSCs that is expressed in response to EGFRvIII and STAT3 phosphorylation. Silencing of PEDF clearly decreased infiltrating GSCs along the corpus callosum. Multiple functions of PEDF have been discovered: it has been demonstrated [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] to be a survival factor against oxidative stress [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], a regulator of immune-cell migration [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and a possible self-renewal factor in NSCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, functions of PEDF in tumor were known to include acting as an antitumorigenic agent by blocking angiogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In contrast to the known function of PEDF in tumor cells, we herein demonstrated that PEDF is secreted from GSCs and promotes self-renewal activity as an autocrine factor in infiltrating GSCs. Furthermore, we manifested that knockdown of PEDF expression did not changed microvessels in in vivo tumor tissue (<xref rid="pbio.1002152.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest PEDF as a novel tumorigenic factor that could act as a key regulator of self-niche for the infiltrating GSCs.</p>
<p>There are many similarities in the growth characteristics and gene expression profiles of NSCs and GSCs, suggesting that similar signaling pathways could be required for their survival and growth. Notch signaling is known to promote the self-renewal ability of NSCs and to inhibit differentiation of NSCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The Notch signaling cascade was elevated in GSCs and found to regulate GSC self-renewal and tumorigenicity [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Importantly, Notch signaling promotes the radioresistance of GSCs, whereas inhibition of Notch signaling depletes GSCs and tumorigenicity [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Our present results suggest that PEDF regulates Notch signaling and is involved in GSC self-renewal. Furthermore, we observed a very tight positive correlation between the protein expression levels of PEDF and NICD in our GBM patient samples, suggesting that Notch signaling may be important to the progression of glioblastoma. Activated NICD directly regulates transcription of the <italic>Sox2</italic> gene, which suggests that (at least in GSCs) PEDF promotes Notch cleavage and strengthens its transcriptional effects. Sox2 was previously shown to be a direct target of Notch and to regulate the self-renewal and maintenance of NSCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is the first report, to our knowledge, to show that PEDF regulates the Notch-Sox2 signaling axis involved in GSC self-renewal and maintenance. Sox2 is an essential driver of stem-like populations in multiple malignancies, and recent papers have suggested that Sox2 is a member of a core set of neurodevelopmental transcription factors (TFs) that are essential for GBM propagation and can reprogram differentiated GBM cells into “induced” GSCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p>
<p>In our xenograft model, the infiltrative phenotypes of the GSCs were strongly correlated with EGFRvIII expression. EGFRvIII is known to drive glioma infiltration in EGFRvIII overexpressing mice, wherein tumor cells infiltrate along white matter tracts (e.g., the corpus callosum) and the perivascular space [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Consistent with these results, we found that EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> GSCs showed high-level infiltration along the corpus callosum and the perivascular space. However, not all of the EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> GSCs were found to be infiltrative in the present work. Three out of ten GSC lines expressed EGFRvIII but failed to form any infiltrative glioma. These GSCs did not express PEDF, suggesting that it might be a key downstream factor for EGFRvIII-dependent glioma infiltration. Consistent with this notion, overexpression of EGFRvIII in EGFRvIII<sup>-</sup> GSCs increased tumor formation and decreased survival rates in our xenograft mode, and this phenomenon was rescued by down-regulation of PEDF. Furthermore, overexpression of PEDF in noninfiltrative EGFRvIII<sup>-</sup> GSCs (Ex Vivo) confers infiltrative nature in the brain parenchyma. Collectively, these data indicate that EGFRvIII-regulated PEDF increases the tumorigenicity and self-renewal capacity of infiltrative GSCs. We speculate that the differences in PEDF expression between the generated EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> cells might arise from variations in downstream signaling. STAT3 has been suggested to be one of the most important downstream signaling partners of EGFRvIII in tumorigenesis, and many studies have implicated EGFRvIII-STAT3 signaling in the progression of glioblastoma [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here, we found that seven of the ten EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> GSCs (CSC2, X01, X03, X04, X06, X08, and X09) activated STAT3 and further promoted the self-renewal capacity of GSCs through autocrine secretion of PEDF. In contrast, the remaining three EGFRvIII<sup>+</sup> GSCs (MD30, 1123NS and 83NS) did not show STAT3 activation or glioma infiltration. These results suggest that EGFRvIII-induced PEDF expression is mediated by the activation of STAT3 and that EGFRvIII/STAT3/PEDF signaling regulates the self-renewal of infiltrative GSCs.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of CSCs is the tumorigenic potential that arises from a small number of cells. Fewer than 100 GSCs reportedly initiated tumor formation in an in vivo xenograft model representing an original patient phenotype, whereas non-GSCs (even at 10<sup>5</sup> cells) failed to cause tumor formation in the same mouse model [<xref rid="pbio.1002152.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In the present study, we show that silencing of PEDF significantly increased survival and decreased GSC infiltration in a mouse model. The requirement of PEDF for tumorigenesis was greater in 10<sup>3</sup> cell-injected xenografts compared to those injected with 10<sup>4</sup> cells. These results indicate that PEDF specifically regulates the ability of a small number of GSCs to initiate tumors in the mouse brain. Together, our findings strongly suggest that PEDF may be a crucial therapeutic target, as well as an indicator for the tumorigenicity of infiltrative GSCs.</p>
<p>As expected, these results are consistent with REMBRANDT glioma patient survival data. Since grade of glioma infiltration starts from low grade [World Health Organization (WHO) grade II], the level of PEDF correlated from grade II glioma to grade IV GBM. Taken together, these findings suggest that PEDF may be an indicator of infiltrative GSCs and a prognostic marker of low grade glioma and that it could be a crucial therapeutic target for the future treatment of glioma.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we herein demonstrate that EGFRvIII promotes PEDF secretion, thereby activating Notch signaling and triggering the regulation of Sox2 expression. Our observations suggest that EGFRvIII-induced self-niche formation regulates the self-renewal and infiltrative ability of GSCs and offer PEDF as a candidate therapeutic target for infiltrating glioma. Further studies will be needed to identify the relevant functional domains of PEDF and determine its extracellular binding partner(s) during the regulation of GSCs.</p>

<title>SDS-PAGE and In-gel Tryptic Digestion</title>
<p>Acetone precipitated protein were run on SDS-PAGE gel (NuPAGE Novex 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), followed by staining with Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen). SDS-PAGE gel was sliced into eight pieces for in-gel tryptic digestion, according to the manufacturer's instructions using in-gel tryptic digestion kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, Illinois). Briefly, the excised gels were destained, reduced by TCEP (Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine), and alkylated by idoacetamide (IAA). The alkylated gel pieces were dehydrated in 100% ACN and digested with MS grade trypsin in 25 mM NH4CO3 for 12 h at 30°C. Digested peptides were evaporated from the liquid using vacuum concentrator and cleaned up using C18 spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for MS analysis.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS Analysis and Database Search</title>
<p>The tryptic digested peptides were analyzed by a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tryptic peptides were loaded onto trap column (100 μm x 2 cm) packed with Acclaim PepMap100 C18 resin in which loaded peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 5% to 30% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) for 120 min at a flow rate 300 nL/min. The eluted peptides, separated by the analytical column (75 μm x 15 cm), were sprayed into nano-ESI source with an electrospray voltage of 2.4 kV. The Q Exactive Orbitrap mass analyzer was operated in a top 10 data-dependent method. Full MS scans were acquired over the range m/z 300–2000 with mass resolution of 70,000 (at m/z 200). The AGC target value was 1.00E + 06. The ten most intense peaks with charge state ≥2 were fragmented in the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) collision cell with normalized collision energy of 25%, and tandem mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a mass resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200.</p>

<title>Database search</title>
<p>Database searching of all raw data files was performed in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MASCOT 2.3.2 and SEQUEST were used for database searching against the Uniprot database. Database searching against the corresponding reversed database was also performed to evaluate the false discovery rate (FDR) of peptide identification. The database searching parameters included up to two missed cleavages allowed for full tryptic digestion, precursor ion mass tolerance 10 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance 0.02 Da, fixed modification for carbamidomethyl cysteine, and variable modifications for methionine oxidation and N/Q deamination. We obtained a FDR of less than 1% on the peptide level and filtered with the high peptide confidence.</p>

<title>Histology and Immunohistochemical Staining</title>
<p>To allow observation of histologic features, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by transcardial perfusion with 10 ml of PBS, followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The brains were removed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4°C, and stained with hematoxylin (DaKo) and 0.25% eosin (Merck). For immunohistochemical staining of neural stem cell markers (Nestin, Abcam), after the antigen retrieval process with citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and endogenous peroxidase blocking with 3% hydrogen peroxide, tissue sections were incubated in 1% BSA blocking solution (vol/vol) for 0.5 h at room temperature and then in primary antibody overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber. To decrease nonspecific Nestin signals in mouse tissue, we used the Mouse on Mouse Elite Peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories) and developed samples using 3,3ʹ-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories) as chromogen. For immunocytochemistry, GSCs were seeded in bovine fibronectin (10 μg/ml in PBS) coated chamber slide with the complete medium of GSCs. After 24 h of incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4°C and washed three times with PBS at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in blocking solution (5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were stained with primary antibodies in blocking solution (1:100) for 2 h at 4°C and washed three times with PBS.
