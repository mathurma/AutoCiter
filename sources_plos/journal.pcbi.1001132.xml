                <p>The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept is a highly debated topic in cancer research.
                    While experimental evidence in favor of the cancer stem cell theory is
                    apparently abundant, the results are often criticized as being difficult to
                    interpret. An important reason for this is that most experimental data that
                    support this model rely on transplantation studies. In this study we use a novel
                    cellular Potts model to elucidate the dynamics of established malignancies that
                    are driven by a small subset of CSCs. Our results demonstrate that epigenetic
                    mutations that occur during mitosis display highly altered dynamics in
                    CSC-driven malignancies compared to a classical, non-hierarchical model of
                    growth. In particular, the heterogeneity observed in CSC-driven tumors is
                    considerably higher. We speculate that this feature could be used in combination
                    with epigenetic (methylation) sequencing studies of human malignancies to prove
                    or refute the CSC hypothesis in established tumors without the need for
                    transplantation. Moreover our tumor growth simulations indicate that CSC-driven
                    tumors display evolutionary features that can be considered beneficial during
                    tumor progression. Besides an increased heterogeneity they also exhibit
                    properties that allow the escape of clones from local fitness peaks. This leads
                    to more aggressive phenotypes in the long run and makes the neoplasm more
                    adaptable to stringent selective forces such as cancer treatment. Indeed when
                    therapy is applied the clone landscape of the regrown tumor is more aggressive
                    with respect to the primary tumor, whereas the classical model demonstrated
                    similar patterns before and after therapy. Understanding these often
                    counter-intuitive fundamental properties of (non-)hierarchically organized
                    malignancies is a crucial step in validating the CSC concept as well as
                    providing insight into the therapeutical consequences of this model.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Cancer is in essence a genetic disease that leads to uncontrolled cell
                    proliferation, invasion and metastasis. The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis
                    states that tumors are not just a mass of uniform malignant cells but they are
                    hierarchically organized, like normal tissues. At the top of such a hierarchy
                    are cancer stem cells that fuel tumor growth in the long run, whereas the
                    majority of other cells are able to divide only a few times. The experiments
                    that support the CSC hypothesis are often criticized as being difficult to
                    interpret. A novel approach to test the CSC paradigm is to integrate
                    mathematical modeling with DNA variation data that carry the phylogenetic
                    history of cells. We have developed a model that simulates the occurrence of
                    such changes under both the CSC hypothesis and the classical, purely stochastic
                    scenario. We found that although a CSC-driven tumor has a smaller number of
                    tumorigenic cells, it triggers more malignant properties such as invasive
                    growth, heterogeneity and evolutionary escape from peaks in the fitness
                    landscape. These properties, that are unique to the CSC model, are enhanced even
                    further when a treatment is applied to the tumor.</p>

            <p>Tumor formation and progression are highly dynamic processes that are driven by the
                accumulation of genetic lesions that facilitate the ability of cancer cells to
                invade surrounding tissue, form metastases and develop resistance to therapy. As
                suggested by Nowell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Nowell1">[1]</xref>, cancer progression is driven by selective pressure on the
                cancer cell population as a result of the competition for space and resources among
                different malignant cells as well as normal cells. Recent observations complicate
                this attractive model by suggesting that besides clonal (genetic) variations between
                cancer cells, the differentiation grade of cells also contributes to the
                heterogeneity found in tumors of various kinds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Reya1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Vermeulen1">[3]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Experiments demonstrating that only a small fraction of cancer cells are capable of
                transplanting the disease in immuno-compromised mice led to the speculation that
                tumors are hierarchically organized tissues that depend on so-called cancer stem
                cells (CSCs) for their long-term growth. This assumption is supported by the finding
                that tumor initiating cell populations can be isolated based on expression of
                markers that are often associated with immature cell types in a variety of tissues.
                For example only the CD133<sup>+</sup> fraction of glioblastoma cells, which
                make up approximately 1% of the total tumor cell load, is capable of
                initiating growth of a new glioblastoma upon transplantation. Injection of as many
                as 100,000 CD133<sup>+</sup> cells does not result in effective tumor formation
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Singh1">[4]</xref>. To date,
                the evidence for the CSC model of malignancies is entirely based on transplantation
                assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Kern1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Tomasson1">[6]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Problems with interpretation of the transplantation data include potential
                xenotransplantation bias (injection of human cells into mice), remaining
                immunological effects in the recipient mice, and the fact that for isolation of the
                various cell populations all the tumor tissue is disrupted. Moreover the fact that
                the main tumor mass is not capable of initiating a new tumor does not necessarily
                imply that these cells are also incapable of participating in the growth of an
                established malignancy. Indeed it is found that various mouse models of
                hematological malignancies do not display a rare CSC compartment when the cells are
                injected in autologous mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Kelly1">[7]</xref>. Moreover it appears that the type of immuno-compromised
                mouse strain used for the transplantation assay greatly influences the fraction of
                cells capable of inducing tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Quintana1">[8]</xref>. This has led numerous
                researchers to warn against overly optimistic interpretations of these data, and has
                resulted in intense debate in the oncology field over the validity of the CSC
                concept <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Kern1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Hill1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Adams1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Shackleton1">[11]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Previously, we and others have demonstrated how the analysis of methylation patterns
                in regions of the genome rich in CpG dinucleotides (a molecular pattern that can be
                methylated), collected from different parts of a tumor, can be a valuable tool in
                deciphering the phylogenetic history of malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Siegmund1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Woo1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Siegmund2">[14]</xref>. The advantage of methylation
                is the higher mutation rate of ∼2×10<sup>−5</sup> per site per
                division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Yatabe1">[15]</xref>
                compared to DNA point mutations, such as microsatellites
                    (∼10<sup>−10</sup>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Kunkel1">[16]</xref>). This makes
                methylation changes occurring in neutral CpG-rich genomic regions a powerful and
                more precise molecular clock that acts as a cell division counter and allows for the
                inference of cell phylogeny within established malignancies. The neutrality of these
                mutations, i.e. the fact that these loci are replicated but not transcribed and
                expressed, is important because selective forces may disrupt the relationship
                between the number of errors and of cell divisions. Being suitable markers to trace
                cell fate in tumors, in this study we model the occurrence of neutral methylation
                mutations in respect of pattern heterogeneity and distribution with the aim of
                comparing the dynamics of a CSC-driven malignancy to a purely stochastic,
                non-hierarchical model of tumor growth that we refer to as the <italic>classical
                    model</italic>.</p>
            <p>In addition to concerns related to the experimental procedures that support the CSC
                theory there are also important theoretical arguments that challenge the CSC
                concept. Classical organized clones, in which all cells are clonogenic, are
                predicted quickly to outgrow the hierarchical clones due to favorable growth
                kinetics. Therefore, one would expect that evolutionary forces rapidly select for
                non-hierarchical cancer cell populations that outcompete the stem cell driven clones
                that have retained this organization from the tissue in which they arose. However,
                potentially CSC-driven tumor cell clones display non-intuitive features that are
                useful in the process of tumor formation and perhaps even in therapy resistance. To
                investigate the different evolutionary dynamics of the two models and to explore the
                potential evolutionary benefits of a hierarchical organization of cancer cells, we
                expand the computational model and introduce non-neutral mutations that can confer a
                different fitness on cells. In this setting we analyze the behavior of the different
                models under different fitness conditions and landscapes. To conclude, we also study
                the effect of therapy on CSC-driven tumors.</p>

            <p>We developed a model of tumor growth based on a cellular Potts approach that can
                simulate cancer cell proliferation in a realistic fashion. Our model incorporates
                the fundamental processes occurring in cancer growth, such as cell division and
                apoptosis. Cellular Potts models have the important benefit of being able to
                simulate complex cellular mechanisms such as cell division, apoptosis and cellular
                rearrangements realistically and very efficiently, without the need of artificial
                assumptions on cellular mechanics. On top of this we model the occurrence of neutral
                methylation mutations and the existence of a hierarchical organization in the
                malignant clone, composed of cancer stem cells (CSC), transient amplifying cells
                (TAC) and terminally differentiated cells (DC) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
            <p>To study the dynamics of neutral epigenetic mutations as markers of cell populations
                in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Shibata1">[17]</xref> we
                model neutral methylation changes by assuming that at each cell division errors in
                copying a 64-CpG dinucleotide region can occur in both the mother and the daughter
                cell. We assume methylation and demethylation rates of
                    µ = 2×10<sup>−5</sup> errors per CpG site
                per cell division occurring in all cells, regardless of their proliferative
                potential or their stemness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Yatabe1">[15]</xref>. To simulate hierarchical tumor organization we assume
                that CSCs in the system are able to self-renew with probability ψ or to divide
                asymmetrically with probability 1-ψ. In the first case the result of the cell
                division are two CSCs, in the second the original CSC and a TAC, able to divide only
                    <italic>G</italic> times before becoming quiescent. Due to the absence of
                homeostasis in the tumor we assume that symmetrical division yielding two transient
                amplifying cells (CSC differentiation) does not occur. With this scheme classical
                clonal tumor growth in which all cells are tumorigenic is simulated by setting

                <title>Neutral epigenetic mutations</title>
                <p>We used our cellular Potts model to investigate levels and distribution patterns
                    of epigenetically distinct clones in both CSC-driven malignancies as well as in
                    non-hierarchical organized tumors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s008">Video S1</xref> display the simulated growth of a
                    classical malignancy with ψ = 1 whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s009">Video S2</xref>
                    shows a CSC malignancy with ψ = 0.1. The total tumor
                    volume in both experiments is 100,000 cells. While the classical model exhibits
                    a spherical morphology, a CSC-driven neoplasm is characterized by irregular
                    tumor borders and invasive patterns driven by expansion of CSCs, as already
                    reported in previous studies by us <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva1">[18]</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Enderling1">[19]</xref>. With
                    respect to the methylation patterns the two models also behave in a radically
                    different way. The CSC model shows a patch-like distribution that originates
                    from single founder CSCs while the clones in the classical model tend to follow
                    a radial expansion pattern, as can be appreciated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g001">Figure 1C</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s010">Video S3</xref>)
                    and 1D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s011">Video
                        S4</xref>) in which epigenetically distinct clones are indicated by
                    different colors. The CSC model is also characterized by slower tumor growth and
                    less cell divisions per unit time due to the smaller population of long-term
                    dividing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). The difference in population size between the
                    two models can be summarized by the CSC fraction present in the clone defined as
                    the ratio between the number of CSCs and the total volume at each point in time.
                    In the classical model this value is always 1 whereas in the CSC model it can be
                    variable; in our analysis it quickly stabilizes to ∼0.2% for
                    ψ = 0.1 and
                    <italic>G</italic> = 5, this value is in line with

                <p>Next we determined the overall heterogeneity of the two different tumor growth
                    models by calculating the Shannon index. The Shannon index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Shannon1">[20]</xref> is the most frequently
                    applied measure of heterogeneity in biodiversity studies used to describe a
                    population consisting of individuals of genotypically different subpopulations.
                    This measure is based on information theory and possesses properties that
                    account for species richness within an environment. In our case we measure the
                    Shannon index of the cancer cell population and normalize it to the interval
                    [0,1] where 0 indicates a homogeneous population with only one clone
                    and 1 a fully heterogeneous population where all the subclones are equally
                    present (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This
                    measure indicates that the CSC malignancy develops a much higher epigenetic
                    heterogeneity both in the total population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and in the CSC compartment alone
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), compared to
                    the classical model (n = 16,
                        p = 10<sup>−7</sup> for 100,000 cells). The CSC
                    model reaches levels of heterogeneity that are 25% of the maximum
                    possible heterogeneity. These differences can also be appreciated when the
                    non-normalized Shannon index is considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s002">Figure S2A and
                        S2B</xref>). The high standard deviations reported in these plots also
                    suggest that a high level of stochasticity is exhibited by growth driven by a
                    small number of CSCs. As we will discuss further, this feature of CSC driven
                    tumor growth has critical consequences in the evolutionary dynamics of
                    malignancies when non-neutral mutations are considered.</p>

                            a = 0.01). Importantly this measure is even
                            enhanced when considering the CSC compartment only (<bold>B</bold>)
                                (p = 10<sup>−7</sup> at 100,000 cells).

                </fig>
                <p>The enhanced heterogeneity is especially striking since within the CSC model the
                    effective population size, i.e. the number of cells contributing to tumor growth
                    in the long run (the CSCs), is about 500 times smaller than in the
                    non-hierarchical model. Moreover we assumed the mutation rate for an individual
                    cell is equal in both models. We confirmed that these results are not dependent
                    on the particular set of parameters we applied, as we observe a similar outcome
                    for different values of the number, <italic>G</italic>, of transient amplifying
                    stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s003">Figure
                        S3A</xref>). Moreover, different apoptosis rates for both the classical and
                    the CSC model, or varying the mutation rate does not change our overall
                    conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s003">Figure S3B, S3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s004">S4</xref>). Interestingly, the parameter
                        <italic>G</italic> has a non-trivial effect on the hierarchical model: high
                    values of <italic>G</italic> correspond to long-living TACs that add
                    proliferative potential to the clone. On the other hand small values of
                        <italic>G</italic> may also increase the CSC ratio due to the small number
                    of cells produced by TACs. In addition, a higher apoptosis rate induces higher
                    heterogeneity by stimulating more cell divisions in both models; however
                    difference was significant only for the CSC model
                    (p = 0.01).</p>
                <p>We propose that the increased heterogeneity in the CSC model is due to the
                    fundamental intrinsic property of hierarchical growth models that are driven by
                    long-lived CSCs that must undergo a large number of cell divisions to keep
                    fueling the growing cancer population and thereby acquire more (epi)genetic
                    hits. On top of this mechanism, the probability that a specific clone takes over
                    a subregion of the tumor of size <italic>N</italic> purely by drift, i.e. in a
                    scenario of neutral mutations, is ∼<italic>1/N</italic> whereas for the CSC

                    potential of TACs. Hence, under equal environmental conditions and mutation
                    rate, a CSC-driven tumor can achieve higher epigenetic heterogeneity solely due
                    to its hierarchical organization. This is despite the smaller effective
                    population size of a CSC-driven malignancy. This feature, as well as the
                    distribution of methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>) could potentially be used
                    as a signature of a CSC-driven malignancy in established human tumors.</p>

                <title>Non-neutral mutations over a fitness landscape</title>
                <p>So far we have shown how hierarchical organization of malignant cells has a major
                    effect on the heterogeneity and spatial distribution of neutral methylation
                    patterns. To study the difference between the two models in term of evolutionary
                    dynamics, we now consider non-neutral epigenetic mutations that confer changes
                    in terms of cell fitness.</p>
                <p>Because of the complex interaction between genetic loci, mutations can be
                    mutually deleterious yet confer a fitness advantage when they occur together
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Weissman1">[21]</xref>.
                    Other mutations appear to be mutually exclusive, suggesting that co-occurrence
                    of these genetic alterations confers a fitness disadvantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sensi1">[22]</xref>. The fitness
                    landscape is defined as a map between the space of possible mutations and the
                    fitness advantage conferred by the phenotypes to which they relate. The fitness
                    landscape involved in initiation and progression of malignancies is believed to
                    be a complex curve, with valleys, peaks and local minima and maxima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Weissman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Weinreich1">[23]</xref>. To
                    represent the effects of different fitness landscapes on a growing cancer we
                    assume that as the population of cancer cells introduces new mutations, the
                    fitness of individuals moves across a certain fitness landscape function
                        <italic>f(x)</italic>. We approximate the evolutionary process by assuming
                    that changes in fitness can occur only by mutations that cause local movements
                    within the fitness function, such as <italic>x</italic> →
                        <italic>x+1</italic> or <italic>x</italic> →
                        <italic>x−1</italic>.</p>
                <p>We summarize the complex mechanisms behind the accumulation of epigenetic
                    mutations into a non-neutral mutation rate parameter
                    µ<sub>f</sub> = 0.1 per cell division that induces
                    changes in the cell phenotype <italic>x</italic>, that in turn corresponds to a
                    division rate <italic>f(x)</italic>. In this scenario clones with different
                    replication times compete with each other for space. A further selective force
                    is represented in our model by apoptosis, occurring at a constant rate that
                    affects relatively slowly dividing clones more dramatically. To illustrate this,
                    we assume a space of 50 phenotypes with <italic>x</italic> ∈
                    [−24,+25] with solid boundary conditions (no mutation can
                    occur beyond the borders) on which we define different fitness landscapes, both
                    linear and non-linear as well as symmetric and asymmetric, and we compare the
                    behavior of the two models of growth under such fitness conditions. We start all
                    the simulations with a single cell possessing the phenotype
                            <italic>x<sub>0</sub> = 0</italic> that can
                    randomly move right or left along the x-axis. We simulate growth of the neoplasm
                    until a volume of 100,000 cells is reached (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001132-t001">Table 1</xref> for the other parameters used).</p>
                <p>In the simplest case we define a linear fitness curve
                        <italic>f<sub>L</sub>(x) = x+8</italic> (with
                            <italic>f<sub>L</sub>(x) = 1</italic> for negative
                    values of <italic>x</italic>) in which the replication rate increases
                    proportionally to <italic>x</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g003">Figure 3A</xref>,
                        <italic>n = 8</italic>). As expected, in both models
                    the bulk of the population tends towards clones expressing higher fitness (high
                    values of <italic>x</italic>). Importantly, it is apparent how the CSC model
                    shows the property of spreading much faster across the fitness landscape
                    compared to the classical model. The CSC model mainly explores higher fitness
                    regions, yet also phenotypes with relatively low fitness values are abundantly
                    present. This is in line with our previous finding that the CSC model stimulates
                    heterogeneity and we argue that this effect has to do with the lower selective
                    pressure present in the CSC model that allows clones with no direct survival
                    benefit to coexist in the neoplasm and contribute to tumor growth. Furthermore,
                    this peculiar property has consequences in the evolutionary process because it
                    allows populations to visit, and eventually cross, regions of the landscape with
                    lower fitness values that nevertheless may lead to beneficial phenotypes in the
                    long run (fitness valleys).</p>

                            differences are present under an asymmetrical fitness function

                <p>To evaluate the response of the models to more complex fitness variations we
                    defined a sinusoidal function
                        <italic>f<sub>S</sub>(x) = 3−x sin(x/2)</italic>
                    (with <italic>f<sub>S</sub>(x) = 1</italic> for negative
                    values). This function is characterized by fitness valleys that lead to peaks
                    with faster replicating phenotypes in the long run. An example of a fitness
                    valley is the cooperation of the oncogenes Myc and RAS in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Trumpp1">[24]</xref>. Whereas
                    these oncogenes promote tumorigenesis when both are mutated, the mutation of
                    only one of them has an anti-cancer effect due to the induction of apoptosis in
                    Myc-mutated cells and senescence in RAS-mutated ones. From these types of study
                    it is concluded that the crossing of fitness valleys is therefore an important
                    mechanism that occurs during tumorigenesis and tumor progression. To simulate
                    this property we apply a sinusoidal fitness function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g003">Figure 3B</xref>,
                        <italic>n = 8</italic>). Here we observe how the
                    evolutionary properties of the classical model prevent clones from overcoming
                    local minima due to the stringent action of phenotypical selection. The cancer
                    cell population can evolve only within the restricted central part of the
                    fitness landscape that represents the local optimum. Strikingly, because of the
                    weaker effect of selection and the more important role of drift, the CSC
                    population can expand to a broader part of the fitness curve and acquire more
                    aggressive phenotypes in the long term. A very similar pattern is illustrated in
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g003">Figure 3C</xref> where the
                    fitness peaks are more numerous due to a slightly different fitness function
                            <italic>f'<sub>S</sub>(x) = x
                        sin(x)+2</italic>. Here again the classical model adapts to the local
                    fitness landscape whereas the CSC model can escape it and reach further
                    evolutionary peaks. This dynamical evolutionary mechanism, driven not only by
                    selection but also by drift, is even more evident when we analyze different
                    growth stages of the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g003">Figure 3C</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s005">Figure S5</xref>).
                    This highlights how the distribution of the clones dynamically
                        <italic>probes</italic> the fitness landscape and ultimately reaches higher
                    fitness points.</p>
                <p>To perturb the symmetrical effects of random mutations we define a third function
                    with asymmetric properties to further analyze the response of the models. The
                    fitness landscape <italic>f<sub>C</sub>(x)  = x
                        cos(x/2)+2</italic> specifies a similar function to the previous one
                    but it has asymmetrical properties with respect to the y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Once more the
                    results suggest a conservative behavior of the classical model that quickly
                    adapts to the local maximum and, in contrast, a highly dynamical behavior of the
                    CSC model that instead overcomes fitness valleys during a fast exploration of
                    the fitness landscape.</p>
                <p>To eliminate the bias introduced by an expanding population we investigate the
                    stationary distribution of the phenotypes in a non-expanding malignancy. For
                    this we run a set of simulations with the sinusoidal fitness function
                            <italic>f<sub>S</sub>(x)</italic> in which we start with a volume of
                    25,000 cells and maintain constant population size by randomly killing cells to
                    maintain the original volume, until a total of 1.2 million cell divisions is
                    reached in both models of tumor growth. This approach shows that the findings we
                    described for expanding malignancies are confirmed for a stationary scenario
                    with constant population size and an equally large number of cell divisions in
                    both models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
                <p>Clearly, in both models the clone distribution does not simply scatter through
                    dispersion but is driven by the fitness function that offers local peaks near
                    the starting point with relatively easy access and other higher peaks that are
                    preceded by low fitness values. While the classical model remains trapped within
                    those initial local maxima, the CSC model is free to move ahead to higher
                    fitness peaks, showing its ability to overcome fitness valleys. In all our
                    results, the classical model emerges as a model of growth primarily driven by
                    selection for the (non-optimal) fittest clones that outcompete the large number
                    of tumorigenic cells in their neighborhood. In this type of scenario overcoming
                    local maxima and exploring large portions of the fitness landscape becomes
                    impossible. Within high selective pressure conditions, any cell that acquires
                    even a slightly lower fitness (approaching a fitness valley) due to a
                    disadvantageous mutation would be immediately out-competed by the surrounding
                    cells with higher fitness. The higher robustness of the CSC model, induced by
                    its lower selective pressure that allows for the proliferation of several clones
                    with no selective advantage, increases the adaptability of the cancer population
                    that also becomes more evolvable. The lower selective pressure allows cells to
                    approach a fitness valley and bear <italic>temporarily</italic> disadvantageous
                    mutations such as RAS with wildtype Myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Trumpp1">[24]</xref> to survive in a sort of
                    spatial evolutionary niche. Such cells could then carry on accumulating
                    aberrations, such as Myc in this example, and become more malignant in the long
                    run. This direct but counterintuitive relationship between robustness and
                    evolvability has recently been discussed by Draghi and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Draghi1">[25]</xref>. In a
                    CSC-driven malignancy such robustness is not assumed <italic>a priori</italic>,
                    depending on a specific fitness landscape, but emerges naturally from the
                    hierarchical organization itself. These results show how a hierarchically
                    organized populations of cancer cells, despite having the disadvantage of a
                    smaller effective cell population size, can escape stringent selective forces
                    represented by cancer therapies that target fast dividing cells. Such treatment
                    modalities would be highly effective in a selection-driven classical model of
                    growth. This therapy-escaping mechanism present in hierarchical malignancies may
                    lead to a more invasive and therapy-resistant cancer through faster accumulation
                    of diverse clones and evolutionary escape of local fitness peaks.</p>

                <title>Evolutionary dynamics associated with treatment</title>
                <p>To investigate the influence of therapy in the different cancer scenarios we
                    simulate the application of treatment when the tumor volume reaches 30,000
                    cells. At that point in time, all proliferating cells (see Material and Methods)
                    are killed, independently of their differentiation status. The remaining cells
                    are left to repopulate the tumor and form the relapse. We analyze the status of
                    the tumor just before therapy and after the relapsed neoplasm has again reached
                    the volume of 30,000 cells. As an example we consider the sinusoidal fitness
                    function <italic>f<sub>S</sub>(x)</italic> with the same conditions as employed
                    before. Whereas the classical model displays no evident difference between the
                    two time points (the neoplasm has just regrown similarly to its primary
                    counterpart), in the CSC model the therapy has radically altered the
                    distribution of the phenotypes, pushing larger populations of cells to occupy
                    higher fitness peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g004">Figure 4A and
                        4B</xref>). The phenotypical heterogeneity of the clones does not
                    significantly change in the CSC model (p = 0.46) while it
                    decreases slightly in the classical model (p = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s007">Figure
                    S7A</xref>). However, the average fitness does increase considerably in the CSC
                    model (p = 0.0023) and yet only minimally in the classical
                    model (p = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). According to this analysis the
                    CSC model not only relapses more aggressively, but it also changes the
                    phenotypical composition of its clones, resulting in a relapsed neoplasm that is
                    radically different from the originally treated one. In the classical model most
                    of the cells stay within the local fitness peak seeking the highest local
                    fitness point. Cells that eventually survive therapy are still trapped within
                    the same peaks and the tumor that develops after relapse is very similar to the
                    primary one. Said differently, the CSC model also allows less fit clones to
                    survive in the lower parts of the fitness landscape. In this way cells are not
                    only prone to cross fitness valleys, but in case of treatment, they can survive
                    due to their slow cycling phenotype. Hence, the relapsed tumor benefits from the
                    further expansion of the clone pool towards even more aggressive phenotypes.
                    This mechanism results not only in the increase of aggressiveness of the
                    neoplasm at time of relapse, but also in a very different clonal composition of
                    the tumor. The behavior of the CSC model therefore suggests that the fundamental
                    organization of malignant clones may directly influence the therapeutic effect
                    of treatment and the acquisition of resistance in cancers.</p>

            <p>Modeling tumor growth using cellular automata, partial differential equations and
                hybrid models has revealed some of the important underlying dynamics of the growth
                of malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Roose1">[26]</xref>. Since the models proposed by Dormann and Deutsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Dormann1">[27]</xref> it has been
                possible to simulate the formation of a three-layered structure in tumors, made by
                proliferating, quiescent and necrotic layers. Successively, more advanced hybrid
                models have shown how the invasion patterns in malignancies could arise from the
                interaction with the microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Anderson1">[28]</xref>. A similar hybrid approach,
                incorporating the CSC concept, has illustrated how a small population of stem-like
                cells in cancer can drive tumor invasion with a mechanism that the authors define as
                self-metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Enderling1">[19]</xref>. Using a cellular automata approach we have previously
                shown that tissue invasion and intra-tumor heterogeneity could arise from the
                internal organization of the clone itself, from its interaction with the
                microenvironment or from a complex mixture of both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva2">[29]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Recently, cellular automata based on Potts models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Wu1">[30]</xref> have been developed to simulate the
                dynamics of populations of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Tripodi1">[31]</xref>. Models derived from this paradigm have been successfully
                employed in cancer research to predict the conditions for cancer cell survival and
                the diffusion dynamics of growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Jiang1">[32]</xref>. In this work we use a similar
                approach to model the cellular growth of malignancies but for the first time to our
                knowledge, we integrate the cellular Potts modeling approach with the hierarchical
                organization of cancer cell populations and with the occurrence of neutral and
                non-neutral mutations to study the evolutionary dynamics of malignancies. We put
                special emphasis on the process of cancer evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Merlo1">[33]</xref> since this covers the most
                fundamental questions in cancer research such as the progression of tumors to
                invasive and metastatic neoplasms.</p>
            <p>In evolutionary terms, cancer cells compete for resources such as oxygen, glucose and
                space, both with other cancer clones as well as with normal cells surrounding the
                malignancy. The limit of available resources, such as the space to proliferate,
                induces a selective pressure on the expanding neoplasm. Each cancer cell competes
                for proliferation within those limits, a mechanism summarized in our model with the
                space constraint and random apoptosis. In this context, malignant cells with higher
                fitness can outcompete their neighbors in terms of proliferation and so lead to
                clone expansion. Hence, a fully clonogenic tumor, i.e. a tumor in which all cells
                posses the capacity to proliferate indefinitely, appears to be the best organization
                to develop further malignant traits and clonal heterogeneity, as observed in tumors
                    <italic>in vivo</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Aubele1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Navin1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Park1">[36]</xref>.</p>
            <p>However, our investigations suggest that under the same environmental conditions and
                mutation rate, the evolutionary dynamics of neutral epigenetic changes in tumors
                lead to the counter-intuitive emergence of intra-tumor heterogeneity in
                hierarchically organized malignancies. This process seems to be intrinsic to the
                organization present in the malignant clone itself and need not depend upon external
                microenvironmental factors. Certainly, the tumor microenvironment has been shown to
                play an important role in cancer, in particular in modulating stem cell features of
                cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Calabrese1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Vermeulen2">[38]</xref>. Although we do not take this into consideration in the
                present study, previous results suggest that a model where the stemness is intrinsic
                to the cell and a model where instead it is completely determined by the
                microenvironment yield similar results regarding the clonal evolution of the
                malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva2">[29]</xref>. In our future studies we plan to incorporate this aspect of
                tumor biology in more detail; in fact our cellular Potts model approach is a natural
                framework to study this type of interaction.</p>
            <p>The CSC compartment may be fixed or display plasticity driven by the
                microenvironment; in both cases a tumor organization that stimulates heterogeneity
                through genetic drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Merlo1">[33]</xref> and promotes the emergence of clones without a direct
                survival benefit may allow a more malignant evolution of a cancer cell population
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Maley1">[39]</xref>.
                Furthermore, we have shown how in the CSC model cancer cells are free to explore the
                landscape of possible genetic alterations, overcome fitness valleys (local minima)
                and escape from local fitness peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001132-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001132.s006">S6</xref>), as also observed in the evolution of small
                populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Gokhale1">[40]</xref>
                and in the adaptability of robust phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Draghi1">[25]</xref>. We believe that such growth
                could give rise to radically different evolutionary dynamics, unlike the scenario
                where only the fittest individuals overcome the competitors. Instead, we propose
                that populations of cancer cells can raise their survival chances not only through
                their relative fitness, but also by increasing genetic drift through a mechanism of
                segregation. In this way, individuals could achieve survival because of the lowered
                selective pressure and increased genetic drift, rather than through stringent
                competition. This last mechanism can occur by means of migration but also through
                hierarchical organization of clones that consequently would occur in segregation of
                individuals through asymmetric division of stem-like cells.</p>
            <p>In a highly competitive environment with scarce resources such as in a tumor
                microenvironment, being fitter (e.g. proliferating faster) may be too expensive
                and/or disadvantageous in the long run since it diminishes the heterogeneity of the
                total population, as we demonstrated in this study. Alternatively, a clone could
                evolve through an easier yet riskier path, such as due to lower selective pressure
                and increased genetic drift induced by any mechanism of segregation. This suggests
                an intimate relationship between evolution and organization of a malignant clone:
                the hierarchical structure of growth could be advantageous in evolutionary terms
                with respect to a flat structure, despite its apparently limited proliferative
                potential. Generally, this process could occur in other types of evolving
                populations. These findings directly support the need for using spatial models in
                the study of evolutionary dynamics of tumor growth.</p>
            <p>On top of these mechanisms, a hierarchically organized cancer population has the
                capacity to regenerate after treatment, presenting a relapsed neoplasm that displays
                more aggressive traits and a substantially different clonal composition compared to
                its primary counterpart. This is especially intriguing as relapsed tumors are often
                considerably different from the original malignancy in many features including
                aggressiveness and clonal composition. This fact is usually attributed to the
                selection of clones that are relatively resistant to particular drugs during
                treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Huff1">[41]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-SpieglKreinecker1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-ElSharouni1">[43]</xref>. However, our findings indicate that a CSC-driven
                malignancy has intrinsic features that explain such behavior independently of clonal
                resistance.</p>
            <p>In conclusion this work presents a theoretical study of the emerging properties of
                CSC-driven tumor growth. It clearly points out interesting and counterintuitive
                features of hierarchically organized models of growth. To corroborate our findings
                by means of experimentation, a possible approach would be to employ extensive
                methylation sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Yatabe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Shibata1">[17]</xref> of <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>
                tumors known to retain a CSC organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Lee1">[44]</xref>. Our predictions could help to
                establish if rare CSCs are effectively present in tumors, as advocated by the CSC
                hypothesis. More importantly, our results refer directly to an <italic>in
                    vivo</italic> context that can be accessed in terms of methylation analysis, a
                scenario that transplantation and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments are unable
                to reproduce convincingly. Finally, our study elucidates evolutionary mechanisms
                that have critical implications for therapy resistance of tumors such as the
                increased heterogeneity, the escape from local fitness peaks and the capacity to
                present a completely altered malignancy after treatment.</p>

                <title>The tumor growth model</title>
                <p>To simulate a malignancy and the mutations occurring in it we developed a
                    mathematical model of tumor growth based on a <italic>Cellular Potts
                        Model</italic> (CPM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Wu1">[30]</xref>. A CPM is a Monte Carlo computational modeling
                    technique developed in the field of statistical mechanics. Our model allows us
                    to simulate several important processes occurring in the growth of a tumor such
                    as cell proliferation, cell membrane deformation and cell-to-cell adhesion. A
                    CPM represents the system, in our case the tumour, as a 2-dimensional lattice
                    Ω with N×N sites. Each cell has a unique identifier σ that
                    defines the cell volume V<sub>σ</sub> and shape within the lattice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Glazier1">[45]</xref>. To each
                    cell identifier is also assigned a cell type τ(σ), in our case for
                    instance a cancer stem cell or a differentiated cancer cell. In a CPM we can
                    simulate cell proliferation and adhesion by representing these processes as
                    transitions from energetically unfavorable states to energetically favorable
                    ones. In this manner, for example, a compressed cell would seek to maintain its
                    volume by creating a counterforce. The total energy of the system can be
                    described by a simple Hamiltonian: <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001132.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>with E<sub>v</sub> the cell elastic energy

                <p>This technique allows us to simulate efficiently and in an elegant way several
                    crucial processes occurring in cancer. Our model proved to be very flexible and
                    computationally fast and therefore suitable to perform statistical inference of
                    biological parameters, as in the case of the colon crypt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva3">[47]</xref>. Here we propose an
                    extension of such a model to simulate large cancer cell populations within a
                    malignancy. The model simulates the expansion of malignant cells that originate
                    from a single initial cancer cell that can proliferate by invading the
                    surrounding tissue (not simulated) while accumulating DNA mutations according to
                    any mutation scheme we need. Because cancers are accompanied by massive cell
                    death we introduce in our model an apoptosis rate <italic>a</italic> that
                    corresponds to the fraction of cells randomly selected for death every 24 h.
                    This parameter allows us to investigate the influence of apoptosis in the
                    dynamics of cancer epigenetic alterations in cancer.</p>
                <p>On top of this tumor growth model, we implemented the CSC hierarchy by assuming
                    two possible cell types in the system: cancer stem cells (CSC) and more
                    differentiated cancer cells (DCC). At every division a CSC has probability δ
                    to self-renew and therefore generate a new CSC, and probability 1-ψ to spin
                    off a TAC. TACs can undergo a maximum of <italic>G</italic> divisions before
                    becoming fully differentiated and irreversibly stopping division. By changing
                    the parameter ψ we can modify the size of the CSC compartment, spanning
                    tumors with a very small population of CSCs (ψ&lt;1) to the classical model
                    of malignancies where all cells in the tumor are tumorigenic and have stem-like
                    features (ψ = 1). In this model no active cell
                    migration is considered, however cells may diffuse due to low cell-to-cell
                    adhesion and the distribution of mechanical forces within the tumor.</p>
                <p>To implement cell fitness advantage, in relationship to a certain fitness
                    landscape, we assign to each cell a specific phenotype in the range
                    [−25,25] with the first cell starting with phenotype 0. To each
                    phenotype <italic>x</italic> corresponds a fitness value <italic>f(x)</italic>,
                    representing the growth rate of the cells possessing that phenotype. In the
                    model this corresponds to the increase of target volume <italic>δV</italic>
                    implemented in the step 7 illustrated above. In this way cells with a faster
                    growing phenotype will reach the target volume faster and will consequently
                    divide more often.</p>
                <p>Although we have also developed a 3-dimensional version of the model, in this
                    paper we make use of a 2-dimensional implementation of it. This represents a
                    tumor as a sheet of cells and permits us to study the global evolutionary
                    dynamics of a considerably larger cancer cell population by enhancing the
                    computational feasibility. We believe that to investigate the dynamics we
                    discuss, a two-dimensional model is a good and efficient solution, as for most
                    tumor growth models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Jiang1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Anderson2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Anderson3">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Bearer1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Macklin1">[51]</xref>. Moreover, agent-based models of tumor growth like
                    the one we describe have proved to yield equivalent results in both two and
                    three dimensions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Sottoriva1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Anderson1">[28]</xref>. In general, simulation times on a 2.5 GHz Xeon CPU
                    were of ∼8 h for the classical model experiments and ∼20 h for the CSC
                    model simulations assuming Ω = 2000×2000 with 16
                    points per cell.</p>

                <title>Measure of heterogeneity</title>
                <p>To measure the level of clonal diversity in the tumor population we make use of
                    the Shannon index of biodiversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001132-Shannon1">[20]</xref> normalized to the interval
                    [0,1]. The Shannon index is a measure of biodiversity of species
                    within an ecosystem, in our case different methylation patterns within the
                    tumor. A high value of the Shannon index indicates that all the species present
                    in the ecosystem (the different methylation patterns in the malignancy) are
                    present in equal numbers, a small Shannon index instead represents a scenario
                    where one or few patterns are present in large numbers and virtually dominate
                    the other patterns.</p>
                <p>The Shannon index <italic>H</italic> is calculated as in equation
                            (4),<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001132.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>
                    is the relative abundance of species <italic>i</italic> (a specific methylation
                    pattern). For any given number of species <italic>S</italic> there is a maximum
                    possible Shannon index of Ξ<sub>max</sub> = <italic>log
                        S</italic> that reflects the highest possible biodiversity in the system
                    where all species are present in equal number. In our analysis we consider the
                    normalized Shannon index
                        Ξ' = Ξ/Ξ<sub>max</sub> at any given
                    point in time. According to this measure a value of 0 corresponds to the
                    presence of a single dominant clone whereas a value of 1 represents a
                    heterogeneous neoplasm where all the subclones are present in equal numbers.</p>
