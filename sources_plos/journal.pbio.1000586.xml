</abstract><abstract>
<p>An ideal model system to study antiviral immunity and host-pathogen co-evolution would combine a genetically tractable small animal with a virus capable of naturally infecting the host organism. The use of <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model to define host-viral interactions has been limited by the lack of viruses known to infect nematodes. From wild isolates of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> with unusual morphological phenotypes in intestinal cells, we identified two novel RNA viruses distantly related to known nodaviruses, one infecting specifically <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Orsay virus), the other <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (Santeuil virus). Bleaching of embryos cured infected cultures demonstrating that the viruses are neither stably integrated in the host genome nor transmitted vertically. 0.2 µm filtrates of the infected cultures could infect cured animals. Infected animals continuously maintained viral infection for 6 mo (∼50 generations), demonstrating that natural cycles of horizontal virus transmission were faithfully recapitulated in laboratory culture. In addition to infecting the natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolate, Orsay virus readily infected laboratory <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants defective in RNAi and yielded higher levels of viral RNA and infection symptoms as compared to infection of the corresponding wild-type N2 strain. These results demonstrated a clear role for RNAi in the defense against this virus. Furthermore, different wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates displayed differential susceptibility to infection by Orsay virus, thereby affording genetic approaches to defining antiviral loci. This discovery establishes a bona fide viral infection system to explore the natural ecology of nematodes, host-pathogen co-evolution, the evolution of small RNA responses, and innate antiviral mechanisms.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a robust model organism that is broadly used in biology. It also has great potential for the study of host-microbe interactions, as it is possible to systematically knockout almost every gene in high-throughput fashion to examine the potential role of each gene in infection. While <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been successfully applied to the study of bacterial infections, only limited studies of antiviral responses have been possible since no virus capable of infecting any <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematode in laboratory culture has previously been described. Here we report the discovery of natural viruses infecting wild isolates of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its relative <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. These novel viruses are most closely related to the ssRNA nodaviruses, but have larger genomes than other described nodaviruses and clearly represent a new taxon of virus. We were able to use these viruses to infect a variety of laboratory nematode strains. We show that mutant worms defective in the RNA interference pathway, an antiviral system known to operate in a number of organisms, accumulate more viral RNA than wild type strains. The discovery of these viruses will enable further studies of host-virus interactions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the identification of other host mechanisms that counter viral infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Model organisms such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Hao1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Sabin1">[2]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Kim1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Powell1">[4]</xref> have been increasingly used in recent years to examine features of the host immune system and host-pathogen co-evolution mechanisms, due to the genetic tractability and ease of manipulation of these organisms. A prerequisite to fully exploit such models is the identification of an appropriate microbe capable of naturally infecting the host organism. Analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> of bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>, or <italic>Serratia</italic> has been highly fruitful, in some instances revealing the existence of innate immune pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are also conserved in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Kim1">[3]</xref>. The recent report of natural infections of <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells by microsporidia makes it a promising model for microsporidia biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Troemel1">[5]</xref>. Efforts to use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to understand anti-viral innate immunity, however, have been hampered by the lack of a natural virus competent to infect and replicate in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
<p>In the absence of a natural virus infection system, some efforts to define virus-host responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been pursued using artificial methods of introducing viruses or partial virus genomes into animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Liu1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Lu1">[7]</xref>. For example, the use of a transgenic Flock House virus RNA1 genome segment has clearly established a role for RNAi in counteracting replication of Flock House virus RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Lu1">[7]</xref> and has defined genes essential for the RNAi response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Lu2">[8]</xref>. However, this experimental system can only examine replication of the viral RNA and is fundamentally unable to address the host response to other critical aspects of the virus life cycle such as virus entry, virion assembly, or egress. The ability of a host to target steps other than genome replication to control viral infections is highlighted by recent discoveries such as the identification of tetherin, which plays a critical role at the stage of viral egress by blocking the release of fully assembled HIV virions from infected human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Neil1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, the artificial systems used to date for analysis of virus-nematode interactions cannot be used to examine transmission dynamics of virus infection. These limitations underscore the need to establish an authentic viral infection and replication system in nematodes.</p>
<p>Natural populations of <italic>C. elegans</italic> have proven hard to find until recent years. The identification of <italic>C. elegans</italic> habitats and the development of simple isolation methods (MAF, unpublished) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Barrire1">[10]</xref> has now enabled extensive collection of natural isolates of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Here we report the discovery of natural populations of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and of its close relative <italic>C. briggsae</italic> that display abnormal morphologies of intestinal cells. These abnormal phenotypes can be maintained in permanent culture for several months, without detectable microsporidial or bacterial infection. We show that these populations are infected by two distinct viruses, one specific for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Orsay virus), one for <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (Santeuil virus). These viruses resemble viruses in the <italic>Nodaviridae</italic> family, with a small, bipartite, RNA(+sense) genome. Infection by each virus is transmitted horizontally. In both nematode species, we find intraspecific variation in sensitivity to the species-specific virus. We further show that infected worms mount a small RNA response and that RNAi mechanisms act as antiviral immunity in nematodes. Finally, we demonstrate that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolate from which Orsay virus was isolated is incapable of mounting an effective RNAi response in somatic cells. We thus find natural variation in host antiviral defenses. Critically, these results establish the first experimental viral infection system in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suitable for probing all facets of the host antiviral response.</p>

<title>Natural Viral Infections of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>From surveys of wild nematodes from rotting fruit in different regions of France, multiple <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> strains were isolated that displayed a similar unusual morphology of the intestinal cells and no visible pathogen by optical microscopy. Intestinal cell structures such as storage granules disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figures 1A–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g002">2A–C</xref>) and the cytoplasm lost viscosity and became fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figure 1B,I</xref>), moving extensively during movement of the animal. The intestinal apical border showed extensive convolutions and intermediate filament disorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g002">2H</xref>, as described in some intermediate filament mutants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Hsken1">[11]</xref>). Multi-membrane structures were sometimes apparent in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Elongation of nuclei and nucleoli, and nuclear degeneration, were observed using Nomarski optics, live Hoechst 33342 staining, and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figures 1E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g002">2D–F</xref>). Finally, some intestinal cells fused together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). This suite of symptoms was first noticed during sampling of <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Indeed, more individuals appeared affected in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> than in <italic>C. elegans</italic> cultures, and to a greater extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figure 1K</xref>).</p>

<p>(A–H) <italic>C. briggsae</italic> JU1264 and (I,J) <italic>C. elegans</italic> JU1580 observed by Nomarski microscopy. (A–C, E–G, I) Infected adult hermaphrodites from the original cultures, with the diverse infection symptoms: convoluted apical intestinal border (A), degeneration of intestinal cell structures and liquefaction of the cytoplasm (B, G, I), presence of multi-membrane bodies (C). The animals in (E–H) were also observed in the fluorescence microscope after live Hoechst 33342 staining of the nuclei, showing the elongation and degeneration of nuclei (E′–H′). In (E), the nucleus and nucleolus are abnormally elongated. In (F), the nuclear membrane is no longer visible by Nomarski optics. In (G), the cell cytoplasmic structures are highly abnormal (apparent vacuolisation) and the nucleus is very reduced in size. In (E–H′), arrows denote nuclei and arrowheads nucleoli. The infected animal in (I) displays an abnormally large intestinal cell that is probably the result of cell fusions, with degeneration of cellular structures including nuclei. (D, H, J) Uninfected (bleached) adults. Arrowheads in (J) indicate antero-posterior boundaries between intestinal cells, each of which generally contains two nuclei. Bars: 10 µm. (K) Proportion of worms showing the indicated cumulative number of morphological infection symptoms in at least one intestinal cell, in the original wild isolate (I), after bleaching (bl) and after re-infection by a 0.2 µM filtrate (RI). Note that not all symptoms shown in (A–I) were scored, because some are difficult to score or may also occur in healthy animals. The animals were scored 4 d after re-infection for <italic>C. briggsae</italic> JU1264, and 7 d after re-infection for <italic>C. elegans</italic> JU1580, at 23°C. The symptoms are similar in both species, and generally more frequent in JU1264. *** <italic>p</italic> value on number of worms showing infection symptoms &lt;7.10<sup>−11</sup>, Fisher's exact test; ** <italic>p</italic> value&lt;3.10<sup>−6</sup>; * <italic>p</italic> value&lt;3.10<sup>−2</sup>.</p>

<p>(A,D,G) Bleached animals. (B–C, E–F, H) Naturally infected animals. (A–C) The infection provokes a reorganization of cytoplasmic structures, most visibly the loss of intestinal lipid storage granules (g). The cytoplasm of infected intestinal cells mostly contains rough endoplasmic reticulum (rer) and mitochondria (m). * hole in the resin used for inclusion in electron microscopy. (D–F) A nucleus in a non-infected animal is surrounded by a nuclear membrane (see inset in D), whereas the nuclear membrane disappears upon infection (E–F). Absence or incomplete nuclear membrane was observed repeatedly in infected animals, while the nuclear membrane could be observed on bleached animals (using both fixation methods). The nuclear material (n) in (F) may represent nucleolar material and at lower magnification (not shown) matches the shape of elongated nucleoli as observed by Nomarski optics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figure 1E–G</xref>). The rough endoplasmic reticulum (rer) on the left of the mitochondrion (m) in (F) may be a remnant of the nuclear envelope. (G–H) The infection may result in disorganization of the intermediate filament (IF) network normally located below the apical plasma membrane. On the right of (H) is shown a higher magnification of the intestinal lumen, showing putative viral particles (arrowheads). The animals were fixed using high-pressure freezing (A–C, E–F) or conventional fixation (D, G, H).</p>

<p>One representative, stably infected, strain of each nematode species, <italic>C. elegans</italic> JU1580 (isolated from a rotting apple in Orsay, France) and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> JU1264 (isolated from a snail on a rotting grape in Santeuil, France), were selected for detailed analysis. Bleaching of adult animals resulted in phenotype-free progeny from both strains, demonstrating that the phenotype was not vertically transmitted (embryos are resistant to the bleaching treatment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). Addition of dead infected animals, or homogenates from infected animals after filtration through 0.2 µm filters, to plates containing previously bleached animals recapitulated the morphological phenotype, raising the possibility that a virus might play a role in inducing the morphological phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g001">Figure 1K</xref>). We found that the infectious agent could be passed on horizontally through live animals by incubating GFP-labeled animals (strain JU1894, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000586-t001">Table 1</xref>) with 10 non-GFP-infected worms (JU1580), checking that the latter did not die before removing them 24 h later. The GFP-labeled culture displayed the intestinal symptoms after a week. One possibility is that the intestinal infectious agent is shed from the intestine through the rectum and may enter the next animal during feeding.</p>

<p>While a clear morphological phenotype was visible by microscopy, infection did not cause a dramatic decrease in adult longevity (unpublished data), nor a change in brood size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000586.s002">Figure S2A</xref>,B).

<title>Molecular Identification of Two Divergent Viruses</title>
<p>An unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing approach was used to determine whether any known or novel viruses were present in the animals. From JU1264, 28 unique sequence reads were identified initially that shared 30%–48% amino acid sequence identity to known viruses in the family <italic>Nodaviridae</italic>. Nodaviruses are bipartite positive strand RNA viruses. The RNA1 segment of all previously described nodaviruses is ∼3.1 kb and encodes ORF A, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Some nodaviruses also encode ORFs B1/B2 at the 3′ end of the RNA1 segment. The B1 protein is of unknown function while the B2 protein is able to inhibit RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Li1">[12]</xref>. The RNA2 segment of all previously described nodaviruses is ∼1.4 kb and possesses a single ORF encoding the viral capsid protein. Assembly of the initial JU1264 pyrosequencing reads followed by additional pyrosequencing, RT-PCR, 5′ RACE, and 3′ RACE yielded two final contigs, which were confirmed by sequencing of overlapping RT-PCR amplicons. The two contigs corresponded to the RNA1 and RNA2 segments of a novel virus. The first contig (3,628 nt) encoded a predicted open reading frame of 982 amino acids that shared 26%–27% amino acid identity to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of multiple known nodaviruses by BLAST alignment. All known nodavirus B2 proteins overlap with the C-terminus of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and are encoded in the +1 frame relative to the polymerase. No open reading frame with these properties was predicted in the 3′ end of the RNA1 segment. The second contig of 2,653 nt, which was presumed to be the near-complete RNA2 segment, encoded at its 5′ end a predicted protein with ∼30% identity to known nodavirus capsid proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This contig was ∼1 kb larger than the RNA2 segment of all previously described nodaviruses and appeared to encode a second ORF of 332 amino acids at the 3′ end. This second predicted ORF, named ORF δ, had no significant BLAST similarity to any sequence in Genbank.</p>

<p>Pyrosequencing of JU1580 demonstrated the presence of a second distinct virus that shared the same general genomic organization as the virus detected in JU1264. Partial genome sequences of 2,680 nucleotides of the RNA1 segment and 2,362 nucleotides of the RNA2 segment were obtained and confirmed by RT-PCR. The putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of the two viruses shared 44% amino acid identity by BLAST analysis. Like the virus in JU1264, the virus in JU1580 was predicted to encode a capsid protein at the 5′ end of the RNA2 segment as well as a second ORF in the 3′ half of the RNA2 segment. The ORF δ encoded proteins from the two viruses shared 37% amino acid identity when compared using BLAST. Thus, the genomic organization of these two viruses, while sharing substantial commonality with known nodaviruses, also displayed novel genomic features. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted RNA polymerase and capsid proteins demonstrated that the virus sequences in JU1580 and JU1264 were highly divergent from all previously described nodaviruses and most closely related to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>). We propose that these sequences represent two novel virus species and have tentatively named them Santeuil virus (from JU1264) and Orsay virus (from JU1580).</p>

<p>Northern blotting confirmed the presence of Orsay and Santeuil virus RNA sequences in the infected animals. Hybridization with a DNA probe targeting the RNA1 segment of Santeuil virus yielded multiple bands in JU1264 animals but not in the corresponding bleached control strain. The strongest band detected migrated between 3.5 and 4 kb consistent with the 3,628 nt sequence we generated for the putative complete RNA1 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Multiple higher molecular weight bands were also detected that may represent multimeric forms of the viral genomic RNAs, which have previously been described for some nodaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Ball1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Johnson1">[14]</xref>. Northern blotting with a probe targeting the RNA2 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) yielded a major band that migrated at ∼2.5 kb as well as fainter, higher molecular weight bands. Similar patterns were seen for both segments of Orsay virus (unpublished data).</p>
<p>To demonstrate virus replication in the infected animals, we performed Northern blotting using strand-specific riboprobes. For positive sense RNA viruses like nodaviruses, the negative sense RNA is only synthesized during active viral replication. It is not packaged in virions and typically exists in much lower quantities than the positive strand. Robust levels of the positive strand of the Santeuil virus RNA1 segment were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Northern blotting with a riboprobe designed to hybridize to the negative sense strand detected a band of ∼3.5 kb as well as higher molecular weight bands and a lower band of ∼1.5 kb (∼30-fold longer exposure than the positive sense blot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). While the precise nature of the high and low molecular weight species remains to be defined, the presence of multiple RNA species of negative sense polarity in JU1264 animals demonstrates bona fide replication of Santeuil virus in JU1264.</p>
<p>In order to determine the localization of Orsay viral RNA in infected animals, we performed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe complementary to the positive sense RNA1 segment of Orsay virus. Viral RNA was robustly detected in intestinal cells of JU1580bl animals infected 4 d previously with Orsay viral filtrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, top panels). Interestingly, some animals also showed localization of viral RNA in the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, middle panels). JU1580bl animals not treated with the viral filtrate displayed no fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, bottom panels).</p>

<title>Small RNA Response upon Infection</title>
<p>One key defense mechanism of plants and animals against RNA viruses is the small RNA response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Aliyari1">[15]</xref>. We therefore determined by deep sequencing of small RNAs whether the infected animals produced small RNAs in response to viral infection. We generated small RNA libraries from mixed-stage JU1580 animals infected with the Orsay virus and from the bleached control strain and analyzed them using Illumina/Solexa high-throughput sequencing. These libraries represent small RNAs of 18–30 nucleotides in length independent of their 5′ termini. Small RNAs from infected JU1580 animals that mapped to viral RNA1 or RNA2 and had no match to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>, respectively. Of a total of 1,149,633 unambiguously mapped unique sequences, almost 2% (21,392) mapped to the two RNA segments of Orsay virus. Such RNAs were virtually absent from a library generated from bleached JU1580 animals (&lt;0.001%) (unpublished data). Small RNAs that corresponded to the sense strand of the viral RNAs had a broad length distribution and no 5′ nucleotide preference. These sense small RNAs might represent Dicer cleavage products or other viral RNA degradation intermediates. In contrast, most antisense small RNAs were 22 nt long and showed a bias for guanidine as the first base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This signature is reminiscent of a class of secondary RNAs named 22G RNAs that are thought to be downstream effectors of exogenous and endogenous small RNA pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Gu1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Sijen1">[18]</xref>.

<title>RNAi Competency of the Host Is an Antiviral Defense</title>
<p>As viral infection appears to invoke a small RNA response in JU1580 animals, we next tested if mutations in small RNA pathways could affect replication of the Orsay virus.

<title>Natural Variation in Somatic RNAi Efficiency in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>Since a functional RNAi pathway limits the accumulation of viral RNA in the N2 reference strain, we assessed the exogenous RNAi competency of the bleached culture of JU1580 (JU1580bl) relative to the reference N2 strain. Using external application of dsRNAs by feeding, JU1580bl was found to be highly resistant to RNAi of a somatically expressed gene (<italic>unc-22</italic>) but competent for RNA inactivation of a germline-expressed gene (<italic>pos-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g008">Figure 8A,B</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild isolates, such as CB4856, were previously known to be variably sensitive to germline RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Tijsterman1">[20]</xref>. Here we thus observed for the first time a large variation in sensitivity to somatic RNAi, which does not correlate with germline RNAi sensitivity and thus cannot be due to inability to intake dsRNA from the intestinal lumen. We confirmed insensitivity to somatic RNAi of the JU1580bl isolate using a ubiquitously expressed GFP transgene (<italic>let-858::GFP</italic>), which was inactivated by GFP RNAi in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 reference background, but only modestly repressed in the JU1580bl isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000586-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000586.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

Therefore, the robust accumulation of Orsay virus RNA observed in infected JU1580 may be rendered possible in part by the partial defect in the somatic RNAi pathway of this wild isolate. The accumulation of small RNAs in response to the virus in infected JU1580 indicates, however, that its RNAi response is at least partially active in some tissues, perhaps including the germline.</p>

<p>The germline RNAi competence of JU1580 together with the presence of Orsay virus RNA1 in the somatic gonad raises the possibility that vertical transmission of viral infection could occur in a strain defective for germline RNAi.

A subset of adult animals from each plate was bleached and their adult offspring collected 4 d later.

<title>The First Viruses Infecting <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic></title>
<p>Here we report the first molecular description, to our knowledge, of viruses that naturally infect nematodes in the wild. The two novel viruses we identified, while clearly related to known nodaviruses, possess unique genomic features absent from all other previously described nodaviruses. These viruses may thus define a novel genus within the family <italic>Nodaviridae</italic> or may even represent prototype species of a new virus family (pending formal classification by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses). The same range of intestinal symptoms was observed in animals that were infected by the Orsay and Santeuil viruses, further suggesting that these viral infections were causing the cellular symptoms. We observed putative viral particles of the size expected for nodaviruses, and a strong RNA FISH signal in intestinal cells and the somatic gonad of infected animals demonstrating that the virus is present intracellularly. It is likely that further sampling of natural populations of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> will yield other viruses of this and other groups. In fact, these symptoms were seen repeatedly in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> animals sampled from different locations in France, and in one instance, a Santeuil virus variant has been identified (unpublished data).</p>
<p>A characteristic feature of these two viruses is the presence of the novel ORF δ. Conservation of sequence length and identity of the ORF δ in these two viruses, and the absence of this ORF in all other described nodaviruses, suggests that this predicted protein is likely to be important for the ability of the virus to infect or replicate in nematodes. Its function is currently unknown, but it is tempting to speculate that this protein may play a role in antagonizing an innate antiviral pathway.</p>

Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been used with great success to examine host-virus interactions for various insect viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Huszar1">[21]</xref> and influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Hao1">[1]</xref>, none of these studies has examined viral infection of the host organism by natural transmission routes. Here we present a novel association between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and a virus that persists in culture through horizontal transmission, causing high damage in intestinal cells yet remarkably little effect on the animal, which continues moving, eating, and producing progeny, although at a lower rate.</p>
<p>De novo infection of naïve animals can be affected by the simple addition of either dead infected animals or homogenized lysates made from infected animals to culture dishes. This is sufficient to seed sustained complete cycles of viral replication, shedding, and infection. With this system, it is now possible to embark on whole genome genetic screens to identify host factors that block any facet of the viral life cycle. Using the current experimental conditions, infection of JU1580bl and <italic>rde-1</italic> mutants in N2 background was highly reproducible. The fact that the reference wild type N2 strain may only sustain a very low yet detectable viral titer makes it a particularly favorable genetic background in which to screen for genes involved in interaction with the virus.</p>
<p>The intestine is a tissue that is particularly exposed to microbes through ingestion, and is a main entry point for pathogens in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as in other animals. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the intestinal cells are large and easily amenable to observations by optical microscopy. The viral parasites affect the organization of the polarized epithelial intestinal cells and will likely provide interesting mechanisms and tools to study their cell biology. Clear reorganization occurs in the intermediate filaments that line the apical brush border, as well as in the lipid storage granules, the nuclear membrane, and other intracellular compartments.</p>
<p>The abnormal state of the intestinal cells may slow down progeny production by decreasing the food intake. Alternatively, the presence of viral RNA in the somatic gonad may explain the delay in progeny production, although no gonadal cellular phenotypes have been observed. The presence of viral RNA in the somatic gonad is particularly interesting given the lack of vertical transmission.</p>

<title>Targeted Mutant Screens with Orsay Virus Confirm a Role for RNAi in Antiviral Defense</title>
<p>Although prior studies have clearly demonstrated a role for <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNAi in counteracting viral infection, these studies utilized either a transgenic system of viral RNA expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Lu1">[7]</xref> or primary culture cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Schott1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Wilkins1">[23]</xref>. The observed susceptibility of Orsay virus RNA to RNAi processing in JU1580 animals provides the first evidence in a completely natural setting, without any artificial manipulations, that RNAi serves an antiviral role in nematodes. Coupled to the increase in accumulation of Orsay virus RNA in RNAi pathway mutant strains as compared to wild type N2, these studies demonstrate that the RNAi pathway is an important antiviral defense against Orsay virus. Moreover, these results demonstrate the feasibility of identifying antiviral genes or pathways in this experimental infection system. The mechanism by which the animals prevent transmission to their offspring is unclear, but our initial results with <italic>rde-1</italic> mutants suggest that perturbing germline RNAi is not sufficient to enable vertical transmission.</p>

<title>Evolution of Viral Sensitivity and Specificity in Natural Populations</title>
<p>The quantitative difference in Orsay nodavirus sensitivity between the N2 and JU1580 wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic backgrounds will allow the identification of a set of host genes that modulate viral sensitivity during evolution of natural host populations. Based on the defect in exogenous RNAi of the JU1580 strain, we speculate that this set will include, but is unlikely to be limited to, genes involved in exogenous RNAi pathways. Support for the role of other genes outside the RNAi pathway comes from our data on natural isolates. Despite the fact that the magnitude of the somatic RNAi defect of the natural isolate PS2025 was comparable to that of JU1580, no evidence of viral RNA accumulation or morphological symptoms was observed following addition of Orsay virus filtrate. Whether PS2025 lacks one or more crucial receptors for viral infection or has alternative antiviral pathways that suppress viral replication is currently unknown.</p>
<p>In addition, the Orsay and Santeuil viruses appear to specifically infect <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, respectively. Moreover, the <italic>C. elegans rde-1</italic> mutation in the N2 background confers susceptibility to the Orsay virus, but not to the Santeuil virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000586.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). The two viruses thus provide a system to study host-parasite specificity and its evolution. With the isolation of additional variants of each virus (our unpublished data), viral evolution studies can also be undertaken. Host-parasite evolutionary and ecological interactions can thus be explored at two evolutionary scales, within and between species of both host and parasite. The rapid life cycle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> also allows experimental evolution in the laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Azevedo1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000586-Schulte1">[25]</xref>. This model system, which can include both natural and engineered variants of both virus and host, is thus favorable for combining studies of host-pathogen co-evolution in the laboratory and in natural populations.</p>

<title>Light Microscopy</title>
<p>When observed with a transillumination dissecting microscope, infected animals displayed a paler intestine than healthy worms. This lack of intestinal coloration occurred all along the entire intestinal tract in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> JU1264 and preferentially in the anterior intestinal tract in <italic>C. elegans</italic> JU1580. Intestinal cells were observed with Nomarski optics with a 63× or 100× objective. The four symptoms used for scoring were 1, the disappearance of gut granules in at least part of a cell; 2, degeneration of the nucleus including a very elongated nuclear or nucleolus (when the rest of the nucleus has degenerated) or the apparent disappearance of the nucleus; 3, the loss of cytoplasmic viscosity visible as a very fluid flow of cytosol within the cell; and 4, the fusion of intestinal cells. Some of these traits may sometimes appear in uninfected animals. We systematically tested for a significant increase after infection of the proportion of animals with symptoms (Fisher's exact test). Note that some of these symptoms can also be caused by microsporidial and bacterial infections. Thus, the diagnostic of a viral infection based on the cellular symptoms requires an otherwise clean culture.</p>

<p><bold>Quantification of GFP transgene expression and silencing.</bold> (Top) Reporter genes are expressed in a larger proportion of animals from N2 compared to JU1580. Shown are the number of animals according to binned log<sub>2</sub> DsRed intensities. Each line corresponds to one flow cytometry run with colors indicating strain and treatment as explained in the color legend. The extrachromosomal array was inherited more efficiently in N2 than in JU1580, making it necessary to analyze only those animals carrying the array. (Bottom) Each data point corresponds to the difference between treatment with GFP RNAi and empty vector in N2 (blue) and JU1580 (red) observed for animals with log<sub>2</sub> DsRed intensity in a given bin. Dots indicate the difference between the means of median log<sub>2</sub>(GFP/DsRed) ratios for treatment with GFP RNAi and empty vector. Vertical bars indicate standard errors. The cutoff for DsRed intensities is indicated in both panels by a vertical dotted line.</p>
